00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:03,603
COFFEE.

2
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:04,804
THANK YOU.

3
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:06,006
CAPPUCCINO.

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,607
GRAZIE.

5
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:10,010
A NICE HOT CIDER FOR MONICA.

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,611
AW, THANK YOU.

7
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:12,812
RACH?

8
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:14,014
YEAH?

9
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,516
WHY DOES MY CINNAMON STICK HAVE AN ERASER?

10
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,118
OH...

11
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:22,122
OH... THAT'S WHY.

12
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,524
I'M SORRY.

13
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:32,032

26
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:18,978

27
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,382
CHANDLER...

28
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,583
MISS TEDLOCK

29
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,585
YOU'RE LOOKING LOVELY TODAY.

30
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,786
AND MAY I SAY

31
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,989
THAT IS A VERY FLATTERING SLEEVE LENGTH ON YOU.

32
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,692
YES. WELL... MR. KOSTELIC WOULD LIKE YOU

33
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:35,895
TO STOP BY HIS OFFICE AT THE END OF THE DAY.

34
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:39,099
OH, LISTEN, IF THIS IS ABOUT THOSE PRANK MEMOS

35
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,501
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM--

36
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:42,802
REALLY, NOTHING AT ALL. REALLY.

37
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,307
AND, FRANKLY, I DON'T THINK THAT THOSE KIND OF SHENANIGANS

38
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,110
HAVE A PLACE IN AN OFFICE ENVIRONMENT.

39
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,118
HEY, YOU GUYS--

40
00:01:58,518 --> 00:01:59,719
CHANDLER'S COMING, AND HE SAYS

41
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,321
HE HAS THIS, LIKE, INCREDIBLE NEWS.

42
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,124
SO WHEN HE GETS HERE, LET'S ALL ACT LIKE...

43
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,325
HEY.

44
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,527
NEVER MIND, BUT IT WAS GOING

45
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,429
TO BE REALLY GOOD.

46
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,330
WHAT'S GOING ON?

47
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,531
WHAT'S UP?

48
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:12,732
SO IT'S A TYPICAL DAY AT WORK--

49
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:13,933
I'M PUTTING MY NUMBERS--

50
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,735
AND BIG AL CALLS ME INTO HIS OFFICE

51
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,938
AND TELLS ME HE WANTS TO MAKE ME PROCESSING SUPERVISOR.

52
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,140
THAT IS GREAT!

53
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,341
CONGRATULATIONS.

54
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,643
SO... I QUIT.

55
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,645
WHY? WHY?

56
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,047
WHY? THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A TEMP JOB.

57
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,049
CHANDLER, YOU'VE BEEN THERE FOR FIVE YEARS.

58
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,051
BUT IF I TOOK THIS PROMOTION

59
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:35,655
IT'D BE LIKE ADMITTING THAT THIS IS WHAT I ACTUALLY DO.

60
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,457
OH, MAN, DOES THAT MEAN

61
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,660
WE GOT TO START BUYING OUR OWN TOILET PAPER?

62
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,262
THAT WAS JOEY TRIBBIANI

63
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,264
WITH THE BIG PICTURE. DAN?

64
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,666
SO IS IT A LOT MORE MONEY?

65
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,967
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

66
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,770
I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE ONE OF THOSE GUYS

67
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,573
THAT'S IN HIS OFFICE UNTIL 12:00 AT NIGHT

68
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,175
WORRYING ABOUT THE WEENUS.

69
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,377
THE... THE WEENUS?

70
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,579
"WEEKLY ESTIMATED NET USAGE SYSTEMS."

71
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,181
IT'S A PROCESSING TERM.

72
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,185
OH... THAT WEENUS.

73
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:06,886
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

74
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:07,687
I DON'T KNOW

75
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,289
WHAT I WANT TO DO

76
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,291
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO FIGURE IT OUT WORKING THERE.

77
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,494
OH! I HAVE SOMETHING YOU CAN DO.

78
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,095
I HAVE THIS NEW

79
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,697
MASSAGE CLIENT-- STEVE.

80
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,800
ANYWAY, HE'S OPENING UP A RESTAURANT

81
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,603
AND HE'S LOOKING FOR A HEAD CHEF.

82
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,406
UM... HI, THERE.

83
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,607
HI.

84
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,609
OH, YEAH, I KNOW, YOU'RE A CHEF

85
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,211
AND I THOUGHT OF YOU FIRST

86
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:32,812
BUT CHANDLER'S THE ONE

87
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,814
WHO NEEDS A JOB RIGHT NOW, SO...

88
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,420
I JUST DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CHEFFING EXPERIENCE.

89
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,223
UNLESS IT'S AN ALL TOAST RESTAURANT.

90
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,524
YEAH, YEAH.

91
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,926
WHAT KIND OF FOOD IS HE LOOKING FOR?

92
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,928
HE WANTS TO DO SOMETHING ECLECTIC

93
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,530
SO HE'S LOOKING FOR SOMEONE

94
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,532
WHO CAN CREATE THE ENTIRE MENU.

95
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,733
OH, MY GOD!

96
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,934
YEAH, I KNOW.

97
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,536
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

98
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,837
THANKS, PHEEB.

99
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:01,441
I JUST DON'T REALLY SEE MYSELF IN A BIG WHITE HAT.

100
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,342
OKAY.

101
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,945
OH, MONICA, GUESS WHAT!

102
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,851
 A big run up, and there he goes!

103
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,052
A perfect heave!

104
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,954
YOU WATCH SOMETHING LIKE THIS

105
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:18,157
AND YOU REALIZE WHY EVOLUTION IS JUST A THEORY.

106
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,365
CAN YOU SEE MY NIPPLES THROUGH THIS SHIRT?

107
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,767
N NO.

108
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,371
BUT DON'T WORRY-- I'M SURE THEY'RE STILL THERE.

109
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,772
WHERE ARE YOU GOING

110
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,073
MR. SUITY MAN?

111
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,377
WELL, I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE DR. ROBERT PILLMAN--

112
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,379
CAREER COUNSELOR A GO GO.

113
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,982
I ADDED THE "A GO GO."

114
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,183
CAREER COUNSELOR?

115
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:47,387
HEY, YOU GUYS ALL KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

116
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,588
I DON'T.

117
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,391
HEY, YOU GUYS IN THE LIVING ROOM ALL KNOW

118
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,393
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

119
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,595
YOU HAVE GOALS, YOU HAVE DREAMS.

120
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,196
I DON'T HAVE A DREAM.

121
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:00,700
AH, THE LESSER KNOWN "I DON'T HAVE A DREAM" SPEECH.

122
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,104
OH, I LOVE MY LIFE! I LOVE MY LIFE!

123
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:08,308
BRIAN'S SONG!

124
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,509
 THE MEETING

125
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,511
WITH THAT GUY WENT GREAT?

126
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,912
IT WAS SO GREAT.

127
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,914
HE SHOWED ME WHERE THE RESTAURANT'S GOING TO BE.

128
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,516
IT'S THIS CUTE LITTLE PLACE ON 10th STREET.

129
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,518
IT'S NOT TOO BIG, IT'S NOT TOO SMALL.

130
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,719
IT'S JUST RIGHT.

131
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,120
WAS IT FORMERLY OWNED

132
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,923
BY A BLOND WOMAN AND SOME BEARS?

133
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,326
SO, ANYWAY, I'M COOKING DINNER FOR HIM MONDAY NIGHT.

134
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,527
KIND OF LIKE AN AUDITION.

135
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,529
PHOEBE, HE REALLY WANTS YOU TO BE HERE.

136
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,930
WHICH WOULD BE GREAT FOR ME

137
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,532
BECAUSE YOU CAN MAKE YUMMY NOISES.

138
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,433
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING?

139
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,634
YUMMY NOISES.

140
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,238
AND, MONICA, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE?

141
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,841
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S JUST GOT TO BE SO GREAT.

142
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,243
OH! I KNOW WHAT YOU COULD MAKE.

143
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:47,447
YOU SHOULD MAKE THAT THING WITH THE STUFF.

144
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,850
YOU KNOW THAT... THING.

145
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,452
WITH THE STUFF.

146
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,254
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW.

147
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,856
HEY, GUYS, DOES ANYONE KNOW

148
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,659
A GOOD DATE PLACE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

149
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,661
UH... HOW ABOUT TONY'S?

150
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,864
IF YOU CAN FINISH A 32 OUNCE STEAK, IT'S FREE.

151
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,967
OKAY.

152
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,370
HEY, DOES ANYONE KNOW A GOOD PLACE

153
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,372
IF YOU'RE NOT DATING A PUMA?

154
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,273
WHO ARE YOU GOING OUT WITH?

155
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,275
OH! IS THIS THE BUG LADY?

156
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,477

157
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,879
"I LOVE YOU, ROSS."

158
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,481
HER NAME IS CELIA.

159
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,082
SHE'S NOT A BUG LADY.

160
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,885
SHE'S CURATOR OF INSECTS AT THE MUSEUM.

161
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,688
SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO DO?

162
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,690
I JUST THOUGHT WE'D GO OUT TO DINNER

163
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,692
AND THEN MAYBE BRING HER BACK TO MY PLACE

164
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,293
AND I'D INTRODUCE HER

165
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,595
TO MY MONKEY.

166
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:39,499
AND HE'S NOT SPEAKING METAPHORICALLY.

167
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,203
SOOO... BACK TO YOUR PLACE.

168
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,006
YOU'RE THINKIN' MAYBE... HEH HEH?

169
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,409

170
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,211
WELL, I DON'T KNOW, HEH HEH.

171
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,415
I'M HOPING, HEH HEH.

172
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,618
I'M TELLING YOU-- THAT MONKEY IS A CHICK MAGNET.

173
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:02,221
SHE'S GOING TO TAKE ONE LOOK AT HIS FURRY, CUTE LITTLE FACE

174
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,923
AND IT'LL SEAL THE DEAL.

175
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,525

176
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,126
HE'S NOT GOING TO HURT YOU.

177
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,529
SOOTHING TONES, CELIA. SOOTHING TONES.

178
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,731

179
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,332
MARCEL, MARCEL, 'NANA...

180
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,635
I CAN'T STAND THIS.

181
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,637
HE'S GOT HIS CLAWS ON MY...

182
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:18,838
ALL RIGHT.

183
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,849
OKAY. TRY THIS SALMON MOUSSE.

184
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,251
MMM. GOOD.

185
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,455
YEAH? IS IT BETTER THAN THE OTHER SALMON MOUSSE?

186
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,056
IT'S CREAMIER.

187
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,459
YEAH. WELL, IS THAT BETTER?

188
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,060
I DON'T KNOW.

189
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,463
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHIPPED FISH, MONICA.

190
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,765
I'M JUST HAPPY I'M KEEPING IT DOWN.

191
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,171
OH, MY GOD!

192
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,173
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

193
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,276
EIGHT AND A HALF HOURS OF APTITUDE TESTS

194
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,679
INTELLIGENCE TESTS, PERSONALITY TESTS

195
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,681
AND WHAT DO I LEARN?

196
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,884
"YOU ARE IDEALLY SUITED FOR A CAREER IN DATA PROCESSING

197
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,286
FOR A LARGE MULTINATIONAL COOPERATION."

198
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,188
THAT'S SO GREAT

199
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:12,191
BECAUSE YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.

200
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,594
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

201
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,895
DON'T I SEEM LIKE SOMEBODY

202
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,897
WHO SHOULD BE DOING SOMETHING REALLY COOL?

203
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:21,901
I JUST ALWAYS PICTURED MYSELF DOING SOMETHING...

204
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,503
SOMETHING.

205
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,505
OH, CHANDLER, I KNOW.

206
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,507
I KNOW.

207
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,708
OH, HEY!

208
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,710
YOU CAN SEE YOUR NIPPLES

209
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,612
THROUGH THIS SHIRT.

210
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,114
HERE YOU GO.

211
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,116
MAYBE THIS WILL CHEER YOU UP.

212
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,919
I HAD A GRAPE ABOUT FIVE HOURS AGO

213
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,321
SO I BETTER SPLIT THIS WITH YOU.

214
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,724
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THAT SMALL.

215
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,726
IT'S A PRE APPETIZER.

216
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,529
THE FRENCH CALL IT ANAMUSE BOUCHE.

217
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:56,335
WELL, IT... IT IS "AMOOZING."

218
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,138

219
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,942
HELLO.

220
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,544
OH, HI, WENDY.

221
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,145
YEAH, 8:00.

222
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,948
WHAT DID WE SAY, TEN DOLLARS AN HOUR?

223
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,450
OKAY, GREAT.

224
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,853
ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU THEN. BYE.

225
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,454
TEN DOLLARS AN HOUR FOR WHAT?

226
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:16,956
I ASKED ONE OF THE WAITRESSES AT WORK

227
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,157
IF SHE WOULD HELP ME OUT.

228
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,159
WAITRESSING?

229
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,761
UH OH.

230
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:26,566
WELL, OF COURSE I THOUGHT OF YOU.

231
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,068
BUT... BUT...

232
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,169
BUT BUT?

233
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,572
BUT, YOU SEE

234
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,576
THIS NIGHT HAS TO GO JUST PERFECT, YOU KNOW.

235
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,980
WELL, WENDY'S MORE OF A... PROFESSIONAL WAITRESS.

236
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,381
OH. I SEE.

237
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,983
YES, AND I'VE SORT OF BEEN

238
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,585
MAINTAINING MY AMATEUR STATUS

239
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,987
SO THAT I CAN WAITRESS IN THE OLYMPICS.

240
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,693
YOU KNOW, I DON'T MEAN TO BRAG

241
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,495
BUT I WAITED TABLES AT INNSBRUCK IN '76.

242
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,899
TOOK HOME A BRONZE.

243
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,605
AMUSE BOUCHE?

244
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:16,415
? YOU'LL BE ALL ALONE SOMEDAY. ?

245
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,421

246
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,023
TALK TO ME.

247
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,324
OKAY, UH...

248
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,525

249
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,527
A WEIRD THING HAPPENED TO ME

250
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,529
ON THE TRAIN THIS MORNING.

251
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,231
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

252
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,233
TALK DIRTY.

253
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:40,940
WELL... HERE?

254
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,541
AH...

255
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,144
SAY SOMETHING... HOT.

256
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,445
UH...

257
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,647
UM...

258
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,848
WHAT?

259
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:49,649
WH...

260
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,850
WHAT?

261
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,852

262
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,453
UM...

263
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:55,655
WHAT?

264
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,256
VULVA.

265
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,971
"VULVA"?

266
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,474
ALL RIGHT, I PANICKED, ALL RIGHT?

267
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:18,277
SHE... SHE TOOK ME BY SURPRISE.

268
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,179
BUT IT WASN'T A TOTAL LOSS.

269
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,581
I MEAN, UH, WE ENDED UP CUDDLING.

270
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,883
WHOA, YOU CUDDLED?

271
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,484
HOW MANY TIMES?

272
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:26,986
SHUT UP. IT WAS NICE.

273
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,988
I DIDN'T... I JUST DON'T THINK

274
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,191
I'M THE DIRTY TALKING KIND OF GUY, YOU KNOW?

275
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:33,492
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

276
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,494
YOU JUST SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO DO TO HER

277
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,496
OR WHAT YOU WANT HER TO DO TO YOU

278
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,498
OR WHAT YOU THINK OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT

279
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:40,700
BE DOING TO EACH OTHER.

280
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,401
LOOK. I TELL YOU WHAT.

281
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,403
TRY SOMETHING ON ME.

282
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,607
PLEASE BE KIDDING.

283
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,311
WHY NOT? COME ON.

284
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,313
JUST... JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES

285
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,315
AND TELL ME WHAT YOU'D LIKE

286
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,117
TO BE DOING RIGHT NOW.

287
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,523
OKAY. I'M, UH... I'M IN MY APARTMENT...

288
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,225
YEAH... WHAT ELSE?

289
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,426
THAT'S IT.

290
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,629
I'M IN MY APARTMENT. YOU'RE NOT THERE.

291
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,931
WE'RE NOT HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.

292
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,532
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I'LL START, OKAY?

293
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:14,734
JOEY, PLEASE.

294
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,736
COME ON, COME ON. READY? LOOK.

295
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,738
OH, ROSS...

296
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,040
YOU GET ME SO HOT.

297
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,641
I WANT YOUR LIPS

298
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,643
ON ME NOW.

299
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:25,444
HUH?

300
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,046
HMM.

301
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,647
ALL RIGHT.

302
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,249
NOW YOU SAY SOMETHING.

303
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,251
I, UH, I REALLY DON'T THINK SO.

304
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,253
YOU LIKE THIS WOMAN, RIGHT?

305
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,454
WELL, YEAH.

306
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,456
YOU WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN, RIGHT?

307
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,257
SURE.

308
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,659
IF YOU CAN'T TALK DIRTY TO ME

309
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,062
HOW YOU GOING TO TALK DIRTY TO HER?

310
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,865
NOW TELL ME YOU WANT TO CARESS MY BUTT.

311
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,068
OKAY. TURN AROUND.

312
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,172
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU STARING AT ME

313
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,373
WHEN I'M DOING THIS.

314
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,975
ALL RIGHT, I'M NOT LOOKING.

315
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,576
GO AHEAD.

316
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,578
OKAY, OKAY.

317
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,780

318
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,381
I WANT...

319
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,985
OKAY, I WANT TO... FEEL YOUR...

320
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,788
HOT, SOFT SKIN WITH MY LIPS.

321
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,590
THERE YOU GO.

322
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,993
KEEP GOING. KEEP GOING.

323
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:21,200
I, UH... I WANT TO TAKE MY TONGUE, AND...

324
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,810
AND, AND...

325
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,812
SAY IT.

326
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,816
SAY IT!

327
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,419
RUN IT ALL OVER YOUR BODY UNTIL YOU'RE...

328
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,224
...TREMBLING WITH... WITH...

329
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:06,145
WITH...?

330
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,547
FUNNY STORY.

331
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:09,748
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS.

332
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,350
NO, NO, NO. SHH! IT'S OKAY.

333
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,954
I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU TWO KIDS TO GET TOGETHER.

334
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,358
THE TREMBLING THING WAS NICE.

335
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,559
SHUT UP.

336
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,561
HEY, CHANDLER, WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING

337
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,563
THAT GUY FROM YOUR OLD JOB CALLED AGAIN.

338
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:25,764
OH, AGAIN?

339
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,266
AND AGAIN AND AGAIN

340
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,868
AND AGAIN. AND AGAIN.

341
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,469

342
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,672
HELLO.

343
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,274
AND AGAIN.

344
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,676
HI, MR. KOSTELIC.

345
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,279
HOW'S LIFE ON THE 15th FLOOR?

346
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,281
YEAH. I MISS YOU, TOO.

347
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,683
IT'S A LOT LESS SATISFYING

348
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,887
TO STEAL PENS FROM YOUR OWN HOME, YOU KNOW?

349
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,689
WELL, THAT'S VERY GENEROUS.

350
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,091
BUT LOOK.

351
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,592
THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE MONEY.

352
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,194
I NEED SOMETHING MORE THAN A JOB.

353
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,196
I NEED SOMETHING I REALLY CARE ABOUT.

354
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,598
AND THAT'S ON TOP OF THE YEAR END BONUS STRUCTURE

355
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:00,799
YOU MENTIONED EARLIER?

356
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,801
DREAM. DREAM.

357
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,103
LOOK, AL. AL...

358
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,505
I'M NOT PLAYING HARDBALL HERE.

359
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,107
THIS IS NOT A NEGOTIATION.

360
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,708
THIS IS AREJECTION.

361
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,912
NO... NO. NO. NO. STOP SAYING... STOP SAYING NUMBERS.

362
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,714
I'M TELLING YOU, YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUY.

363
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,316
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUY!

364
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,918
I'LL SEE YOU MONDAY!

365
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,923
NYAH.

366
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,931
HUH?

367
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,132
OH, WOW!

368
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,534
IT'S HUGE!

369
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,337
THIS IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN THE CUBICLE.

370
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,439
OH, THIS IS A CUBE.

371
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,041
LOOK AT THIS.

372
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,344

373
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,746
YOU HAVE A WINDOW!

374
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,950
YES, INDEEDY.

375
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,751
WITH A BEAUTIFUL VIEW OF...

376
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:55,154
OH, LOOK. THAT GUY'S PEEING.

377
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,556
OKAY. THAT'S ENOUGH OF THE VIEW.

378
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,959
CHECK THIS OUT. LOOK AT THIS.

379
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,961
OKAY. SIT DOWN HERE.

380
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,761
OKAY.

381
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,763
THIS IS GOOD. THIS IS GREAT.

382
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,365

383
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,568
HELEN, COULD YOU COME IN HERE FOR A MOMENT?

384
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,874
THANK YOU, HELEN.

385
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,276
THAT'LL BE ALL.

386
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:22,081
LAST TIME I DO THAT, I PROMISE.

387
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,587
SHE DOESN'T SEEM VERY WARM.

388
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,589
I KNOW. SHE HAS, LIKE, NO PERSONALITY.

389
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:31,790
Uh-uh!

390
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:38,497
WENDY, DON'T DO THIS TO ME.

391
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,499
WENDY, WE HAD A DEAL.

392
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,302
YEAH. YOU PROMISED.

393
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,903
WENDY... WENDY...

394
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,505
WENDY!

395
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,706

396
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,310
WHO WAS THAT?

397
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,913
WENDY BAILED.

398
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,915
I... I HAVE NO WAITRESS.

399
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:00,019
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

400
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,021
BYE BYE.

401
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,223
TEN DOLLARS AN HOUR.

402
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,424
NO.

403
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,725
$12 DOLLARS AN HOUR.

404
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,629
MON, I WISH I COULD, BUT I'VE MADE PLANS TO WALK AROUND.

405
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,831
RACHEL, WHEN YOU RAN OUT ON YOUR WEDDING

406
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,433
I WAS THERE FOR YOU.

407
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,035
I PUT A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD

408
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,037
AND IF THAT MEANS NOTHING TO YOU...

409
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,840

00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,743

OH, THANK YOU.

00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,980
WOULD YOU LIKE A TOUR?

426
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,383
I WAS JUST BEING POLITE, BUT ALL RIGHT.

427
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,986
WHAT?

428
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,188
WHAT'S UP?

429
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,190

00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,608
IS IT DRY IN HERE?

437
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,314
LET ME... LET ME GET YOU SOME WINE.

438
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,117
I THINK WE'RE READY FOR OUR FIRST COURSE.

WELL, SMACK MY ASS AND CALL ME JUDY.

OH, GOSH, I'M SO GLAD YOU LIKE THEM.

446
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,747
LIKE THEM? I COULD EAT 100 OF THEM.

447
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,550
OH. WELL, THAT'S ALL THERE IS OF THESE

448
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,353

00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,763
TARTLETS?

453
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,566
THE WORD HAS LOST ALL MEANING.

00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:34,973
EXCUSE ME.

455
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,376

456
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,179

457
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,493

00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,397
OH, COOL! TACO SHELLS!

YOU KNOW WHAT?

461
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,306
YOU DON'T WANT TO SPOIL YOUR APPETITE.

462
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,608
HEY, SUGAR Os!

463
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:13,612

GIVE THEM TO ME.

476
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,446
WE'LL SHARE.

477
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,247
NO.

478
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,448
GIVE ME THE BEARS.

479
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,049
THEN YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY!

480
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,552
OH! OH!

481
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,153
BEARS OVERBOARD!

482
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,755
THEY'RE DROWNING.

483
00:20:58,156 --> 00:20:59,558
DON'T JUST STAND THERE.

484
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,159
CALL 911.

485
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,761
HEY, FELLAS!

00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,363
GRAB ON TO A SUGAR O.

487
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:05,964
SAVE YOURSELVES.

488
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,767
HELP! HELP! WE'RE DROWNING!

489
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,169
HELP! HELP!

490
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,971
THAT'S IT! DINNER IS OVER.

491
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,773
WHAT? WHY?

492
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,375
"WHAT"? "WHY"?

493
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,377
WONDER IF I CAME INTO YOUR OFFICE

494
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,778
AND I STARTED... AND...

495
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,780
I CAN'T THINK OF AN EXAMPLE, OKAY?

496
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,382
IT'S JUST I'VE WAITED SEVEN YEARS

497
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,583
FOR AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THIS

498
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,585
AND YOU CAN'T WAIT FOUR AND A HALF MINUTES

499
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,186
FOR A STUPID ONION TARTLET?

500
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:29,788

501
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,390
HEY!

502
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,597
 SO I TOLD HIM

503
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,198
I'M SORRY.

504
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,800
THAT'S JUST HOW I FEEL.

505
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,202
AND HE TOLD ME I HARSHED HIS BUZZ.

506
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,004
AND THEN I SAID

507
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,306
"DON'T EAT THAT.

508
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,907
IT'S A KITCHEN MAGNET."

509
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,911
AND HE DIDN'T LISTEN

510
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:56,114
SO WE LEFT HIM IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

511
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,116
OH, MON, I'M SORRY.

512
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,519
WHAT A TOOL.

513
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,720
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

514
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,623
YOU DON'T WANT TO WORK FOR A GUY LIKE THAT.

515
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:05,524
I KNOW. IT'S JUST...

516
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,327
I JUST THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS, YOU KNOW, IT.

517
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,528
YOU'LL GET THERE.

518
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,729
YOU'RE AN AMAZING CHEF.

519
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,731
YEAH. YOU KNOW ALL THOSE YUMMY NOISES?

520
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,932
I WASN'T FAKING.

521
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,734
OH, BY THE WAY

522
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,636
AM I GOING TO GET PAID

523
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:18,737
FOR THE FULL THREE HOURS?

524
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,339
JUST A QUESTION.

525
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,741
TALK ABOUT IT LATER.

526
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:28,847
SO, UH, HOW DID IT GO WITH CELIA?

527
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:32,451
OH, UH, I WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

528
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,453
ALL RIGHT,ROSS!

529
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,656
I WAS THE JAMES MICHENER OF DIRTY TALK.

530
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:41,259
IT WAS THE MOST ELABORATE FILTH YOU HAVE EVER HEARD.

531
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:44,062
I MEAN, THERE WERE CHARACTERS, PLOT LINES

532
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,664
THEMES, A MOTIF...

533
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:48,867
AT ONE POINT, THERE WERE VILLAGERS.

534
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,870
OH, HO HO, AND, UH, HUH...?

535
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,474
WELL, BY THE TIME WE FINISHED WITH ALL THE DIRTY TALK

536
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:56,675
IT WAS KIND OF LATE

537
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,478
AND WE WERE BOTH KIND OF EXHAUSTED, SO, UM...

538
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:00,278
YOU CUDDLED.

539
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,381
WHICH WAS NICE.

540
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,382
YOU GUYS WANT TO TRY

541
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,384
TO CATCH A LATE MOVIE OR SOMETHING?

542
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,585
SHOULDN'T WE

543
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:07,886
WAIT FOR CHANDLER?

544
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,288
WHOA. WHERE THE HELL IS HE?

545
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,991
YES, FRAN, I KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS

546
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:16,995
BUT I'M LOOKING AT THE WEENUS, AND I'M NOT HAPPY.

547
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,597
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

548
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,800
YOU WILL CARE ABOUT IT BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT IT.

549
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,802
YOU GOT IT? GOOD!

550
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:29,007
WHOA...

551
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,018
HOW'S THIS?

552
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:40,819

553
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,020
SORRY.

554
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,221
HOW ABOUT OVER HERE?

555
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,022

556
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,024
SEE? THAT JUST MEANS IT'S WORKING.

557
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:46,825
DOES THIS HURT?

558
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:47,926
NO.

559
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:48,727
HOW ABOUT THIS?

560
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,328

561
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,930
THERE YOU GO.

563
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,936

564
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,739
AH, OOH, AH... OH, I'M GOING TO THROW UP.
