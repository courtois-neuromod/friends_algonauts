1
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:07,507
OOH, ALL RIGHT! YOU GUYS, IT'S STARTING TO SNOW.

2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,708
OH! GREAT!

3
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:13,213
OOH, AND, LOOK. UGLY NAKED GUY IS HANGING CANDY CANES.

4
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:15,315
WHERE?

5
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,717
OH...

6
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:21,321
WELL... THAT'S FESTIVE.

7
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:26,526
GUYS, THERE'S SOMEBODY I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET.

8
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,628

9
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:30,230
WAIT.

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,131
WHAT IS THAT?

11
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,133
THAT WOULD BE MARCEL. YOU WANT TO SAY HI?

12
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,234
NO, NO, I DON'T.

13
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,435
OH, HE IS PRECIOUS.

14
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,037
WHERE DID YOU GET HIM?

15
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,139
MY FRIEND, BETHEL, RESCUED HIM FROM SOME LAB.

16
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,640
THAT IS SO CRUEL.

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,244
WHY? WHY WOULD A PARENT NAME THEIR CHILD BETHEL?

18
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,149
HEY, THAT MONKEY'S GOT A ROSS ON HIS ASS.

19
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,955
ROSS, IS HE GOING TO LIVE WITH YOU?

20
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,857
LIKE, IN YOUR APARTMENT?

21
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,459
YEAH. I MEAN, IT'S BEEN KIND OF QUIET

22
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,161
SINCE CAROL LEFT, SO...

23
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,762
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GET A ROOMMATE?

24
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:04,364
AAH, I DON'T KNOW.

25
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,565
I THINK YOU REACH A CERTAIN AGE

26
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,567
HAVING A ROOMMATE IS JUST KIND OF PATHE...

27
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:10,870
UH... I'M SORRY.

28
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:11,871
THAT'S THAT'S "PATHET."

29
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,274
WHICH IS SANSKRIT FOR "REALLY COOL WAY TO LIVE."

43
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,726
SO, YOU GUYS, I'M DOING ALL NEW MATERIAL TONIGHT.

44
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:09,929
I HAVE 12 NEW SONGS ABOUT MY MOTHER'S SUICIDE

45
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,931
AND ONE ABOUT A SNOWMAN.

46
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,935
MIGHT WANT TO OPEN WITH THE SNOWMAN.

47
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:17,937
HI, JOEY.

48
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:19,139
HEY.

49
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,140
HI, BUDDY.

50
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,341
SO, HOW'D IT GO?

51
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,942
I DIDN'T GET THE JOB.

52
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,544

53
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,346
HOW COULD YOU NOT GET IT?

54
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,348
YOU WERE SANTA LAST YEAR.

55
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,949
I DON'T KNOW.

56
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,553
SOME FAT GUY'S SLEEPING WITH THE STORE MANAGER.

57
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,155
HE'S NOT EVEN JOLLY.

58
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,756
IT'S ALL POLITICAL.

59
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,958
SO, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE?

60
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,361
I'M GOING TO BE ONE OF HIS HELPERS

61
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,164
BUT IT'S JUST SUCH A SLAP IN THE FACE, YOU KNOW?

62
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,566
DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING

63
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:47,767
FOR NEW YEAR'S?

64
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,170

65
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,771
WHAT IS WRONG WITH NEW YEAR'S?

66
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,373
NOTHING FOR YOU. YOU HAVE PAOLO.

67
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,775
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FACE THE HORRIBLE PRESSURES

68
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,178
OF THIS HOLIDAY  THE DESPERATE SCRAMBLE

69
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,379
TO FIND ANYTHING WITH LIPS

70
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,582
JUST SO YOU HAVE SOMEBODY TO KISS WHEN THE BALL DROPS!

71
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:03,783
MAN, I'M TALKING LOUD.

72
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,385
WELL, FOR YOUR INFORMATION

73
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,787
PAOLO IS GOING TO BE IN ROME THIS NEW YEAR'S

74
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:10,190
SO I'LL BE JUST AS PATHETIC AS THE REST OF YOU.

75
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,692
YEAH. YOU WISH.

76
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,694
I'VE GOT AN IDEA  DINNER.

77
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,696
IT'S PERFECT.

78
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,398
WE'LL PUT IT BETWEEN LUNCH AND BREAKFAST.

79
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,999

80
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,502
IT'S JUST THAT I AM SICK OF BEING A VICTIM

81
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,504
TO THIS DICK CLARK HOLIDAY.

82
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,105
I SAY THIS YEAR, NO DATES.

83
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:29,309
WE MAKE A PACT-- JUST THE SIX OF US. DINNER.

84
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,110
SURE. FINE. OKAY.

85
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,913
NO, I WAS HOPING FOR A LITTLE MORE ENTHUSIASM.

86
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,315
WHOO! YAY!

87
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,316
SOUNDS GREAT.

88
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,517
PHOEBE, YOU'RE ON.

89
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,118
OH. OH, GOOD.

90
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,220
OKAY, HI.

91
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,821
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN

92
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,823
BACK BY POPULAR DEMAND

93
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,425
MISS PHOEBE BUFFAY.

94
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,427

95
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,829
HI.

96
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,830
THANKS. HI.

97
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,233
UM... I WANT TO START WITH A SONG

98
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,035
THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME THIS TIME OF YEAR.

99
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,644
? I MADE A MAN WITH EYES OF COAL ?

100
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,947
? AND A SMILE SO BEWITCHING ?

101
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,149
? HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW ?

102
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,153
? THAT MY MOM WAS DEAD IN THE KITCHEN? ?

103
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:21,261
? LA, LA LA, LA, LA LA... ?

104
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:25,265
? ...MY MOTHER'S ASHES ?

105
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,868
? EVEN HER EYELASHES ?

106
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:35,275
? ARE RESTING IN A LITTLE YELLOW JAR ?

107
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,878
? AND SOMETIMES WHEN IT'S BREEZY ?

108
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,981
? OR IF I FEEL A LITTLE SNEEZY ?

109
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:42,782
? AND... ?

110
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,784
EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME.

111
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:45,985
NOISY BOYS.

112
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,490
IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE

113
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,691
WITH THE ENTIRE GROUP?

114
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,894
NO. NO, THAT'S OKAY.

115
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,095
WELL, COME ON.

116
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:59,699
IF IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO DISCUSS WHILE I'M PLAYING

117
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,101
THEN I ASSUME IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH

118
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,404
FOR EVERYONE ELSE TO HEAR.

119
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,206
THAT GUY'S GOING HOME WITH A NOTE.

120
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,909
AHEM. AHEM.

121
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,911
I WAS... I WAS JUST SAYING...

122
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,513
COULD YOU SPEAK UP, PLEASE?

123
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,714
SORRY. I WAS...

124
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:15,915
I WAS JUST SAYING TO MY FRIEND

125
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,318
THAT I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

126
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,519
THAT I'D EVER SEEN

127
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,720
IN MY LIFE

128
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,921
AND THEN HE SAID...

129
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:22,722
YOU SAID YOU THOUGHT

130
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,124
DARYL HANNAH WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

131
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,726
THAT HE'D EVER SEEN IN HIS LIFE

132
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,128
AND I SAID, "YEAH, I LIKED HER IN SPLASH A LOT

133
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,130
BUT NOT SO MUCH IN WALL STREET."

134
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,332
I THOUGHT SHE HAD...

135
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,132
A HARD QUALITY.

136
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,134
AND, UH... WHILE DARYL HANNAH

137
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,337
IS BEAUTIFUL IN A CONVENTIONAL WAY

138
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,940
YOU ARE LUMINOUS WITH A KIND OF A DELICATE GRACE.

139
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,845
THEN THAT'S WHEN YOU STARTED YELLING.

140
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:55,655
OKAY. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A SHORT BREAK.

141
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,663
THAT GUY'S GOING HOME WITH MORE THAN A NOTE.

142
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,471
COME HERE, MARCEL. SIT HERE.

143
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,072

144
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:16,676
PHEEBS, I CAN'T BELIEVE HE HASN'T KISSED YOU YET.

145
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,078
I MEAN, GOD, BY MY SIXTH DATE WITH PAOLO

146
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,382
HE'D ALREADY NAMED BOTH MY BREASTS.

147
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,988
WHOA, DID I JUST SHARE TOO MUCH?

148
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,391
JUST A SMIDGE.

149
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,193
DAVID'S, LIKE, YOU KNOW, A SCIENTIST GUY.

150
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,395
HE'S VERY METHODICAL.

151
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:36,696
I THINK IT'S ROMANTIC.

152
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,297
ME, TOO, OH!

153
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,700
DID YOU EVER SEE AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN?

154
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,901
YEAH.

155
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,503
WELL, HE'S KIND OF LIKE

156
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,505
THE GUY I WENT TO SEE THAT WITH.

157
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,309
EXCEPT...

158
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:54,514
EXCEPT HE'S SMARTER AND GENTLER AND SWEETER.

159
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:55,615
I JUST... I JUST WANT

160
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,418
TO BE WITH HIM ALL THE TIME.

161
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,820
YOU KNOW, DAY AND NIGHT...

162
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,422
AND NIGHT AND DAY

163
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,424
AND SPECIAL OCCASIONS.

164
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,726
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT. I SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING.

165
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,128
YOU'RE GOING TO ASK HIM TO NEW YEAR'S, AREN'T YOU?

166
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,730
YOU'RE GOING TO BREAK THE PACT.

167
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,632
SHE'S GOING TO BREAK THE PACT.

168
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:13,833
NO. NO. NO. NO. NO.

169
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,034
NO.

170
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,235
YEAH, COULD I JUST..?

171
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,240
YEAH, BECAUSE I ALREADY ASKED JANICE.

172
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,242
COME ON. THIS WAS A PACT.

173
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,844
THIS WAS YOUR PACT.

174
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:25,645
I SNAPPED, OKAY?

175
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,647
I COULDN'T HANDLE THE PRESSURE AND I SNAPPED.

176
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,850
BUT JANICE? THAT WAS, LIKE, THE WORST BREAKUP IN HISTORY.

177
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,653
I'M NOT SAYING IT WAS A GOOD IDEA.

178
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,555
I'M SAYING I SNAPPED.

179
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,157
HI. SORRY I'M LATE.

180
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,168
TOO MANY JOKES.

181
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,971
MUST MOCK JOEY.

182
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,776
NICE SHOES, HUH?

183
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,178
AH! YOU'RE KILLING ME!

184
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,782
OH, ROSS.

185
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,884
HE'S PLAYING WITH MY SPATULAS AGAIN.

186
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,286
LOOK, HE'S NOT GOING TO HURT THEM, RIGHT?

187
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,288
DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BRING HIM HERE?

188
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,593
LOOK, I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE HIM ALONE, ALL RIGHT?

189
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,595
WE HAD OUR FIRST FIGHT THIS MORNING.

190
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,998
I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH MY WORKING LATE.

191
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:23,803
I SAID SOME THINGS THAT I DIDN'T MEAN AND...

192
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,404
HE THREW SOME FECES.

193
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,510
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE GOING TO WORK LATE

194
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,111
I CAN LOOK IN ON HIM FOR YOU.

195
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,513
OH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

196
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,915
OKAY, BUT IF YOU DO, MAKE SURE IT SEEMS

197
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,317
LIKE YOU'RE THERE TO SEE HIM, OKAY?

198
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,120
AND YOU'RE NOT, LIKE, DOING IT AS A FAVOR TO ME.

199
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,223
OKAY, BUT IF HE ASKS, I'M NOT GOING TO LIE.

200
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,432
BUT YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY TEST THIS THEORY

201
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,434
BECAUSE TODAY'S PARTICLE ACCELERATORS

202
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:59,438
ARE NOWHERE NEAR POWERFUL ENOUGH TO SIMULATE THESE CONDITIONS.

203
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:00,439
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

204
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,942
I HAVE A QUESTION THEN. YEAH?

205
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,344
WERE YOU PLANNING ON KISSING ME, EVER?

206
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,851
UH... THAT'S DEFINITELY A VALID QUESTION

207
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:15,054
AND, UH... THE ANSWER WOULD BE...

208
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,556
YES.

209
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,457
YES, I WAS.

210
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,462
BUT, SEE, I WANTED IT TO BE THIS PHENOMENAL KISS

211
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:26,265
THAT HAPPENED AT THIS PHENOMENAL MOMENT

212
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,668
BECAUSE, WELL, BECAUSE IT'S YOU.

213
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,269
SURE. YEAH.

214
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,371
RIGHT, BUT, YOU SEE, THE LONGER I WAITED

215
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,373
THE MORE PHENOMENAL THE KISS HAD TO BE

216
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,375
AND NOW WE'VE REACHED A PLACE WHERE IT'S

217
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:37,677
GOT TO BE ONE OF THOSE THINGS

218
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,079
WHERE I JUST, LIKE, SWEEP EVERYTHING OFF THE TABLE

219
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,280
AND THROW YOU DOWN ON IT

220
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,082
AND I'M NOT REALLY A, UH...

221
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,984
SWEEPING SORT OF FELLOW.

222
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:49,388
DAVID, I THINK YOU ARE A SWEEPING SORT OF FELLOW.

223
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,189
I MEAN...

224
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,390
YOU'RE A SWEEPER

225
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,793
TRAPPED INSIDE A PHYSICIST'S BODY.

226
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:54,994
REALLY?

227
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:56,596
OH, YEAH. OH, I'M SURE OF IT.

228
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,797
YOU SHOULD JUST DO IT.

229
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,398
JUST SWEEP AND THROW ME.

230
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,203
NOW, NOW?

231
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,805
OH, YEAH, RIGHT NOW.

232
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,406
OKAY, OKAY.

233
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,612
YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS JUST REALLY EXPENSIVE.

234
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,815
AND I TELL YOU, THIS WAS A GIFT.

235
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,317
YOU'RE KIND OF TIDYING UP.

236
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,820
OKAY. WHAT THE HELL? WHAT THE HELL?

237
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,625
DO YOU WANT ME TO ACTUALLY THROW YOU

238
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,226
OR YOU WANT TO JUST HOP UP?

239
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,928
I CAN HOP.

240
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:44,644
TELL ME SOMETHING.

241
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,446
WHAT DOES THE PHRASE "NO DATE PACT" MEAN TO YOU?

242
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:48,648
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

243
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,650
IT'S JUST THAT CHANDLER HAS SOMEBODY

244
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,851
AND PHOEBE HAS SOMEBODY.

245
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,452
I THOUGHT I'D ASK FUN BOBBY.

246
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,253
FUN BOBBY

247
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,855
YOUR EX BOYFRIEND FUN BOBBY?

248
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:56,255
YEAH.

249
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,456
YOU KNOW MORE THAN

250
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,058
ONE FUN BOBBY?

251
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,060
I HAPPEN TO KNOW A FUN BOB.

252
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,263
OKAY. HERE WE GO.

253
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:07,066
OH, OH, OH, THERE'S NO ROOM FOR MILK.

254
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,273
THERE. NOW THERE IS.

255
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,476
OKAY, SO ON OUR NO DATE EVENING

256
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,879
THREE OF YOU NOW ARE GOING TO HAVE DATES.

257
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,380
UH... FOUR.

258
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,282
FIVE. FIVE.

259
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,085
SORRY. PAOLO'S CATCHING AN EARLIER FLIGHT.

260
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,687
YEAH, AND I MET

261
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,089
THIS REALLY HOT SINGLE MOM AT THE STORE.

262
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,290
WHAT'S AN ELF TO DO?

263
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,894
OKAY, SO I'M GOING TO BE THE ONLY ONE

264
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,296
STANDING THERE ALONE WHEN THE BALL DROPS?

265
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,098
OH, COME ON. WE'LL HAVE A BIG PARTY

266
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,200
AND NO ONE WILL KNOW WHO'S WITH WHO.

267
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,001
YEAH, WELL, I'LL KNOW.

268
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:45,604
THIS IS SO NOT WHAT I NEEDED RIGHT NOW.

269
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:46,806
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

270
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,407
OH, IT'S MARCEL.

271
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,812
HE'S ANGRY WITH ME AGAIN.

272
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,013
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY.

273
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,415
HE KEEPS SHUTTING ME OUT, YOU KNOW?

274
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,417
HE'S WALKING AROUND ALL THE TIME

275
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,618
DRAGGING HIS HANDS.

276
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,220
THAT'S SO WEIRD.

277
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,822
I HAD SUCH A BLAST WITH HIM THE OTHER NIGHT.

278
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,123
REALLY?

279
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,725
YEAH. WE PLAYED. WE WATCHED TV.

280
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,727
THAT JUGGLING THING IS AMAZING.

281
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:13,332
WHAT, UH... WHAT JUGGLING THING?

282
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,934
WITH THE BALLED UP SOCKS.

283
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,135
I FIGURED YOU

284
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,336
TAUGHT HIM THAT.

285
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,938
NO.

286
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,940
YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T THAT BIG A DEAL.

287
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,541
IT WAS JUST BALLED UP SOCKS...

288
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,143
AND A MELON.

289
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:28,748
PHOEBE, HI.

290
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,949
HI, MAX.

291
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,150
DO YOU KNOW EVERYBODY?

292
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,152
NO. HAVE YOU SEEN DAVID?

293
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,654
NO. NO. HE HASN'T BEEN AROUND.

294
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,057
WELL, IF YOU SEE HIM, TELL HIM TO PACK HIS BAGS.

295
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:39,658
WE ARE GOING TO MINSK.

296
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,260
MINSK?

297
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,962
MINSK. IT'S IN RUSSIA.

298
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:46,065
I KNOW WHERE MINSK IS.

299
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,867
WE GOT THE GRANT.

300
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,068
THREE YEARS.

301
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,470
ALL EXPENSES PAID.

302
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,172
AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO MINSK

303
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,174
YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GO.

304
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,976
SO WHEN, WHEN DO YOU LEAVE?

305
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,277
JANUARY FIRST.

306
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:06,986
HELLO?

307
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,587
WHAT... HEY!

308
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:09,388
HI.

309
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,791
HI. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

310
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,793
WELL, MAX TOLD ME ABOUT MINSK

311
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,795
SO, YOU KNOW, CONGRATULATIONS!

312
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,597
THIS IS SO EXCITING.

313
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,500
IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE EXCITING IF WE WERE GOING.

314
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,502
YOU'RE NOT GOING?

315
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,504
OH... WHY?

316
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,106
TELL HER, DAVID.

317
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,507
"I DON'T WANT TO GO TO MINSK

318
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,209
"TO WORK WITH LIFSON AND YAMAGUCHI AND FLENCK.

319
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,811
"OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

320
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,313
I WANT TO STAY HERE AND MAKE OUT WITH MY GIRLFRIEND."

321
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,715
OKAY, THANK YOU, MAX.

322
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,317
THANK YOU.

323
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,719
SO... SO YOU'RE REALLY NOT GOING?

324
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:41,921
I DON'T KNOW.

325
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:45,124
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. I JUST...

326
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,325
HOW CAN I LEAVE YOU?

327
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,927
I JUST... FOUND YOU.

328
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,528
OH, DAVID.

329
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,530
OKAY, BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

330
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,933
I DON'T KNOW.

331
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,335
YOU DECIDE.

332
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,236
OH, DON'T DO THAT.

333
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:57,837
PLEASE? OH, NO, NO.

334
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,338
I'M ASKING... I CAN'T.

335
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,040
BUT I CAN'T MAKE THE DECISION.

336
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,142
OKAY, STAY.

337
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,945
STAY?

338
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:06,745
STAY.

339
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,956
YOU'RE GETTING SO GOOD AT THAT.

340
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,960
IT WAS MAX'S STUFF.

341
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,569
I LOVE THIS ARTICHOKE THING.

342
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,972
DON'T TELL ME WHAT'S IN IT.

343
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,974
THE DIET STARTS TOMORROW.

344
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,976

345
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,179
YOU REMEMBER JANICE?

346
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,982
OH... VIVIDLY.

347
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,384
HOW ARE YOU?

348
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:50,189
OH, I AM FANTASTIC DOT NOW.

349
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,892
YOU KNOW WHAT'S TOTALLY AMAZING?

350
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,894
IT'S JUST LIKE WE'VE BEEN BACK TOGETHER

351
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,896
FOR, LIKE, WHAT? LIKE, TEN MINUTES...

352
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,497
IS THAT ALL?

353
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,800
AT IT'S JUST LIKE WE WERE NEVER APART

354
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,203
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? OF COURSE, WE WERE

355
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,804
BUT... FORGIVE AND FORGET.

356
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,406
WELL... HAH! FORGET.

357
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,108

358
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,116

359
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,118
HI.

360
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,319
HI. I'M SANDY.

361
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,922
SANDY, HI. COME ON IN.

362
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,730

363
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,732
YOU BROUGHT YOUR KIDS.

364
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,534
YEAH. THAT'S OKAY, RIGHT?

365
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,339
PAR TAY.

366
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,542
THAT THING IS NOT COMING IN HERE.

367
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,045
"THAT THING"? THIS IS HOW YOU GREET GUESTS AT A PARTY?

368
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,246
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING:

369
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,248
IF I SHOWED UP WITH MY NEW GIRLFRIEND

370
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,250
SHE WOULDN'T BE WELCOME IN YOUR HOME?

371
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,851
I'M THINKING YOUR NEW GIRLFRIEND

372
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,853
WOULDN'T URINATE ON MY COFFEE TABLE.

373
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,357
HE WAS MORE EMBARRASSED ABOUT THAT THAN ANYONE.

374
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,459
OKAY?

375
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:05,264
AND FOR HIM TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO WALK BACK IN HERE

376
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,865
LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED...

377
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,768
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT!

378
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,370
JUST KEEP HIM AWAY FROM ME.

379
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,973
THANK YOU. COME ON, MARCEL.

380
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,576
WHAT DO YOU SAY YOU AND I DO A LITTLE MINGLING?

381
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:21,780
ALL RIGHT. I'LL, UH... CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER.

382
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,288
OH, MY GOSH!

383
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:32,491
RACHEL, HONEY... ARE YOU OKAY?

384
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,692
WHERE'S PAOLO?

385
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,594
ROME.

386
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,596
JERK MISSED HIS FLIGHT.

387
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,398
AND THEN YOUR FACE EXPLODED?

388
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,002
NO.

389
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:47,006
OKAY. I WAS AT THE AIRPORT GETTING INTO A CAB

390
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,408
WHEN THIS WOMAN--

391
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,211
THIS BLONDE PLANET WITH A POCKETBOOK--

392
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,213
STARTS YELLING AT ME.

393
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,016
SOMETHING ABOUT HOW IT WAS HER CAB FIRST

394
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,018
AND THEN THE NEXT THING I KNOW

395
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,420
SHE JUST STARTS PULLING ME OUT BY MY HAIR.

396
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,223
AND SO I'M BLOWING MY ATTACK WHISTLE THINGY

397
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,826
AND AND THREE MORE CABS SHOW UP

398
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:12,231
SO AS I'M GOING TO GET INTO A CAB, SHE TACKLES ME!

399
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,633
I HIT MY HEAD ON THE CURB

400
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:18,137
AND I CUT MY LIP ON MY WHISTLE.

401
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,340
OH...

402
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,542
EVERYBODY HAVING FUN AT THE PARTY?

403
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,246
ARE PEOPLE EATING MY DIP?

404
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,955
THERE... THAT LOOKS OKAY, DOESN'T IT?

405
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,758
YOU, UM, WENT A LITTLE WIDE ON THE LIPSTICK, THERE.

406
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,360
OH. I DID?

407
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,161
YEAH.

408
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,163
SEE? IT'S HARD FOR ME TO TELL.

409
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,165
I THINK MY EYE'S CLOSING UP.

410
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,366
HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT?

411
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,768

00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:55,774
OKAY. HERE WE GO.

415
00:17:55,774 --> 00:18:00,179
SCREW PAOLO. SCREW THE PSYCHO CAB LADY.

416
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,382
IT'S NEW YEAR'S EVE; LET'S HAVE A GOOD TIME.

417
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,983
YES. OKAY, HERE WE GO.

OKAY, ALL RIGHT. THERE YOU GO.

419
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,987
OH, RIGHT. THIS WAY.

420
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,091
COME ON. HERE YOU GO.

421
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,696
YOU KNOW, WHEN I SAW YOU AT THE STORE LAST WEEK

422
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:20,399
IT WAS PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME

423
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,801
I EVER MENTALLY UNDRESSED AN ELF.

424
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,005
WOW. THAT'S, UH, DIRTY.

425
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,308

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,612
HEY, KIDS.

427
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,215
LOOK AT HIM.

428
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,816
I'M NOT SAYING HE HAS TO SPEND

429
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,418
THE WHOLE EVENING WITH ME

430
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,621
BUT AT LEAST CHECK IN.

431
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,824

00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,357

472
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,032
WHEN I INVITED YOU TO THIS PARTY

473
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,435
I DIDN'T NECESSARILY THINK THAT IT MEANT...

474
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,036
OH... NO!

475
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:41,440
OH, NO.

476
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,442
I'M SORRY YOU MISUNDERSTOOD.

477
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:44,243
OH, MY GOD!

00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,854
OH, WILL YOU GIVE ME THE THING!

481
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,259
HI, MAX.

00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,061
YOKO.

483
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:10,269
I'VE DECIDED TO GO TO MINSK WITHOUT YOU.

484
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,770
WOW!

485
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,172
IT WON'T BE THE SAME

486
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,775
BUT IT WILL STILL BE MINSK.

487
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,777
HAPPY NEW YEAR!

488
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,479
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

489
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,082
YEAH, I'M FINE... I'M FINE.

490
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,789
COME ON.

491
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,092
YOU'RE GOING TO MINSK.

492
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:37,095
N NO, I'M NOT GOING TO MINSK.

493
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,097
OH, YOU ARE SO GOING TO MINSK.

494
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,699
YOU BELONG IN MINSK.

495
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,301
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE JUST BECAUSE OF ME.

496
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,902
YES, I CAN, BECAUSE IF I GO

497
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:47,506
I HAVE TO BREAK UP WITH YOU AND I CAN'T BREAK UP WITH YOU.

498
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,608
OH, YES. YES, YOU CAN.

499
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:54,012
JUST SAY, "PHOEBE, I LOVE YOU, BUT MY WORK IS MY LIFE

500
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,014
AND THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO DO RIGHT NOW."

501
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,016
AND I SAY, "YOUR WORK?! YOUR WORK?!

502
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,318
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?"

503
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,522
AND THEN YOU SAY, "IT'S TEARING ME APART

504
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:04,723
"BUT I HAVE NO CHOICE.

505
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,325
CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?"

506
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,327
AND I SAY, "NO!

507
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,329
NO, I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT!"

508
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,530
UH, OW.

509
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,532
OOH, SORRY.

510
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,934
AND THEN YOU PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND ME...

511
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,536
AND THEN YOU PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND ME.

512
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,739
OH, OH, I'M SORRY.

513
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,742
AND, UM, AND THEN YOU TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME

514
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:24,943
AND YOU'LL NEVER FORGET ME.

515
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:28,146
WELL, I I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU.

516
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:31,350
AND THEN YOU SAY THAT IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT

517
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,553
AND YOU HAVE TO GO BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO START

518
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,356
THE NEW YEAR WITH ME IF YOU CAN'T FINISH IT.

519
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:48,467
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU, YOU SCIENTIST GUY.

520
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,870
Hi, this is Dick Clark, live, in Times Square.

521
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,673
We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti

522
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:55,574
here in Times Square.

523
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,877
It gets bigger and better every year.

524
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,879
THERE YOU GO, KIDS.

525
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:04,983
...AND THEN THE PEACOCK BIT ME.

526
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:07,085
PLEASE KISS ME AT MIDNIGHT.

527
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,689
SHH...

528
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,791

529
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,793
OOH, UH, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU THIS

530
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:16,795
BUT, UH, SHE'S IN MONICA'S BEDROOM

531
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,797

532
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,199

533
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,104
HEY, EVERYBODY, THE BALL IS DROPPING.

534
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,606

535
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,008
THE BALL IS DROPPING!

536
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,313
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.

537
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,516
AND THE MOMENT OF JOY IS UPON US.

538
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,520
LOOKS LIKE THAT NO DATE PACT THING WORKED OUT.

539
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,723
EVERYBODY LOOKS SO HAPPY. I HATE THAT!

540
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,125

544
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,840

545
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,442

546
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:07,846
OH, I DON'T FEEL LIKE KISSING ANYONE TONIGHT.

547
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,848
I CAN'T KISS ANYONE.

548
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,850
SO I'M KISSING EVERYONE?

549
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,452
OH, NO, NO. YOU CAN'T KISS ROSS.

550
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,653
THAT'S YOUR BROTHER.

551
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:15,854
OH, YEAH.

552
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:18,256
PERFECT. PERFECT. SO NOW EVERYBODY'S GETTING KISSED BUT ME.

STOP! STOP! ALL RIGHT.

557
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,264
ALL RIGHT!

558
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,474
I WANTED THIS TO WORK SO MUCH.

559
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:39,077
NOW, I'M STILL IN THERE, YOU KNOW

560
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,880
CHANGING HIS DIAPERS, PICKING HIS FLEAS

561
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,083
AND HE'S JUST PHONING IT IN.

562
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,486
IT'S JUST SO HARD TO ACCEPT THE FACT

563
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,087
THAT SOMETHING YOU LOVE SO MUCH

564
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:51,490
DOESN'T LOVE YOU BACK, YOU KNOW?

565
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,494
I THINK THAT BITCH CRACKED MY TOOTH.
