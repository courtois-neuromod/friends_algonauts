2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,407
OH, LOOK! LOOK, LOOK! THERE'S JOEY'S PICTURE.

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,009
THIS IS SO EXCITING.

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,210
YOU CAN ALWAYS SPOT SOMEONE

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,413
WHO'S NEVER SEEN ONE OF HIS PLAYS BEFORE.

6
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:16,216
NOTICE-- NO FEAR, NO SENSE OF IMPENDING DOOM.

7
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,618
LOOK-- "THE ROLE OF MAN #3

8
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:21,421
WILL NOT BE PLAYED BY VIC SHAPIRO."

9
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,624
WELL, WE CAME ON THE WRONG NIGHT.

10
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:27,427
I CAN'T BELIEVE I FORGOT TO BRING A MAGAZINE.

11
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:30,230
COME ON, YOU GUYS. THIS MIGHT BE GOOD.

12
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,431
I DON'T KNOW.

13
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:34,234
THE EXCLAMATION POINT IN THE TITLE SCARES ME.

14
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,636
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT JUST FREUD; IT'S FREUD!

15
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,639
SHH. THE MAGIC IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

16
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,042
WELL, EVA

17
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:46,146
WE'VE DONE SOME EXCELLENT WORK HERE

18
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,948
AND I WOULD HAVE TO SAY

19
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:52,952
YOUR PROBLEM IS QUITE CLEAR.

41
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,243
I FEEL VIOLATED.

42
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,446
DID ANYONE ELSE FEEL LIKE THEY JUST WANTED

43
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,047
TO PEEL THE SKIN OFF THEIR BODY

44
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:31,351
TO HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO DO?

45
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,353
ROSS, 10:00.

46
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,554
IS IT? FEELS LIKE 2:00.

47
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,757
NO, 10:00.

48
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,759
WHAT?

49
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,962
THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AT 8:00, 9:00, 10:00.

50
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,167
 OH. HELLO.

51
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,067
SHE'S AMAZING!

52
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,069
SHE MAKES THE WOMEN I DREAM ABOUT

53
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,071
LOOK LIKE SHORT, FAT, BALD MEN.

54
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,573
WELL, GO OVER TO HER.

55
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,175
SHE'S NOT WITH ANYONE.

56
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,277
OH... YEAH, RIGHT. AND WHAT WOULD MY OPENING LINE BE?

57
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,878
"EXCUSE ME...

58
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,079

59
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,881
COME ON, SHE'S A PERSON.

60
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,483
YOU CAN DO IT.

61
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,885
OH, PLEASE. COULD SHE BE MORE OUT OF MY LEAGUE?

62
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,086
ROSS, BACK ME UP HERE.

63
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,290
HE COULD NEVER GET A WOMAN LIKE THAT IN A MILLION YEARS.

64
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,891
THANK YOU, BUDDY.

65
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:15,295
YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS SEE THESE REALLY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN

66
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,297
WITH THESE REALLY NOTHING GUYS.

67
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,499
YOU COULD BE ONE OF THOSE GUYS.

68
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,700
YOU COULD DO THAT. YOU THINK?

69
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,702
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.

70
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,704
OH, GOD. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M EVEN CONSIDERING THIS.

71
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,306
I'M VERY, VERY AWARE OF MY TONGUE.

72
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,106
COME ON, COME ON.

73
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,608
YES.

74
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,211
STAND BACK, EVERYONE.

75
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,412
INCOMING EGO SHRAPNEL.

76
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,514
ALL RIGHT, I CAN DO THIS.

77
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,119
YES?

78
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,721
HI.

79
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,124
UM... OKAY, NEXT WORD WOULD BE...

80
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,326
UH, CHANDLER...

81
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,128
CHANDLER IS MY NAME.

82
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,531
AND UH... UH... HI.

83
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,134
YES, YOU SAID THAT.

84
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,736
YES... YES, I DID.

85
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,738
BUT WHAT I DIDN'T SAY...

86
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,840
WHAT I WANTED TO SAY WAS

87
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,142
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO OUT WITH ME SOMETIME?

88
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,744
THANK YOU. GOOD NIGHT.

89
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,346
CHANDLER...

90
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,350
HEY! I DIDN'T KNOW

91
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,352
YOU COULD DANCE. YOU WERE IN A PLAY!

92
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,753
WHAT DID YOU THINK?

93
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,556
YOU WERE IN A PLAY!

94
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,558
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD DANCE.

95
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,260
COME ON, YOU GUYS. IT WASN'T THAT BAD.

96
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,861
I WAS THE LEAD. IT WAS BETTER

97
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,463
THAN THAT THING I DID WITH THE TROLLS.

98
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,064
AT LEAST YOU GOT TO SEE MY HEAD.

99
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,566
YOU'RE RIGHT.

100
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,167
SAW YOUR HEAD. SAW YOUR HEAD.

101
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,970
AND HEY, HEY-- HOW ABOUT THAT GERMAN ACCENT?

102
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,573
OH, YA, YA.

103
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,975
ALL OF YOUR Ws WERE Vs.

104
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,678
SHE SAID YES! SHE SAID YES!

105
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:39,879
GREAT!

106
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,881
AWFUL PLAY, MAN.

107
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,483
WHOA!

108
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,686
HER NAME'S AURORA AND SHE'S ITALIAN

109
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,688
AND SHE PRONOUNCES MY NAME "CHAND LER."

110
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,290
"CHAND LER."

111
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,191
I THINK I LIKE IT BETTER THAT WAY.

112
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,694
OH, LISTEN-- THE USHER GAVE ME THIS TO GIVE TO YOU.

113
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,496
"THE ESTELLE LEONARD TALENT AGENCY."

114
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,498
WOW! AN AGENCY LEFT ME ITS CARD.

115
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,500
MAYBE THEY WANT TO SIGN ME.

116
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,801
BASED ON THIS PLAY?

117
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,406
BASED ON THIS PLAY.

118
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,407
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK--

119
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,008
THERE'S A NOTE ON THE BACK.

120
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,209
"LOVED YOUR WORK.

121
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,411
CALL ME A SAP."

122
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,616
SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY MOVED.

123
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,519
AND YOU SHOULD PROBABLY CALL HER FAIRLY QUICKLY.

124
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,020
YEAH, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

125
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,624

126
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,825
 COME IN.

127
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:30,630
HI. UM, I'M HERE TO SEE ESTELLE LEONARD.

128
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,831
JUST A MOMENT.

129
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,433
LET ME SEE IF SHE'S IN.

130
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,235
HELLO.

00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,439

00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,241
I KNOW, I KNOW, YOU WEREN'T EXPECTING

133
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,044

134
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,348
SO... LOVE LUMP...

135
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,949
TAKE A LOAD OFF ALREADY, DARLING.

136
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,451
SIT. SIT, ALREADY.

137
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,253
MISS LEONARD, I CAN'T TELL YOU

138
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,255
HOW EXCITED I AM JUST TO EVEN BE HERE.

139
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,256
WHY NOT?

140
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,059
WELL, WHAT I MEANT WAS...

141
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,061
YOU DON'T MIND IF I EAT WHILE WE TALK, DO YOU?

142
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,262
NO, NO.

143
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,872
SO, JOEY, SWEETHEART, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

144
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:17,276
DID YOU EVER SEE THE MOVIE SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE?

145
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,278
YEAH. WOW. DO YOU REPRESENT THOSE ACTORS?

146
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,480
NO.

147
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,482
BUT YOU KNOW, AT THE END OF THE MOVIE

148
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,685
THE PART WHERE THEY'RE ALL SO HAPPY WITH EACH OTHER?

149
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,286
THAT'S GOING TO BE YOU AND ME.

150
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,689
WOW. YOU MEAN YOU WANT TO SIGN ME?

151
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,691
NO. I WANT TO GO UP ON TOP

152
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,494
OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING AND MAKE OUT.

153
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,498
OF COURSE I WANT TO SIGN YOU!

154
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,699
OH, MISS LEONARD, I'M SO...

155
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,300
OH, GOD!

156
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,502
WHOA! RIDE THEM, COWBOY!

157
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,703
I'M SORRY.

158
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,805
OH, GOD...

159
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,618
I DON'T SEE IT. I DON'T SEE IT.

160
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,219
TRY TO LOOKPAST THE BOOK.

161
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,622
YEAH, YOU JUST HAVE TO UNFOCUS YOUR EYES.

162
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,823
WHO'S FOCUSING?

163
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,825
THERE'S NOTHING TO FOCUS ON.

164
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,927
OH, IT'S THE STATUE OF LIBERTY! RIGHT!

165
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,028
WHAT?!

166
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,831
WHERE'S THE STATUE OF LIBERTY? WHERE?

167
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,032
RIGHT THERE.

168
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,034
GOD, I CAN'T NOT SEE IT NOW.

169
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,737
HEY, KIDS.

170
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,739
CHANDLER, COME HERE. DO YOU SEE ANYTHING RIGHT HERE?

171
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,741
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE A BOAT.

172
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,143
"A BOAT." HA.

173
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,545
YEAH, RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF THE STATUE OF LIBERTY.

174
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,648

175
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,650
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE BEEN HERE ALMOST SEVEN SECONDS

176
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,251
AND YOU HAVEN'T ASKED HOW MY DATE WENT.

177
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,855
HOW WAS YOUR DATE, CHAND LER?

178
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,056
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

179
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,058
I'VE NEVER MET ANYONE LIKE HER.

180
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,060
SHE'S HAD THE MOST AMAZING LIFE.

181
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,062
SHE WAS IN THE ISRAELI ARMY...

182
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:46,265
LUCKILY, NONE OF THE BULLETS HIT THE ENGINE BLOCK.

183
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,867
SO, WE MADE IT TO THE BORDER

184
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,969
BUT JUST BARELY, AND I...

185
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,772
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MYSELF ALL NIGHT LONG.

186
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:53,973
I'M SORRY.

187
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,575
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

188
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,577
TELL ME ONE OF YOUR STORIES.

189
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,178
ALL RIGHT, ONCE...

190
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,981
ONCE I GOT ON THE SUBWAY, RIGHT?

191
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,983
AND IT WAS AT NIGHT

192
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,786
AND I RODE IT ALL THE WAY TO BROOKLYN

193
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,188
JUST FOR THE HELL OF IT.

194
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,791
WE TALKED TILL, LIKE, 2:00.

195
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,392
IT WAS THIS PERFECT EVENING...

196
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,795
MORE OR LESS.

197
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,997
ALL OF SUDDEN, WE REALIZE WE'RE IN YEMEN.

198
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,099
I'M SORRY. SOWEIS?

199
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,502
WE WOULD BE ME AND RICK.

200
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,302
WHO'S RICK?

201
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:24,904
WHO'S RICK?

202
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,306
MY HUSBAND.

203
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,407
EW! EW! EW!

204
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,310
OH, SO YOU'RE DIVORCED?

205
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:31,911
NO.

206
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,313
OH, I'M SORRY.

207
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,315
SO YOU'RE WIDOWED... HOPEFULLY?

208
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:39,118
NO. I'M STILL MARRIED.

209
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,120
SO, TELL ME, HOW DO YOU THINK

210
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,724
YOUR HUSBAND WOULD FEEL ABOUT YOU SITTING HERE WITH ME

211
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,527
SLIDING YOUR FOOT SO FAR UP MY PANT LEG

212
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,529
YOU CAN COUNT THE CHANGE

213
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,931
IN MY POCKET?

214
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,533
DON'T WORRY. I IMAGINE

215
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,734
HE'D BE OKAY WITH YOU

216
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,736
BECAUSE REALLY HE'S OKAY

217
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:57,937
WITH ETHAN.

218
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,138
ETHAN?

219
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,740
THERE'S AN ETHAN?

220
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,142
MM... ETHAN IS MY...

221
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,144
BOYFRIEND.

222
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,345
 WHAT?!

223
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,447
SO, EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO ME, HERE.

224
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,250
WHAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP DO YOU IMAGINE US HAVING

225
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,453
IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A HUSBAND AND A BOYFRIEND?

226
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,557
I SUPPOSE MAINLY SEXUAL.

227
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:21,160
HUH.

228
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,162
I'M SORRY IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

229
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,564
WHAT NOT WORK OUT?

230
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,566
I'M SEEING HER AGAIN ON THURSDAY.

231
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,568
DIDN'T YOU LISTEN TO THE STORY?

232
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,570
DIDN'T YOU LISTEN TO THE STORY?

233
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,171
THIS IS TWISTED.

234
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:35,374
HOW COULD YOU GET INVOLVED WITH A WOMAN LIKE THIS?

235
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,076
I HAD SOME TROUBLE WITH IT AT FIRST, TOO

236
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,078
BUT THE WAY I LOOK AT IT, I GET ALL THE GOOD STUFF.

237
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,381
ALL THE FUN, ALL THE TALKING, ALL THE SEX

238
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,784
AND NONE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY.

239
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,987
THIS IS EVERY GUY'S FANTASY.

240
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,689
OH, YEAH, THAT IS NOT TRUE.

241
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,691
ROSS, IS THIS YOUR FANTASY?

242
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,693
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

243
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,896
YEAH. YEAH, IT IS.

244
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,699
SO YOU GUYS DON'T MIND GOING OUT WITH SOMEONE ELSE

245
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,300
WHO'S GOING OUT WITH SOMEONE ELSE?

246
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,902
I COULDN'T DO IT.

247
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:03,903
GOOD FOR YOU, JOEY.

248
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,106
WHEN I'M WITH A WOMAN, I NEED TO KNOW THAT I'M GOING OUT

249
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,108
WITH MORE PEOPLE THAN SHE IS.

250
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,611
YOU KNOW, ONE TIME I WENT OUT WITH A GUY

251
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,212
WHO HAD JUST GOTTEN DIVORCED

252
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,714
AND IT WAS REALLY HARD.

253
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,716
HIS KIDS LIKED ME BETTER THAN HIM.

254
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,017
PHOEBE, WHAT DOES THIS

255
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,019
HAVE TO DO WITH CHANDLER'S THING?

256
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,621
OH. NOTHING.

257
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:26,025
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING ON THAT TOPIC

258
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,627
SO I WENT ANOTHER WAY.

259
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,129
WELL, YOU KNOW

260
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,131
MONOGAMY CAN BE A TRICKY CONCEPT.

261
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,533
I MEAN, ANTHROPOLOGICALLY SPEAKING...

262
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,836

263
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,639
FINE, FINE. ALL RIGHT, NOW YOU'LL NEVER KNOW.

264
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,641
WE'RE KIDDING. GO. TELL US.

265
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,842
 COME ON, ROSS.

266
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,443
ALL RIGHT.

267
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:47,246
THERE'S A THEORY PUT FORTH BY RICHARD LEAKEY...

268
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,848

269
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,456
TA DAH!

270
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:00,259
ARE WE GREETING EACH OTHER THIS WAY NOW

271
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,861
BECAUSE I LIKE THAT.

272
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,162
LOOK. I CLEANED!

273
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,164
I DID THE WINDOWS, I DID THE FLOORS

274
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,365
I EVEN USED ALL THOSE

275
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,566
VACUUM ATTACHMENTS

276
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,568
EXCEPT FOR THAT LITTLE ROUND ONE

277
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:10,770
WITH THE BRISTLES.

278
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,772
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S FOR.

279
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,974
NOBODY KNOWS AND WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO ASK.

280
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,376
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

281
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:18,577
VERY CLEAN.

282
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,179
REALLY, IT LOOKS GREAT.

283
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:27,386
OH, I SEE YOU MOVED THE GREEN OTTOMAN.

284
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,990
UH OH. UH OH. UH OH.

285
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,092
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

286
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,493
I DON'T KNOW.

287
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,896
I THOUGHT IT LOOKED BETTER THERE.

288
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:40,399
AND ALSO IT'S AN EXTRA SEAT AROUND THE COFFEE TABLE.

289
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,802
IT'S INTERESTING.

290
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,605
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST FOR FUN

291
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:51,010
LET'S SEE WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE IN THE OLD SPOT.

292
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,012
JUST TO COMPARE.

293
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,213
LET'S SEE.

294
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,016
HA! WELL, IT LOOKS GOOD THERE, TOO.

295
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,618
LET'S JUST LEAVE IT THERE FOR A WHILE.

296
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,421
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TRIED TO MOVE THE GREEN OTTOMAN.

297
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,423
THANK GOD YOU DIDN'T TRY

298
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,125
AND FAN OUT THE MAGAZINES.

299
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,928
SHE'LL SCRATCH YOUR EYES RIGHT OUT.

300
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,730
GUYS, I AM NOT THAT BAD.

301
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,331
YEAH, YOU ARE, MONICA.

302
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,534
REMEMBER WHEN I LIVED WITH YOU?

303
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,136
YOU WERE LIKE A LITTLE...

304
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,138

305
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,742
THAT IS SO UNFAIR.

306
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,343
OH, COME ON. WHEN WE WERE KIDS

307
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,746
YOURS WAS THE ONLY RAGGEDY ANN DOLL

308
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,748
THAT WASN'T RAGGEDY.

309
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,750
OKAY, SO I'M RESPONSIBLE.

310
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:31,951
I'M ORGANIZED.

311
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,353
BUT, HEY, I CAN BE A KOOK.

312
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,858
ALL RIGHT, YOU MADCAP GAL.

313
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,660
TRY TO IMAGINE THIS.

314
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,262
THE PHONE BILL ARRIVES

315
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,664
BUT YOU DON'T PAY IT RIGHT AWAY.

316
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:46,665
WHY NOT?

317
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,367
BECAUSE YOU'RE A KOOK.

318
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:53,272
INSTEAD, YOU WAIT UNTIL THEY SEND YOU A NOTICE.

319
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,274
I COULD DO THAT.

320
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:59,578
OKAY, OKAY, THEN YOU LET ME GO GROCERY SHOPPING...

321
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,379
NO PROBLEM.

322
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,580
I'M NOT DONE YET.

323
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,182
OH.

324
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:04,884
AND I BUY LAUNDRY DETERGENT

325
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:08,487
BUT IT'S NOT THE ONE WITH THE EASY POUR SPOUT.

326
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,389
WHY WOULD SOMEONE DO THAT?

327
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,294
ONE MIGHT WONDER.

328
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,898
BUT... I WOULD BE FINE WITH THAT.

329
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,099
SOMEONE'S LEFT

330
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,501
A GLASS ON THE COFFEE TABLE. THERE'S NO COASTER.

331
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:23,702
IT'S A COLD DRINK, IT'S A HOT DAY.

332
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,205
LITTLE BEADS OF CONDENSATION ARE INCHING

333
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,808
THEIR WAY CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE SURFACE OF THE WOOD.

334
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,009
STOP IT!

335
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,014
OH, MY GOD.

336
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,615
IT'S TRUE.

337
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:37,416
WHO AM I?

338
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,919
MONICA, YOU'RE MOM.

339
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,220

340
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,025

341
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,427
UH HUH... UH HUH...

342
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,229
 OH, MY GOD!

343
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,430
OKAY.

344
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,032
OKAY, I'LL BE THERE.

345
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:58,237
HUH, THAT WAS MY AGENT.

346
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,741
MY AGENT HAS JUST GOTTEN ME A JOB...

347
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,743
IN THE NEW AL PACINO MOVIE!

348
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,045
WHAT? YOU'RE KIDDING.

349
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,646
THAT'S GREAT!

350
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:08,848
WHAT'S THE PART?

351
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,249
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

352
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,450
AL PACINO!

353
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,853
THIS GUY'S THE REASON I BECAME AN ACTOR.

354
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,054
"I'M OUT OF ORDER?

355
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,655
"YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER.

356
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,058
THIS WHOLE COURTROOM'S OUT OF ORDER."

357
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,460
SERIOUSLY, WHAT'S THE PART?

358
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,962
"JUST WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS OUT

359
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,364
THEY PULL ME BACK IN."

360
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,666
SERIOUSLY, JOEY, WHAT'S THE PART?

361
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,868
UH...

362
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,469

363
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,171
YOU'RE  WHAT?

364
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,376
I'M HIS BUTT DOUBLE, OKAY?

365
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,183
I PLAY AL PACINO'S BUTT.

366
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,286
ALL RIGHT?

367
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,888
HE GOES INTO THE SHOWER

368
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,091
AND THEN I'M HIS BUTT.

369
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,492
OH, MY GOD.

370
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,094
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

371
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,496
THIS IS A REAL MOVIE, AND AL PACINO'S IN IT

372
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:58,697
AND THAT'S BIG.

373
00:14:58,697 --> 00:14:59,698
OH, NO, IT'S TERRIFIC.

374
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,300
IT'S, IT'S... NO, YOU DESERVE THIS.

375
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,801
AFTER YOUR YEARS OF STRUGGLING

376
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:05,004
YOU'VE FINALLY BEEN ABLE TO CRACK YOUR WAY

377
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,906
INTO SHOW BUSINESS.

378
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,409
OKAY, FINE, MAKE JOKES.

379
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,610
I DON'T CARE.

380
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,612
THIS IS A BIG BREAK FOR ME.

381
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,214
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT, IT IS.

382
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,015
YEAH.

383
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,618
SO, YOU GOING TO INVITE US ALL TO THE BIG OPENING?

384
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:24,823

385
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,425
 ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

386
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,027
YEAH?

387
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,230
HERE. I NEED TO BORROW SOME MOISTURIZER.

388
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:31,830
FOR WHAT?

389
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,433
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

390
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,035
TODAY'S THE BIG DAY.

391
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,937
AND YOU GOT TWEEZERS?

392
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,339
I THINK I HAVE A ROGUE HAIR.

393
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,941
OH, GOD. OKAY, GO INTO THE BATHROOM

394
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,142
USE WHATEVER YOU WANT.

395
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,345
JUST DON'T EVER TELL ME WHAT YOU DID IN THERE.

396
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,146
THANK YOU.

397
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,351
WHERE'S JOEY? HIS MOM'S ON THE PHONE.

398
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,953
HE'S IN THE BATHROOM.

399
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,955
I DON'T THINK YOU DON'T WANT TO GO IN THERE.

400
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,556
OH, COME ON. WE'RE ROOMMATES.

401
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,158

402
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,160
MY EYES! MY EYES!

403
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,964
 I WARNED YOU.

404
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,966
WHO IS BEING LOUD?

405
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,167
OH, THAT WOULD BE MONICA.

406
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,768
HEY, LISTEN, CAN I BORROW

407
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:10,669
A COUPLE OF THINGS?

408
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:11,870
AURORA SPENT THE NIGHT.

409
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,472
I REALLY WANT TO MAKE HER BREAKFAST.

410
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,074
OH, YOU GOT THE WHOLE NIGHT, HUH?

411
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,675
YEAH. WELL, I ONLY HAVE 20 MINUTES

412
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:17,876
TILL ETHAN, SO YOU KNOW...

413
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,279
OOH, DO I SENSE A LITTLE BIT OF RESENTMENT?

414
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,880
NO, NO, NO RESENTMENT.

415
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,882
BELIEVE ME, IT'S WORTH IT, OKAY.

416
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,884
YOU KNOW HOW IN A RELATIONSHIP

417
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,086
YOU HAVE THESE KEY MOMENTS

418
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,888
THAT YOU KNOW YOU'LL REMEMBER FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

419
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:33,892
WELL, EVERY... SINGLE... SECOND IS LIKE THAT WITH AURORA.

420
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:37,096
AND I'VE JUST WASTED ABOUT 35 OF THEM TALKING TO YOU PEOPLE.

421
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,799
SO, UH, MONICA, CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THE DOOR?

422
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,001
SURE.

423
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,003
OH, UM, CHANDLER, YOU KNOW

424
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,405
THE OLD MONICA WOULD REMIND YOU

425
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:50,409
TO SCRUB THAT TEFLON PAN WITH A PLASTIC BRUSH.

426
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,411
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT.

427
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,916
UH, EXCUSE ME.

428
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,719
COULD YOU SEE IF THEY COULD WARM IT UP IN HERE?

429
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,122
I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT GOOSE BUMPS.

430
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,723
OKAY, EVERYBODY READY?

431
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:08,927
LISTEN, I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

432
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,429
BUT, I MEAN, LISTEN--

433
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,431
I KNOW THIS IS JUST A FIRST STEP

434
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,433
BUT I HOPE THAT SOMEDAY...

435
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,534
LOSE THE ROBE.

436
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:19,138
RIGHT. OKAY. LOSING THE ROBE.

437
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,341
OKAY. AND THE ROBE IS LOST.

438
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,743
OKAY, EVERYBODY, I'D LIKE TO GET THIS

439
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,345
IN ONE TAKE, PLEASE. LET'S ROLL IT.

440
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:29,948
WATER'S WORKING.

441
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,650
AND... ACTION.

442
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,254
AND... CUT.

443
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:38,657
HEY, BUTT GUY, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

444
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,259
WELL... I'M SHOWERING.

445
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,261
NO. THAT WAS "CLENCHING."

446
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,764
OH. WELL, THE WAY I SEE IT, THE GUY'S UPSET, YOU KNOW?

447
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:49,368
I MEAN, HIS WIFE'S DEAD, HIS BROTHER'S MISSING.

448
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:52,571
I THINK HIS BUTT WOULD BE ANGRY HERE.

449
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,872
I THINK HIS BUTT

450
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:57,576
WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS SHOT BEFORE LUNCH.

451
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:58,877
ONCE AGAIN, ROLLING.

452
00:17:58,877 --> 00:17:59,678
WATER WORKING.

453
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,581
AND... ACTION.

454
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,384
AND... CUT.

455
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,585
WHAT WAS THAT?

456
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:10,089
I WAS GOING FOR QUIET DESPERATION.

457
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:16,095
BUT IF YOU HAVE TO ASK...

458
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,901
GOD, I LOVE THESE FINGERS.

459
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,503
THANK YOU.

460
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,905
NO, ACTUALLY I MEANT MY FINGERS.

461
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,507
LOOK AT THEM.

462
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,509
LOOK HOW HAPPY THEY ARE.

463
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,911
OH... OH, MY GOD, I'M LATE.

464
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,913
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

465
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,515
DON'T GO, DON'T GO.

466
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,716
OKAY, OKAY.

467
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:38,517
DON'T GO, DON'T GO.

468
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,119
NO, I HAVE TO.

469
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,720
LOOK AT THAT-- SHE'S LEAVING.

470
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,923
I'M SORRY. HE'LL BE WAITING FOR ME.

471
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,726
WELL, I THOUGHT YOU TALKED TO RICK.

472
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:48,927
IT'S... NOT RICK.

473
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,330
BUT ETHAN-- HE GOT TO SPEND THE WHOLE DAY WITH YOU.

474
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,332
NO, IT'S... IT'S ANDREW.

475
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:00,839
I KNOW THERE'LL BE MANY MOMENTS IN YEARS TO COME

476
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:04,843
WHEN I'LL REGRET ASKING THE FOLLOWING QUESTION, BUT...

477
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,845
AND ANDREW IS...?

478
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,247
HE'S... NEW.

479
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,848
SO, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

480
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,451
IS YOU'RE NOT COMPLETELY FULFILLED

481
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,453
BY RICK, ETHAN AND MYSELF?

482
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,356
NO, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT...

483
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:21,560
MOST WOMEN WOULD KILL FOR THREE GUYS LIKE US.

484
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,263
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT?

485
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,265
YOU.

486
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,266
YOU HAVE ME.

487
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,467
NO, NO, JUST YOU.

488
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,469
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

489
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,871
LOSE THE OTHER GUYS.

490
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,274
LIKE... ALL OF THEM?

491
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,577
COME ON, WE'RE GREAT TOGETHER!

492
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,179
WHY NOT?

493
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,981
WHY CAN'T WE JUST HAVE WHAT WE HAVE NOW--

494
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,384
WHY CAN'T WE JUST TALK AND LAUGH AND MAKE LOVE

495
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,187
WITHOUT FEELING OBLIGATED TO ONE ANOTHER?

496
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,388
AND UP UNTIL TONIGHT

497
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,191
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED, TOO.

498
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,593
YOU KNOW, PART OF ME WANTS THAT

499
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,396
BUT IT'S LIKE I'M TWO GUYS, YOU KNOW?

500
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,999
I MEAN, ONE GUY'S SAYING, "SHUT UP! THIS IS GREAT!"

501
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,701
BUT THERE'S THIS OTHER GUY--

502
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,103
ACTUALLY IT'S THE GUY WHO WELLS UP

503
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,906
EVERY TIME THE GRINCH'S HEART GROWS THREE SIZES

504
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,309
AND BREAKS THAT MEASURING DEVICE?--

505
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,910
AND HE'S SAYING, YOU KNOW

506
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,313
"THIS IS TOO HARD! GET OUT! GET OUT!"

507
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:18,317
SO, WHICH ONE OF THE TWO GUYS WILL YOU LISTEN TO?

508
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,518
I DON'T KNOW.

509
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,920
I HAVE TO LISTEN TO BOTH OF THEM.

510
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,121
THEY DON'T EXACTLY

511
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,723
LET EACH OTHER FINISH.

512
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,924
WHICH ONE?

513
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,129
THE SECOND GUY.

514
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,932
I SEE.

515
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,534
WELL...

516
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:41,139
CALL ME IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.

517
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:52,351
SORRY. THE FIRST GUY RUNS THE LIPS.

518
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,558

519
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:08,467
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY-- YOU DUMPED HER.

520
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,970
RIGHT? I MEAN, THIS WOMAN WAS UNBELIEVABLY SEXY

521
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:17,175
AND BEAUTIFUL, INTELLIGENT, UNATTAINABLE...

522
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:21,179
TELL ME WHY YOU DID THIS AGAIN?

523
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,982
 HEY.

524
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,484
HEY, MOVIE STAR.

525
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:29,488
HEY, WAIT. AREN'T YOU THE GUY WHO PLAYS THE BUTT

526
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,390
IN THE NEW AL PACINO MOVIE?

527
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,591
NOPE.

528
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,993
NO? WHAT HAPPENED, BIG GUY?

529
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,396
"BIG GUY"?

530
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:42,200
IT FELT LIKE A "BIG GUY" MOMENT.

531
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:43,502
I GOT FIRED.

532
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:44,703
OH...

533
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,905
THEY SAID I "ACTED" TOO MUCH

534
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:49,007
WITH IT.

535
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,209
I TOLD EVERYBODY ABOUT THIS.

536
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,012
NOW EVERYONE IS GOING TO GO TO THE THEATER EXPECTING TO SEE ME...

537
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,415
JOE, YOU KNOW WHAT? NO ONE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO TELL.

538
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,417
MY MOM WILL.

539
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,220
THERE'S SOMETHING SO SWEET...

540
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,424
AND DISTURBING ABOUT THAT.

541
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:09,227
YOU KNOW, I'VE DONE NOTHING BUT CRAPPY PLAYS FOR SIX YEARS

542
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:12,030
AND I FINALLY GET MY SHOT, AND I BLOW IT!

543
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,032
MAYBE THIS WASN'T YOUR SHOT.

544
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:17,235
YEAH. I THINK WHEN IT'S YOUR SHOT

545
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,237
YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW IT'S YOUR SHOT.

546
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:22,441
DID... DID IT FEEL LIKE YOUR SHOT?

547
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,743
HARD TO TELL.

548
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:25,844
I WAS NAKED.

549
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,246
I DON'T THINK THIS WAS YOUR SHOT.

550
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,848
I DON'T EVEN THINK YOU JUST GET ONE SHOT.

551
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,250
I REALLY BELIEVE BIG THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN FOR YOU.

552
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,454
I DO, AND YOU'VE GOT TO JUST KEEP THINKING ABOUT THE DAY

553
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:38,256
THAT SOME KID IS GOING TO RUN UP TO HIS FRIENDS AND GO

554
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:39,858
"I GOT THE PART! I GOT THE PART!

555
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,860
I'M GOING TO BE JOEY TRIBBIANI'S ASS!"

556
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,265
YOU THINK? THAT'S SO NICE!

557
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,369
OH... COME ON.

558
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,172
I'M SORRY, JOEY.

559
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,975
I'M GOING TO GO TO BED, GUYS.

560
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,276
GOOD NIGHT, MONICA.

561
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,679
MON... YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE YOUR SHOES OUT HERE?

562
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,180
OH.

563
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:03,782
UH HUH.

564
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,887
REALLY? JUST CASUALLY STREWN ABOUT

565
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,690
IN THAT RECKLESS, HAPHAZARD MANNER?

566
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,191
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
