15
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,356
THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL.

16
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:59,159
IT'S JUST SOME GUY I WORK WITH.

17
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,660
YOU'RE GOING OUT WITH HIM.

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,463
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM.

19
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,566
ALL RIGHT, JOEY, BE NICE.

20
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,368
SO, DOES HE HAVE A HUMP?

21
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,770
A HUMP AND A HAIRPIECE?

22
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,372
WAIT, DOES HE EAT CHALK?

23
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,473
I DON'T WANT HER

24
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,574
TO GO THROUGH

25
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,976
WHAT I WENT THROUGH WITH CARL.

26
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,778
OKAY, EVERYBODY RELAX.

27
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:21,381
THIS IS NOT A DATE.

28
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,083
IT'S TWO PEOPLE GOING OUT TO DINNER

29
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,085
AND NOT HAVING SEX.

30
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,487
SOUNDS LIKE A DATE TO ME.

31
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,891
SO I'M BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL.

32
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,493
I'M STANDING IN THE MIDDLE

33
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:34,394
OF THE CAFETERIA

34
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,796
AND I REALIZE I AM TOTALLY... NAKED.

35
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,998
I'VE HAD THAT DREAM.

36
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:40,500
THEN, I LOOK DOWN

37
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,703
AND I REALIZE THERE IS A PHONE...

38
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:44,904
THERE.

39
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,308
INSTEAD OF..?

40
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:49,509
THAT'S RIGHT.

41
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,411
NEVER HAD THAT DREAM.

42
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,413
ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE PHONE

43
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,514
STARTS TO RING.

44
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,916
NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

45
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,319
EVERYBODY STARTS LOOKING AT ME.

46
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,321
THEY WEREN'T LOOKING AT YOU BEFORE?

47
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:06,526
FINALLY I FIGURE I'D BETTER ANSWER IT

48
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,928
AND IT TURNS OUT IT'S MY MOTHER

49
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,133
WHICH IS VERY, VERY WEIRD BECAUSE...

50
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,135
SHE NEVER CALLS ME.

51
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,641
HI.

52
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:28,047
THIS GUY SAYS "HELLO, I WANT TO KILL MYSELF."

53
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,349
ARE YOU OKAY, SWEETIE?

54
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,751
I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE REACHED DOWN MY THROAT

55
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,554
GRABBED MY SMALL INTESTINE, PULLED IT OUT OF MY MOUTH

56
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,156
AND TIED IT AROUND MY NECK.

57
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,757
COOKIE?

58
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,961
CAROL MOVED HER STUFF OUT TODAY.

59
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:42,962
 OH...

60
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,564
LET ME GET YOU SOME COFFEE.

61
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,166
THANKS.

62
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,369
OOH. UGH...

63
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,371
NO. OH, NO. NO, DON'T.

64
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,773
STOP CLEANSING MY AURA.

65
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:54,574
NO, JUST

66
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,676
LEAVE MY AURA ALONE, OKAY?

67
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,879
FINE. BE MURKY.

68
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,681
I'LL BE FINE, ALL RIGHT?

69
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,683
I HOPE SHE'LL BE VERY HAPPY.

70
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,584
 NO, YOU DON'T.

71
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,586
TO HELL WITH HER. SHE LEFT ME.

72
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,389
AND YOU NEVER KNEW SHE WAS A LESBIAN?

73
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,295
NO. OKAY?

74
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:18,498
WHY DOES EVERYONE KEEP FIXATING ON THAT?

75
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,701
SHE DIDN'T KNOW.

76
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,703
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

77
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,806
SOMETIMES I WISH I WAS A LESBIAN.

78
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,010
DID I SAY THAT OUT LOUD?

79
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,014
I TOLD MOM AND DAD LAST NIGHT.

80
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,817
THEY SEEMED TO TAKE IT PRETTY WELL.

81
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,018
OH, REALLY?

82
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,620
SO, THAT HYSTERICAL PHONE CALL

83
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,022
I GOT FROM A WOMAN SOBBING AT 3 A.M.--

84
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:46,226
"I'LL NEVER HAVE GRANDCHILDREN, I'LL NEVER HAVE GRANDCHILDREN"

85
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,827
WAS, WHAT, A WRONG NUMBER?

86
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,429
SORRY.

87
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,530
ALL RIGHT, ROSS, LOOK

88
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,532
YOU'RE FEELING A LOT OF PAIN RIGHT NOW.

89
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,133
YOU'RE ANGRY. YOU'RE HURTING.

90
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,536
CAN I TELL YOU WHAT THE ANSWER IS?

91
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,439
STRIP JOINTS!

92
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,542
OH, COME ON.

93
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,343
YOU'RE SINGLE.

94
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,944
HAVE SOME HORMONES.

95
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,247
SEE, BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE SINGLE, OKAY?

96
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,450
I JUST, I JUST, I JUST WANT TO BE MARRIED AGAIN.

97
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,457
AND I JUST WANT A MILLION DOLLARS.

98
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,363
RACHEL?

99
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,964
OH, GOD, MONICA, HI. THANK GOD.

100
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,566
I JUST WENT TO YOUR BUILDING

101
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:27,767
AND YOU WEREN'T THERE

102
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,769
AND THEN THIS GUY WITH A BIG HAMMER

103
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,572
SAID THAT YOU MIGHT BE HERE, AND YOU ARE, YOU ARE.

104
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:33,973
CAN I GET YOU SOME COFFEE?

105
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,475
DECAF.

106
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,278
OKAY, EVERYBODY, THIS IS RACHEL

107
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,879
ANOTHER LINCOLN HIGH SURVIVOR.

108
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,080
THIS IS EVERYBODY.

109
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,881
THIS IS CHANDLER

110
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,483
AND PHOEBE, AND JOEY

111
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,884
AND YOU REMEMBER

112
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:45,785
MY BROTHER ROSS?

113
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,986
SURE.

114
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,588
HI. OH!

115
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,197
SO, YOU WANT TO TELL US NOW

116
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:00,600
OR ARE WE WAITING FOR FOUR WET BRIDESMAIDS?

117
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,602
OH, GOD. WELL, IT STARTED

118
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,405
ABOUT A HALF HOUR BEFORE THE WEDDING.

119
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,606
I WAS IN THIS ROOM

120
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,809
WHERE WE WERE KEEPING ALL THE PRESENTS

121
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,612
AND I WAS LOOKING AT THIS GRAVY BOAT--

122
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,815
THIS REALLY GORGEOUS LIMOGES GRAVY BOAT--

123
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,217
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I REALIZED...

124
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,419
SWEET AND LOW?

125
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,821
I REALIZED THAT I WAS MORE TURNED ON

126
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,223
BY THIS GRAVY BOAT THAN BY BARRY

127
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,225
AND THEN I GOT REALLY FREAKED OUT

128
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:29,028
AND THAT'S WHEN IT HIT ME

129
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:32,632
HOW MUCH BARRY LOOKS LIKE MR. POTATO HEAD.

130
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,735
I MEAN, I ALWAYS KNEW HE LOOKED FAMILIAR, BUT...

131
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,139
ANYWAY, I JUST HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE

132
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,942
AND I STARTED WONDERING, "WHY AM I DOING THIS

133
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,944
AND WHO AM I DOING THIS FOR?"

134
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:48,147
SO, ANYWAY, I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO

135
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,550
AND I KNOW THAT YOU AND I HAVE DRIFTED APART

136
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,151
BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON I KNEW

137
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,353
WHO LIVED IN THE CITY.

138
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,355
WHO WASN'T INVITED TO THE WEDDING.

139
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,458
OH, I WAS KIND OF HOPING THAT WOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE.

140
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:10,470

141
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,773
Embarazada de Marcela...

142
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,375
 I'M GUESSING

143
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,176
THAT HE BOUGHT HER THE BIG PIPE ORGAN

144
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,778
AND SHE'S REALLY NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.

145
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,181
TUNA OR EGG SALAD--

146
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:23,683
DECIDE!

147
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,285
I'LL HAVE

148
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:27,787
WHATEVER CHRISTINE IS HAVING.

149
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,391
DADDY, I JUST...

150
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,393
I CAN'T MARRY HIM.

151
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,894
I'M SORRY.

152
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,697
I JUST DON'T LOVE HIM.

153
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:41,300
WELL, IT MATTERS TOME.

154
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:46,305
IF I LET GO OF MY HAIR

155
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,808
MY HEAD WILL FALL OFF.

156
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,613
 OOH, SHE SHOULD NOT BE WEARING THOSE PANTS.

157
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,516
I SAY PUSH HER DOWN THE STAIRS.

158
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,418
 PUSH HER DOWN THE STAIRS!

159
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,019
PUSH HER DOWN

160
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,421
THE STAIRS!

161
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,922
ALL RIGHT!

162
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,926
COME ON, DADDY, LISTEN TO ME.

163
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,127
ALL OF MY LIFE

164
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:11,330
EVERYONE HAS ALWAYS TOLD ME, "YOU'RE A SHOE.

165
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,532
"YOU'RE A SHOE.

166
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,133
YOU'RE A SHOE. YOU'RE A SHOE."

167
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,936
AND THEN TODAY JUST STOPPED AND SAID

168
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,338
"WHAT IF I DON'T WANT TO BE A SHOE?

169
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,340
"WHAT IF I WANT TO BE A PURSE?

170
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,542
OR A HAT?"

171
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,944
NO, I DON'T WANT YOU TO BUY ME A HAT.

172
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,946
I'M SAYING THAT I AM A HAT...

173
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,948
IT'S A METAPHOR, DADDY!

174
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,552
YOU CAN SEE WHERE HE'D HAVE TROUBLE.

175
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,557
LOOK, DADDY, IT'S MY LIFE.

176
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:41,461
WELL, MAYBE I'LL JUST STAY HERE WITH MONICA.

177
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:46,966
WELL, I GUESS WE'VE ESTABLISHED SHE'S STAYING HERE WITH MONICA.

178
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,970
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S MY DECISION.

179
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,372
WELL, MAYBE I DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY.

180
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:56,175
 WAIT, WAIT! I SAID MAYBE!

181
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:07,487
OKAY, JUST BREATHE. THAT'S IT.

182
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,289
JUST TRY TO THINK OF NICE, CALM THINGS.

183
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,291
? RAINDROPS ON ROSES ?

184
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,293
? AND WHISKERS ON KITTENS ?

185
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,696
? DOORBELLS AND SLEIGH BELLS ?

186
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,698
? AND SOMETHING WITH MITTENS ?

187
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,100
? LA LA LA SOMETHING ?

188
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,301
? AND NOODLES WITH STRING ?

189
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,903
? THESE ARE A... ?

190
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,706
I'M ALL BETTER NOW. THANK YOU.

191
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,808
I HELPED.

192
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,412
OKAY, LOOK, THIS IS PROBABLY FOR THE BEST.

193
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,614
INDEPENDENCE...

194
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,016
TAKING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE.

195
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,018
THE WHOLE... HAT THING.

196
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,520
AND HEY, YOU NEED ANYTHING

197
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,121
YOU CAN ALWAYS COME TO JOEY.

198
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,123
ME AND CHANDLER

199
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:47,226
LIVE RIGHT ACROSS THE HALL

200
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,628
AND HE'S AWAY A LOT.

201
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,829
STOP HITTING ON HER.

202
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,430
IT'S HER WEDDING DAY.

203
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,833
LIKE THERE'S A RULE OR SOMETHING?

204
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,236

205
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,538
I GOT IT.

206
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,741
PLEASE DON'T DO THAT AGAIN.

207
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,942
IT'S A HORRIBLE SOUND.

208
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,944
Uh, it's-- it's Paul.

209
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,346
OH, GOD, IS IT 6:30?

210
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,948
BUZZ HIM IN.

211
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:09,749
WHO'S PAUL?

212
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,751
"PAUL THE WINE GUY" PAUL?

213
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:12,552
MAYBE.

214
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,554
YOUR "NOT A REAL DATE" TONIGHT

215
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,155
IS WITH "PAUL THE WINE GUY"?

216
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,757
HE FINALLY ASKED YOU OUT?

217
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:18,958
YES.

218
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,259
A "DEAR DIARY" MOMENT.

219
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,062
RACH, WAIT. I CAN CANCEL.

220
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,865
PLEASE, NO, GO. I'LL BE FINE.

221
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,767
ROSS, ARE YOU OKAY?

222
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,670
I MEAN, DO YOU WANT ME TO STAY?

223
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,871
THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

224
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,674
REALLY?

225
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:35,775
NO! GO ON!

226
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,177
IT'S "PAUL THE WINE GUY"!

227
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,579
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

228
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,180
DOES HE SELL IT, DRINK IT

229
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,782
OR HE JUST COMPLAINS A LOT?

230
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,284
HI. COME IN.

231
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,886
PAUL, THIS IS...

232
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,187
EVERYBODY.

233
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,189
EVERYBODY, THIS IS PAUL.

234
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,591
 "PAUL THE WINE GUY"!

235
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,893
I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR NAME.

236
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,494
PAUL, WAS IT?

237
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,496
OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

238
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,498
I'VE JUST GOT TO GO, UH...

239
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,299
GO, UH...

240
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,001
A WANDERING?

241
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,103
CHANGE.

242
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,304
OKAY, SIT DOWN.

243
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,906
TWO SECONDS.

244
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,111
I JUST PULLED OUT FOUR EYELASHES.

245
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,713
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

246
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,919
HEY, PAUL.

247
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,520
HERE'S A LITTLE TIP.

248
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,722
SHE REALLY LIKES IT

249
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,724
WHEN YOU RUB HER NECK IN THE SAME SPOT

250
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,325
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN

251
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,327
TILL IT STARTS TO GET A LITTLE RED.

252
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,230
 SHUT UP, JOEY!

253
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,635
SO, RACHEL, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO TONIGHT?

254
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,638
I WAS KIND OF SUPPOSED TO BE HEADED FOR ARUBA

255
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,239
ON MY HONEYMOON.

256
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,440
SO NOTHING.

257
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:46,145
RIGHT. YOU'RE NOT EVEN GETTING YOUR HONEYMOON.

258
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,146
GOD...

259
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,048
NO... ARUBA.

260
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:52,652
THIS TIME OF YEAR, TALK ABOUT YOUR...

261
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,253
BIG LIZARDS.

262
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:01,861
ANYWAY, IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE BEING ALONE TONIGHT

263
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,864
JOEY AND CHANDLER ARE HELPING ME PUT TOGETHER

264
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,065
MY NEW FURNITURE.

265
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,067
AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT.

266
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:11,270
THANKS, BUT I'M GOING TO HANG OUT HERE TONIGHT.

267
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,471
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

268
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,673
OH, SURE. OKAY, SURE.

269
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,274
PHEEBS, YOU WANT TO HELP?

270
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,677
I WISH I COULD, BUT I DON'T WANT TO.

271
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,489
? LOVE IS SWEET AS SUMMER SHOWERS ?

272
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,693
? LOVE IS A WONDROUS WORK OF ART ?

273
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:39,799
? BUT YOUR LOVE, OH, YOUR LOVE, YOUR LOVE... ?

274
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,803
? IS LIKE A GIANT PIGEON... ?

275
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:47,006
? CRAPPING ON MY HEART ?

276
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,809
? LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA... ?

277
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,410
THANK YOU!

278
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:56,215
? LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA ?

279
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,018
? OOH... ?

280
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,421
I'M SUPPOSED TO ATTACH

281
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,524
A BRACKETY THING TO THE SIDE THINGS

282
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:08,728
USING A BUNCH OF THESE LITTLE WORM GUYS.

283
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,931
I HAVE NO BRACKETY THING.

284
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:15,534
I SEE NO WORM GUYS WHATSOEVER.

285
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,536
AND I CANNOT FEEL MY LEGS.

286
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,741
I'M THINKING WE GOT A BOOKCASE HERE.

287
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:22,942
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.

288
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,543
WHAT'S THIS?

289
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,545
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY

290
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:30,149
THAT IT'S AN "L" SHAPED BRACKET.

291
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,952
WHICH GOES WHERE?

292
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,954
I HAVE NO IDEA.

293
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,058
DONE WITH THE BOOKCASE!

294
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,259
ALL FINISHED!

295
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,065
THIS WAS CAROL'S FAVORITE BEER.

296
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,270
SHE ALWAYS DRANK IT OUT OF THE CAN.

297
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,471
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

298
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,673
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

299
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,476
IF YOU'RE GOING TO START WITH THAT STUFF

300
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:58,677
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

301
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,080
PLEASE DON'T SPOIL ALL THIS FUN.

302
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,681
ROSS, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

303
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:06,285
SHE GOT THE FURNITURE, THE STEREO, THE GOOD TV.

304
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,687
WHAT DID YOU GET?

305
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:09,889
YOU GUYS.

306
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,691
YOU GOT SCREWED. OH, MY GOD.

307
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,592
OH, MY GOD.

308
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,194
I KNOW. I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.

309
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,196
I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT ON

310
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,598
WHEN SHE STARTED GOING TO THE DENTIST

311
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,200
FOUR AND FIVE TIMES A WEEK.

312
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,202
I MEAN, HOW CLEAN CAN TEETH GET?

313
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,204
MY BROTHER'S GOING THROUGH THAT NOW.

314
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,806
HE'S SUCH A MESS.

315
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,407
HOW DID YOU GET THROUGH IT?

316
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,209
HE MIGHT TRY ACCIDENTALLY BREAKING

317
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,211
SOMETHING VALUABLE OF HERS--

318
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,412
SAY, HER...

319
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,313
LEG?

320
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,315
THAT'S ONE WAY OF GOING THROUGH IT.

321
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,317
ME, I WENT FOR THE WATCH.

322
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,419
YOU ACTUALLY BROKE HER WATCH?

323
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,822
WOW. THE WORST THING THAT I EVER DID WAS

324
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,025
I SHREDDED MY OLD BOYFRIEND'S FAVORITE BATH TOWEL.

325
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,027
OOH, STEER CLEAR OF YOU.

326
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,029
THAT'S RIGHT.

327
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,131
BARRY, I AM SORRY. I AM SO SORRY.

328
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:53,732
I KNOW YOU PROBABLY THINK

329
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,734
THIS IS ALL ABOUT WHAT I SAID THE OTHER NIGHT

330
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,736
ABOUT YOU MAKING LOVE WITH YOUR SOCKS ON

331
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,338
BUT IT ISN'T.

332
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,740
 IT'S ABOUT ME, AND I DID...

333
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,149
HI. MACHINE CUT ME OFF AGAIN.

334
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,750
ANYWAY...

335
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:18,357
LOOK, I KNOW THAT SOME GIRL IS GOING TO BE

336
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,360
INCREDIBLY LUCKY TO BECOME MRS. BARRY FINKEL

337
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,561
BUT IT ISN'T ME.

338
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:23,762
IT'S NOT ME.

339
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,565
NOT THAT I HAVE ANY IDEA WHO "ME" IS RIGHT NOW

340
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,368
BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO GIVE ME A CHANCE TO...

341
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,970

342
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,173
I'M DIVORCED.

343
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,375
I'M ONLY 26, AND I'M DIVORCED.

344
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,576
SHUT UP.

345
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,979
ROSS, YOU MUST STOP.

346
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,185
THAT ONLY TOOK ME AN HOUR.

347
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,788
ROSS, YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND.

348
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,790
BETWEEN US, WE HAVEN'T HAD A RELATIONSHIP

349
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,392
THAT'S LASTED LONGER THAN A MENTO.

350
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:59,698
YOU, HOWEVER, HAVE HAD THE LOVE OF A WOMAN FOR FOUR YEARS.

351
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,101
FOUR YEARS OF CLOSENESS AND SHARING

352
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,904
AT THE END OF WHICH SHE RIPPED YOUR HEART OUT

353
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,306
AND THAT IS WHY WE DON'T DO IT.

354
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,910
I DON'T THINK THAT WAS MY POINT.

355
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,914
YOU KNOW WHAT THE SCARIEST PART IS?

356
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,316
WHAT IF THERE'S ONLY ONE WOMAN FOR EVERYBODY?

357
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,719
WHAT IF YOU GET ONE WOMAN AND THAT'S IT?

358
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,721
UNFORTUNATELY, IN MY CASE

359
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,925
THERE WAS ONLY ONE WOMAN FOR HER.

360
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,127
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

361
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,930
ONE WOMAN.

362
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,431
THAT'S LIKE SAYING

363
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,334
THERE'S ONLY ONE FLAVOR OF ICE CREAM FOR YOU.

364
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,436
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, ROSS.

365
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,838
THERE'S LOTS OF FLAVORS OUT THERE.

366
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,241
THERE'S ROCKY ROAD AND COOKIE DOUGH

367
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,842
AND BING CHERRY VANILLA.

368
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:46,645
YOU CAN GET THEM WITH JIMMIES OR NUTS

369
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:47,846
OR WHIPPED CREAM.

370
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,848
THIS IS THE BEST THING

371
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,450
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU.

372
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,651
YOU GOT MARRIED.

373
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,653
YOU WERE LIKE, WHAT, EIGHT?

374
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,657
WELCOME BACK TO THE WORLD.

375
00:15:58,657 --> 00:15:59,858
GRAB A SPOON.

376
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:03,462
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW IF I'M HUNGRY OR HORNY.

377
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,464
THEN STAY OUT

378
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,865
OF MY FREEZER.

379
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:12,972
EVER SINCE SHE WALKED OUT ON ME, I...

380
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,073
WHAT?

381
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,276
WHAT, YOU WANT TO SPELL IT OUT WITH NOODLES?

382
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:21,680
NO, IT'S MORE OF A FIFTH DATE KIND OF REVELATION.

383
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,085
OH, SO, THERE'S GOING TO BE A FIFTH DATE?

384
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,087
ISN'T THERE?

385
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:31,290
YEAH, YEAH, I THINK THERE IS.

386
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,893
WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO SAY?

387
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,597
WELL, WELL...

388
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:42,201
EVER SINCE SHE LEFT ME, UM...

389
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,804
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM...

390
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,406
SEXUALLY.

391
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,411
OH, GOD. I'M SO SORRY.

392
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,013
IT'S OKAY.

393
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,214
BEING SPIT ON

394
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,417
IS PROBABLY NOT WHAT YOU NEED RIGHT NOW.

395
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,618
UM...

396
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:00,819
HOW LONG?

397
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,421
TWO YEARS.

398
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,423
WOW.

399
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:08,027
I I I'M GLAD YOU SMASHED HER WATCH.

400
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,829
SO, YOU STILL THINK YOU, UM...

401
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,632
MIGHT WANT THAT FIFTH DATE?

402
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,236
YEAH.

403
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,238
YEAH, I DO.

404
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,242
We are gathered here to join together

405
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,045
Joanie Louise Cunningham

406
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,048
and Charles... Chachi

407
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,850
Chachi, Chachi...

408
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,054
in the bond of holy matrimony.

409
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,456
OOH! SEE?

410
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,858
BUT JOANIE LOVES CHACHI.

411
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,261
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.

412
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,265
GRAB A SPOON.

413
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:50,269
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT'S BEEN SINCE I GRABBED A SPOON?

414
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,072
DO THE WORDS "BILLY, DON'T BE A HERO"

415
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,174
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

416
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,178
GREAT STORY...

417
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,779
BUT I GOT TO GO.

418
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,282
I GOT A DATE WITH ANDREA.

419
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,384
ANGELA. ANDREA.

420
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,585
OH, MAN.

421
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,787
ANDREA'S THE SCREAMER.

422
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:09,988
ANGELA HAS CATS.

423
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,590
THAT'S RIGHT. THANKS.

424
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,592
IT'S JULIE. I'M OUT OF HERE.

425
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,396
YOU KNOW, HERE'S THE THING.

426
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,199
EVEN IF I COULD GET IT TOGETHER ENOUGH

427
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:23,802
TO ASK A WOMAN OUT...

428
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,804
WHO AM I GOING TO ASK?

429
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:32,211
? IF YOU EVER NEED HOLDING ?

430
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,613
? CALL MY NAME ?

431
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,416
? I'LL BE THERE ?

432
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:42,621
? IF YOU EVER NEED HOLDING... ?

433
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,929
ISN'T THIS AMAZING?

434
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:54,133
I HAVE NEVER MADE COFFEE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

435
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,334
THAT IS AMAZING.

436
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,535
CONGRATULATIONS.

437
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,537
YOU KNOW, I FIGURE IF I CAN MAKE COFFEE

438
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,139
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING I CAN'T DO.

439
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,941
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S "IF I CAN INVADE POLAND

440
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,943
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING I CAN'T DO."

441
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,948
IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GOT TO MAKE A WESTERN OMELETTE...

442
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,255
ACTUALLY, I'M REALLY NOT THAT HUNGRY THIS MORNING.

443
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,057
OH, GOOD.

444
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,659
LENNY AND SQUIGGY ARE HERE.

445
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,061
MORNING.

446
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,663
MORNING. MORNING.

447
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,065
MORNING.

448
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,167
MORNING, PAUL.

449
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,468
HELLO, PAUL.

450
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:32,271
HI. PAUL, IS IT?

451
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,778
 THANK YOU.

452
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,680
THANK YOU SO MUCH. STOP.

453
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,981
NO, I'M TELLING YOU, LAST NIGHT WAS...

454
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:46,185
IT WAS LIKE ALL MY BIRTHDAYS, BOTH GRADUATIONS

455
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,987
PLUS THE BARN RAISING SCENE INWITNESS.

456
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,794
WE'LL TALK LATER.

457
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:56,595
YEAH.

458
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,001
THANK YOU.

459
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,511
THAT WASN'T A REAL DATE.

460
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:17,316
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU DO ON A REAL DATE?

461
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:20,118
SHUT UP AND PUT MY TABLE BACK.

462
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,720
 OKAY.

463
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,722
ALL RIGHT, KIDS, I GOT TO GET TO WORK.

464
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,425
IF I DON'T INPUT THOSE NUMBERS...

465
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,228
IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE.

466
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:35,133
SO, LIKE, YOU GUYS ALL HAVE JOBS?

467
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:38,136
YEAH, WE ALL HAVE JOBS.

468
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,739
SEE, THAT'S HOW WE BUY STUFF.

469
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,343
YEAH. I'M AN ACTOR.

470
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:47,145
WOW. HAVE I SEEN YOU IN ANYTHING?

471
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,247
I DOUBT IT.

472
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,848
MOSTLY REGIONAL WORK.

473
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,149
UNLESS YOU CAUGHT

474
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,151
THE WEE ONES PRODUCTION OF PINOCCHIO

475
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,153
AT THE LITTLE THEATER IN THE PARK.

476
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:57,956
IT WAS A JOB, ALL RIGHT?

477
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:01,159
"LOOK, GEPPETTO, I'M A REAL LIVE BOY."

478
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,364
I WILL NOT TAKE THIS ABUSE.

479
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,164
YOU'RE RIGHT.

480
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:07,766
I'M SORRY.

481
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,770
? ONCE I WAS A WOODEN BOY, A LITTLE WOODEN BOY. ?

482
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,374
YOU SHOULD BOTH KNOW THAT HE'S A DEAD MAN.

483
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,478
OH, CHANDLER?

484
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,781
SO, HOW YOU DOING TODAY?

485
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,982
DID YOU SLEEP OKAY?

486
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,984
DID YOU TALK TO BARRY?

487
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:28,787
I CAN'T STOP SMILING.

488
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,290
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU SLEPT

489
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,692
WITH A HANGER IN YOUR MOUTH.

490
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,497
I KNOW.

491
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,098
HE'S JUST SO...

492
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,901
YOU REMEMBER YOU AND TONY DEMARCO?

493
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:43,902
OH, YEAH.

494
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,103
WELL, IT'S LIKE THAT--

495
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:48,006
WITH FEELINGS.

496
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,208
OH, WOW, ARE YOU IN TROUBLE.

497
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,010
BIG TIME!

498
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,211
WANT A WEDDING DRESS?

499
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,413
HARDLY USED.

500
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:58,817
I THINK WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE AHEAD OF OURSELVES HERE.

501
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,421
OKAY. OKAY. I AM JUST GOING TO GET UP, GO TO WORK

502
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,823
AND NOT THINK ABOUT HIM ALL DAY.

503
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,626
OR ELSE I'M JUST GOING TO GET UP AND GO TO WORK.

504
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:08,827
OH, WISH ME LUCK.

505
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:09,728
WHAT FOR?

506
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,330
I'M GOING TO GET

507
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,332
ONE OF THOSE JOB THINGS.

508
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:24,843
HEY, MONICA.

509
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,044
FRANNIE, WELCOME BACK.

510
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,646
HOW WAS FLORIDA?

511
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,449
YOU HAD SEX, DIDN'T YOU?

512
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:33,251
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

513
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,453
OH, I HATE YOU.

514
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,855
I'M PUSHING MY AUNT ROZ THROUGH PARROT JUNGLE

515
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,056
AND YOU'RE HAVING SEX.

516
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:42,060
SO, WHO?

517
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,062
YOU KNOW PAUL?

518
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,064
PAUL, THE WINE GUY?

519
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:47,666
OH,YEAH,I KNOW PAUL.

520
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:52,871
YOU MEAN, YOU KNOW PAUL LIKE I KNOW PAUL?

521
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,272
ARE YOU KIDDING?

522
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,274
I TAKE CREDIT FOR PAUL.

523
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:59,478
BEFORE ME, THERE WAS NO SNAP IN HIS TURTLE

524
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,079
FOR TWO YEARS.

525
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,384
OF COURSE IT WAS A LINE.

526
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,487
WHY WOULD ANYBODY DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?!

527
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,789
I ASSUME WE'RE LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER

528
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,992
MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN "TO GET YOU INTO BED."

529
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,894
I HATE MEN.

530
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,496
I HATE MEN.

531
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,997
OH, NO, DON'T HATE. YOU DON'T WANT

532
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,599
TO PUT THAT OUT IN THE UNIVERSE.

533
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,602
IS IT ME?

534
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:27,606
IS IT LIKE I HAVE SOME SORT OF BEACON THAT ONLY DOGS

535
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,409
AND MEN WITH SEVERE EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS CAN HEAR?

536
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,511
ALL RIGHT, COME HERE, GIVE ME YOUR FEET.

537
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:42,320
I JUST THOUGHT HE WAS NICE, YOU KNOW?

538
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:49,027
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A LINE.

539
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,533
GUESS WHAT?

540
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:55,634
YOU GOT A JOB?

541
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,035
ARE YOU KIDDING?

542
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,637
I'M TRAINED FOR NOTHING.

543
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,541
I WAS LAUGHED OUT OF 12 INTERVIEWS.

544
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,142
YET YOU'RE SURPRISINGLY UPBEAT.

545
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:08,547
YOU WOULD BE, TOO, IF YOU FOUND JOAN AND DAVID BOOTS ON SALE

546
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:09,748
50 PERCENT OFF.

547
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,750
OH, HOW WELL YOU KNOW ME.

548
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,252
THEY'RE MY NEW

549
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:17,155
I DON'T NEED A JOB- I DON'T NEED MY PARENTS-

550
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,157
I'VE GOT GREAT BOOTS BOOTS.

551
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,359
HOW DID YOU PAY FOR THEM?

552
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,861
A CREDIT CARD.

553
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,963
AND WHO PAYS FOR THAT?

554
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,566
UM... MY FATHER.

555
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,671
COME ON, YOU GUYS, IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY?

556
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:35,474
I MEAN, I CAN STOP CHARGING ANYTIME I WANT.

557
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,476
YOU CAN'T LIVE OFF YOUR PARENTS

558
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,677
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

559
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,480
THAT'S WHY I WAS GETTING MARRIED.

560
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,081
COME ON, GIVE HER A BREAK.

561
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,484
IT'S HARD BEING ON YOUR OWN THE FIRST TIME.

562
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,585
THANK YOU.

563
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,887
I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE.

564
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,289
I WAS 14, MY MOM HAD JUST KILLED HERSELF

565
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,291
AND MY STEPDAD WAS BACK IN PRISON.

566
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,694
I GOT HERE AND DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY.

567
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,096
I ENDED UP LIVING WITH THIS ALBINO GUY

568
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:01,299
WHO WAS CLEANING WINDSHIELDS OUTSIDE PORT AUTHORITY

569
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,903
AND THEN HE KILLED HIMSELF, AND THEN I FOUND AROMATHERAPY

570
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,305
SO BELIEVE ME, I KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL.

571
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:15,213
THE WORD YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS "ANYWAY..."

572
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,118
ALL RIGHT.

573
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:21,119
YOU READY?

574
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,521
NO. NO, NO, I'M NOT READY.

575
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,722
HOW CAN I BE READY?

576
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:26,124
"HEY, RACH, YOU READY TO JUMP OUT OF THE AIRPLANE

577
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:26,925
WITHOUT A PARACHUTE?"

578
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,527
COME ON, I CAN'T DO THIS.

579
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,528
YOU CAN. I KNOW YOU CAN.

580
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,629
I DON'T THINK SO.

581
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:31,830
COME ON, YOU MADE COFFEE.

582
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,031
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.

583
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,235
CUT. CUT.

584
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:41,039
CUT. CUT. CUT. CUT. CUT.

585
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,841

586
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,843
YOU KNOW WHAT?

587
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:47,245
I THINK I CAN JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT.

588
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,247
KIND OF LIKE A SYMBOLIC GESTURE.

589
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,449
RACHEL, THAT WAS A LIBRARY CARD.

590
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,854
CUT, CUT, CUT, CUT, CUT...

591
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,856

592
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,858
YOU KNOW, IF YOU LISTEN VERY CLOSELY

593
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,860
YOU CAN HEAR 1,000 RETAILERS SCREAM.

594
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,664

595
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,666
WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD.

596
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:08,767
IT SUCKS.

597
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,368
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT.

598
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:16,374

599
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,478
THAT'S IT.

600
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:22,080
YOU WANT TO CRASH ON THE COUCH?

601
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,382
NO. I GOT TO GO HOME.

602
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:25,984
YOU GOING TO BE OKAY?

603
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:27,986
YEAH.

604
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:30,188
HEY, MON, LOOK WHAT I JUST FOUND ON THE FLOOR.

605
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:32,991
WHAT?

606
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,694
THAT'S PAUL'S WATCH.

607
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:38,096
YOU CAN JUST PUT IT BACK WHERE YOU FOUND IT.

608
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,699
OH, BOY.

609
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,701
ALL RIGHT, GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.

610
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,302
 GOOD NIGHT.

611
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,412
HMM.

612
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:56,715
OH, SORRY. OH, NO. GO. GO.

613
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,316
REALLY, I DON'T WANT IT.

614
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,517
SPLIT IT?

615
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:00,318
OKAY.

616
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,222
THANKS.

617
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,424
YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW THIS

618
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:11,229
BUT BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL I HAD A MAJOR CRUSH ON YOU.

619
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:13,832
I KNEW.

620
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,634
YOU DID? OH.

621
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,036
I ALWAYS FIGURED YOU JUST THOUGHT

622
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,038
I WAS MONICA'S GEEKY OLDER BROTHER.

623
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:21,740
I DID.

624
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,041
OH.

625
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:26,745
LISTEN, DO YOU THINK--

626
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:30,348
AND TRY NOT TO LET MY INTENSE VULNERABILITY

627
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:33,151
BECOME ANY KIND OF A FACTOR HERE--

628
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,953
BUT DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE OKAY

629
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:38,056
IF I ASKED YOU OUT SOMETIME MAYBE?

630
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,960
YEAH.

00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,772
OKAY, MAYBE I WILL.

00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,076
GOOD NIGHT.

00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,398
HEY, WHAT'S WITH YOU?

00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,326
I SAID THAT YOU HAD A NICE BUTT.

649
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,729
IT'S JUST NOT A GREAT BUTT.

650
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,330
AH, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW A GREAT BUTT

651
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,932

WOULD ANYBODY LIKE MORE COFFEE?
