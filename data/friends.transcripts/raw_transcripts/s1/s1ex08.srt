1
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,107
HEY, GORGEOUS.

2
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:08,708
HOW'S IT GOING?

3
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:12,312
DEHYDRATED JAPANESE NOODLES UNDER FLUORESCENT LIGHTS.

4
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:15,115
DOES IT GET BETTER THAN THIS?

5
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,717
QUESTION YOU'RE NOT DATING ANYBODY, ARE YOU?

6
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:20,520
BECAUSE I MET SOMEBODY WHO WOULD BE PERFECT FOR YOU.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,623
AH. YOU SEE, "PERFECT" MIGHT BE A PROBLEM.

8
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,826
HAD YOU SAID "CO DEPENDENT" OR "SELF DESTRUCTIVE"...

9
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:28,728
DO YOU WANT A DATE SATURDAY?

10
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:29,829
YES, PLEASE.

11
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:32,932
OKAY. HE IS CUTE

12
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,134
HE'S FUNNY, HE'S...

13
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:35,335
HE'S A HE?

14
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:36,836
WELL, YEAH.

15
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,038
OH, GOD.

16
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:39,739
I JUST... I THOUGHT...

17
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:42,142
YOU'RE NOT. SO.

18
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,743
GOOD, SHELLY. OKAY.

19
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:47,747
I'M JUST GOING TO GO FLUSH MYSELF DOWN THE TOILET NOW.

20
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,549
OKAY. BYE BYE.

34
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,899
 HARD TO ENJOY A CUP OF RAMEN NOODLES AFTER THAT.

35
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,101
I MEAN, IS THAT RIDICULOUS?

36
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,104
CAN YOU BELIEVE SHE ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT?

37
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,305
UM...

38
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,906
YEAH.

39
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:51,311
WELL, I MEAN, WHEN I FIRST MET YOU

40
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,514
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT MAYBE... POSSIBLY YOU MIGHT BE.

41
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:56,516
YOU DID?

42
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,118
YEAH, BUT THEN YOU SPENT

43
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,120
PHOEBE'S ENTIRE BIRTHDAY PARTY

44
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,721
TALKING TO MY BREASTS

45
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,723
SO THEN I FIGURED MAYBE NOT.

46
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,926
HUH. DID ANY OF THE REST OF YOU GUYS THINK THAT

47
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,528
WHEN YOU FIRST MET ME?

48
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:09,729
I DID.

49
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,732
YEAH, I THINK SO.

50
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:13,833
NOT ME.

51
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,034
NO, NO. ME NEITHER.

52
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,536
ALTHOUGH, UH

53
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,139
YOU KNOW, BACK IN COLLEGE, SUSAN SALIDOR DID.

54
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,340
YOU'RE KIDDING.

55
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,342
DID YOU TELL HER

56
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,443
I WASN'T?

57
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:24,744
NO.

58
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,446
WELL, IT'S JUST BECAUSE

59
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,249
I KIND OF WANTED TO GO OUT WITH HER, TOO

60
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,850
SO I TOLD HER, ACTUALLY

61
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,852
YOU WERE SEEING BERNIE SPELLMAN

62
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,754
WHO ALSO LIKED HER, SO...

63
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,061
WELL, THIS IS FASCINATING.

64
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,063
SO, UH, WHAT IS IT ABOUT ME?

65
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,265
I DON'T KNOW.

66
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:48,067
BECAUSE YOU'RE SMART, YOU'RE FUNNY...

67
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,269
ROSS IS SMART AND FUNNY.

68
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,870
DID YOU EVER THINK THAT ABOUT HIM?

69
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,071
YEAH! RIGHT!

70
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,573
WHAT IS IT?!

71
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,575

72
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,076
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW.

73
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,078
YOU JUST... YOU HAVE A QUALITY.

74
00:02:59,078 --> 00:02:59,879
YES. EXACTLY.

75
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,382
YEAH. A QUALITY.

76
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,283
OH, "A QUALITY." GOOD.

77
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,484
BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED

78
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,486
YOU GUYS WERE GOING TO BE VAGUE ABOUT THIS.

79
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:10,089
YOU KNOW, CHANDLER, I THINK THIS IS GOING TO WORK FOR YOU.

80
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,291
EXCUSE ME?

81
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,492
SURE, SURE.

82
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,794
WOMEN FIND YOU LESS THREATENING

83
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,197
THEY LET THEIR GUARDS DOWN, AND BOOM.

84
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:21,201
YOU'RE LIKE A... STEALTH HETEROSEXUAL.

85
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:25,705

86
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,408
HELLO?

87
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,410
HELLO?

88
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,011
OH. RACHEL.

89
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,214
IT'S PAOLO CALLING FROM ROME.

90
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,014
OH, MY GOD.

91
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,817
HE'S CALLING FROM ROME!

92
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:41,421
BUON GIORNO, CARO MIO.

93
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,423
SO HE'S CALLING FROM ROME.

94
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,024
I COULD DO THAT.

95
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,427
YOU JUST GOT TO GO TO ROME.

96
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:53,132
MONICA, YOUR DAD JUST BEEPED IN, BUT CAN YOU MAKE IT QUICK?

97
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,134
BECAUSE I'M TALKING TO ROME.

98
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,937
I'M TALKING TO ROME.

99
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:58,738
HEY, DAD.

100
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,541
WHAT'S UP?

101
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,742
OH, GOD.

102
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,945
ROSS. IT'S NANA.

103
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,454
HEY.

104
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,055
OH, HI.

105
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:16,856
OH, ROSS.

106
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,057
HI, AUNT LILLIAN.

107
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,659
HEY, DAD.

108
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:22,962
SO, UH...

109
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,564
HOW'S SHE DOING?

110
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:27,467
THE DOCTOR SAYS IT'S A MATTER OF HOURS.

111
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,068
HOW ARE YOU, MOM?

112
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,070
ME? I'M FINE. FINE.

113
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,072
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

114
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,276
WHAT'S WITH YOUR HAIR?

115
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,477
WHAT?

116
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,078
WHAT'S DIFFERENT?

117
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,280
NOTHING.

118
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,082
OH. MAYBE THAT'S IT.

119
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,485
SHE'S UNBELIEVABLE! HER MOTHER IS...

120
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,686
RELAX, RELAX.

121
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:50,290
OKAY, WE ARE GOING TO BE HERE FOR A WHILE

122
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,891
IT LOOKS LIKE

123
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,294
AND WE STILL HAVE BOYFRIENDS

124
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,596
AND YOUR CAREER TO COVER.

125
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,302
...THE FUZZY LITTLE MINTS

126
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,704
AT THE BOTTOM OF HER PURSE.

127
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,507
OH! YEAH. THEY WERE GROSS.

128
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,909
OH! YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE?

129
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,911
HER SWEET 'N LOWs--

130
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:15,515
HOW SHE WAS ALWAYS STEALING THEM FROM RESTAURANTS.

131
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,517
NOT JUST RESTAURANTS

132
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,118
FROM OUR HOUSE.

133
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,520
MRS. GELLER?

134
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,927
 SHE LOOKS SO SMALL.

135
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:28,828
I KNOW.

136
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,830
AT LEAST SHE'S WITH POP POP

137
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,232
AND AUNT PHYLLIS NOW.

138
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,335
AUNT PHYLLIS IS DEAD?

139
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,036
YEAH, FOR LIKE SIX YEARS.

140
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,037
WHERE WAS I?

141
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,138
WHERE WERE YOU?

142
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,740
CAN WE FOCUS, PLEASE?

143
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,553
GOOD BYE, NANA.

144
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,760
BYE, NANA.

145
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,961

146
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,863

147
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,866
ROSS!

148
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,772
WHAT IS GOING ON?

149
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:16,175
YOU KNOW HOW THE NURSE SAID THAT NANA HAD PASSED?

150
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,177
WELL, SHE'S NOT QUITE.

151
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,480
WHAT?

152
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,881
SHE'S NOT PASSED.

153
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,082
SHE'S PRESENT.

154
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,283
SHE'S BACK.

155
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:25,885
WHAT'S GOING ON?

156
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,887
SHE MAY HAVE DIED.

157
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,189
SHE MAY HAVE DIED?

158
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,491
WE'RE LOOKING INTO IT.

159
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,795
I'LL GO SEE.

160
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,797

161
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,999
THIS ALMOST NEVER HAPPENS.

162
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,300

163
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,005

164
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,419
NOW SHE'S PASSED.

165
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,230
I JUST HAVE TO KNOW, OKAY?

166
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,232
IS IT MY HAIR?

167
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,635
YES, CHANDLER, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.

168
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,836
IT'S YOUR HAIR.

169
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,238
YEAH. YOU HAVE HOMOSEXUAL HAIR.

170
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,742
HEY.

171
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:23,943
HEY.

172
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,744
HI.

173
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:25,945
HI.

174
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,547
SO, UM, DID SHE..?

175
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,348
TWICE.

176
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,350
TWICE?

177
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,152
OH, THAT SUCKS.

178
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,756
ARE YOU GUYS OKAY?

179
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,458
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S WEIRD.

180
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,460
I MEAN, I KNOW SHE'S GONE

181
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,462
BUT I JUST DON'T FEEL, UH...

182
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,464
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE SHE'S NOT REALLY GONE.

183
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,866
NO, NO. SHE'S GONE.

184
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,468
WE CHECKED.

185
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,870
A LOT.

186
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,073
NO, I MEAN, MAYBE NO ONE EVER REALLY GOES, YOU KNOW?

187
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,675
EVER SINCE MY MOM DIED

188
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,878
EVERY NOW AND THEN, I GET THIS FEELING

189
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:02,081
THAT SHE'S, LIKE, RIGHT HERE, YOU KNOW?

190
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,284
OH! AND DEBBIE

191
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,286
MY BEST FRIEND FROM JUNIOR HIGH

192
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,490
GOT STRUCK BY LIGHTNING ON A MINIATURE GOLF COURSE.

193
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,492
I ALWAYS GET

194
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,393
THIS REALLY STRONG "DEBBIE" VIBE

195
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,997
WHENEVER I USE ONE OF THOSE LITTLE YELLOW PENCILS

196
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,298
YOU KNOW?

197
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,703
I MISS HER.

198
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,105
OH. HERE, PHEEBS.

199
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,707
WANT THIS?

200
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,709
OH. THANKS. SURE.

201
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,512
I JUST SHARPENED HER THIS MORNING.

202
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,314
NOW, SEE, I DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF THAT.

203
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,117
I THINK WHEN YOU'RE DEAD, YOU'RE DEAD.

204
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,520
YOU'RE GONE. YOU'RE WORM FOOD.

205
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,325
SO CHANDLER LOOKS GAY, HUH?

206
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,032
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS IS

207
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,034
BUT IT'S NOT DEBBIE.

208
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,841
DAD, LET'S JUST MAKE A DECISION.

209
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,342
YOU'RE RIGHT. THIS IS CRAZY.

210
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,944
IT'S GOING INTO THE GROUND.

211
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,346
WE SHOULD JUST GET THE MOST BASIC THING.

212
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:08,948
RIGHT. OKAY, THAT WOULD BE

213
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:12,552
THE NONPROTECTIVE CORRUGATED FIBERBOARD WITH WHITE LAMINATE.

214
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,356
DAD, WE CAN'T BURY NANA IN A DRESSER FROM IKEA.

215
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:21,360
SEE, THIS IS WHY YOUR MOTHER BUYS ALL MY CLOTHES.

216
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,362
I HATE TO SHOP. I HATE IT.

217
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:26,566
DAD, DON'T YOU THINK THIS MIGHT BE MORE ABOUT THE FACT

218
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,167
THAT ONCE YOU MAKE THE DECISION

219
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,970
IT'S LIKE ACKNOWLEDGING NANA'S ACTUALLY GONE?

220
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,574
NO, I REALLY HATE TO SHOP.

221
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,382
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A CLOSED CASKET.

222
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,485
WELL, THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE CAN'T LOOK NICE.

223
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:50,990
OH.

224
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,692
SWEETIE, YOU THINK YOU

225
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,293
CAN GET IN THERE?

226
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,295
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.

227
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,713

228
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,415
HERE'S MY RETAINER!

229
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,326
I WAS JUST THINKING

230
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:28,928
WHEN MY TIME COMES...

231
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,129
DAD!

232
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,530
LISTEN TO ME!

233
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,634
WHEN MY TIME COMES...

234
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,036
I WANT TO BE BURIED AT SEA.

235
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:40,339
YOU WHAT?

236
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,842
I WANT TO BE BURIED AT SEA.

237
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,844
IT LOOKS LIKE FUN.

238
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,346
DEFINE "FUN."

239
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,147
COME ON!

240
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,149
YOU'LL MAKE A DAY OF IT.

241
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,551
YOU'LL GET A BOAT, PACK A LUNCH...

242
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:55,254
AND THEN WE THROW YOUR BODY IN THE WATER.

243
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,256
GEE, THAT DOES SOUND FUN.

244
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,058
EVERYONE THINKS THEY KNOW ME.

245
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:02,261
EVERYONE SAYS, "JACK GELLER, SO PREDICTABLE."

246
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,664
MAYBE AFTER I'M GONE, THEY'LL SAY

247
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,466
"BURIED AT SEA. HUH."

248
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,872
THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT THEY'LL SAY.

249
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,173
I'D LIKE THAT.

250
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,687
HEY, GORGEOUS.

251
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,888
HEY.

252
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:32,091
LOOK, I'M SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY. I, UH...

253
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,093
NO, NO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, BELIEVE ME.

254
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,495
APPARENTLY, OTHER PEOPLE HAVE MADE THE SAME MISTAKE, SO...

255
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:37,697
OH!

256
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,898
OKAY!

257
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,099
PHEW!

258
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,904
SO, UH, WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS ABOUT ME?

259
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:49,408
I DON'T KNOW, UH, YOU JUST HAVE A...

260
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,410
A QUALITY. A QUALITY. RIGHT.

261
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,012
YOU KNOW, IT'S A SHAME

262
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,915
BECAUSE YOU AND LOWELL WOULD HAVE MADE

263
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,316
A GREAT COUPLE.

264
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,719
LOWELL? FINANCIAL SERVICES LOWELL?

265
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,721
THAT'S WHO YOU SAW ME WITH?

266
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,322
WHAT? HE'S CUTE.

267
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:04,724
WELL, YEAH.

268
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,526
HE'S NO BRIAN IN PAYROLL.

269
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,230
IS BRIAN...?

270
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,732
NO. I DON'T KNOW.

271
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,134
THE POINT IS THAT IF YOU WERE GOING TO SET ME UP WITH SOMEONE

272
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,937
I'D LIKE TO THINK YOU WOULD SET ME UP WITH SOMEBODY LIKE HIM.

273
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,740
WELL, I THINK BRIAN'S A LITTLE

274
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,641
OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.

275
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,645
EXCUSE ME.

276
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,849
YOU DON'T THINK I COULD GET A BRIAN?

277
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,653
BECAUSE I COULD GET A BRIAN.

278
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,255
BELIEVE YOU ME.

279
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,258
I'M REALLY NOT.

280
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,162
THIS ONE?

281
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,764
NO.

282
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,267
I HAVE SHOWN YOU EVERY DRESS WE HAVE.

283
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,871
UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR MOTHER TO SPEND ETERNITY

284
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:55,474
IN A LEMON YELLOW PANTSUIT, GO WITH THE BURGUNDY.

285
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,176
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER WE PICK

286
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,178
SHE WOULD HAVE TOLD US IT'S THE WRONG ONE.

287
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,379
YOU'RE RIGHT.

288
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,580
WE'LL GO WITH THE BURGUNDY.

289
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,082
A FINE CHOICE.

290
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,683
I'M COMING OUT.

291
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,485
WAIT! WE NEED SHOES.

292
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:11,690
OKAY.

293
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,095
HOW ABOUT THESE?

294
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,397
THAT'S REALLY A DAY SHOE.

295
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:22,401
AND WHERE SHE'S GOING, EVERYONE ELSE WILL BE DRESSIER.

296
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,604
COULD WE SEE SOMETHING IN A SLIMMER HEEL?

297
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,812
OKAY. I HAVE NOTHING IN AN EVENING SHOE

298
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,814
IN THE BURGUNDY.

299
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,417
I CAN SHOW YOU SOMETHING IN A SILVER THAT MAY WORK.

300
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,419
NO. IT REALLY SHOULD BE BURGUNDY.

301
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,222
MM. UNLESS WE GO WITH A DIFFERENT DRESS.

302
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,023
YES.

303
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,025
NO, NO, NO, NO. WAIT!

304
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:50,029
WAIT. I MAY HAVE SOMETHING IN THE BACK.

305
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,636
AH.

306
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,043
MY GOD.

307
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,145
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT, DEAR?

308
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,947
YEAH. YEAH. JUST...

309
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,349
JUST NANA STUFF.

310
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,767
HOW WE DOING? YOU GUYS READY?

311
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,369
SO MOM ALREADY CALLED THIS MORNING

312
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,771
TO REMIND ME NOT TO WEAR MY HAIR UP.

313
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,573
DID YOU KNOW MY EARS WERE NOT MY BEST FEATURE?

314
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:38,177
SOME DAYS IT'S ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT.

315
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,578
HI. I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

316
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,580
I COULDN'T FIND MY BEARINGS.

317
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,582
OH. YOU MEAN YOUR EARRINGS?

318
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,385
WHAT DID I SAY?

319
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,887
ARE THESE THE SHOES?

320
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,090
YES. PAOLO SENT THEM FROM ITALY.

321
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,291
WHAT? WE, UH...

322
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,293
WE DON'T HAVE SHOES HERE?

323
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:56,996
MORNING.

324
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,397
WE READY TO GO?

325
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,599
WELL, DON'T WE LOOK NICE ALL DRESSED UP?

326
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,004
IT'S STUFF LIKE THAT, ISN'T IT?

327
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,117
IT WAS A REALLY BEAUTIFUL SERVICE.

328
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,718
IT REALLY WAS.

329
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:23,522
OH... COME HERE, SWEETHEART.

330
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:27,726
YOU KNOW...

331
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,029
I THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR YOU

332
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,630
TO START USING NIGHT CREAM.

333
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,536

334
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,737
WHAT?

335
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,839
NOTHING, NOTHING-- JUST YOUR OVERCOAT

336
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,841
SOUNDS REMARKABLY LIKE BRENT MUSBURGER.

337
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:43,742
CHECK IT OUT.

338
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,545
GIANTS/COWBOYS.

339
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:47,947
YOU'RE WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME

340
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,148
AT A FUNERAL?

341
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,150
NO, IT'S THE PREGAME.

342
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,953
I'M GOING TO WATCH IT AT THE RECEPTION.

343
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,156
YOU ARE A FRIGHTENING, FRIGHTENING MAN.

344
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,757
OH, NO!

345
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,459
MY NEW PAOLO SHOES.

346
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,861
OH, I HOPE THEY'RE NOT RUINED.

347
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:10,169
GOD, WHAT A GREAT DAY.

348
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,371
WHAT? WEATHER WISE.

349
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,773
I KNOW.

350
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,775
THE AIR, THE TREES...

351
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:20,379
EVEN THOUGH NANA'S GONE, THERE'S SOMETHING ALMOST...

352
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,580
I DON'T KNOW...

353
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,182
ALMOST LIFE...

354
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,684
ARE YOU OKAY?

355
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:26,885
ROSS!

356
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:28,487
I'M FINE. I'M FINE.

357
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,688
OHH.

358
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,090
I'M JUST... JUST...

359
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,892
HAVING MY WORST FEAR REALIZED, BUT...

360
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,801
OKAY, DON'T WORRY.

361
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,604
I'M JUST CHECKING TO SEE IF THE MUSCLE'S IN SPASM.

362
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:46,505
HUH.

363
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,706
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

364
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,109
YOU MISSED A BELT LOOP.

365
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,111
OH, N N NO.

366
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,913
OKAY, IT'S IN SPASM.

367
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,815
HERE, SWEETIE.

368
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,218
I TOOK THESE WHEN I HAD MY GOLFING ACCIDENT.

369
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,419
THANKS, MOM.

370
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:08,827
OH, GO.

371
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,429
SORRY.

372
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,431
HI, I'M ANDREA.

373
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,833
I'M DOROTHY'S DAUGHTER.

374
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,435
HI, I'M CHANDLER, AND...

375
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,837
I HAVE NO IDEA WHO DOROTHY IS.

376
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,142
 HEY, LOOK WHO'S UP.

377
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,343
HEY.

378
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,544
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

379
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,647
I FEEL GREAT.

380
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,249
I FEEL GREAT.

381
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,651
I FLEEL GREAT.

382
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,954
WOW, THOSE PILLS REALLY WORKED, HUH?

383
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:39,458
NOT THE FIRST TWO, BUT THE SECOND TWO WHOO...

384
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,664
I LOVE YOU GUYS.

385
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,666
YOU GUYS ARE THE GREATEST.

386
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,069
I LOVE MY SISTER.

387
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,471
I LOVE PHEEB.

388
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,073
THAT'S SO NICE.

389
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,274
CHANDLER...

390
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,475
HEY.

391
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,077
I LOVE YOU, MAN.

392
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,678
AND LISTEN, MAN.

393
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,481
IF YOU WANT TO BE GAY, BE GAY.

394
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,487
DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.

395
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,089
YOU WERE RIGHT.

396
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,595
RACHEL.

397
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,398
RACHEL...

398
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,201

399
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,003
I DO LOVE YOU.

400
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,005
OH, ROSS...

401
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,007
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

402
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:32,411
OH, NO, I REALLY LOVE YOU.

403
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,515
I REALLY LOVE YOU.

404
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,916
OHH...

405
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,918
YOU DON'T GET IT.

406
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,926
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

407
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:51,130
UH... JUST A, UH... HEARING DISABILITY.

408
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,132
WHAT'S THE SCORE?

409
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,434
17-14, GIANTS.

410
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,836
THREE MINUTES TO GO IN THE THIRD.

411
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,037
BEAUTIFUL.

412
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,146

413
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,747
PHEEBS...

414
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,150
COULD YOU MAYBE HAND ME A CRACKER?

415
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,054
YOUR GRANDMOTHER WOULD HAVE HATED THIS.

416
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,156
WELL, SURE...

417
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,958
WHAT WITH IT BEING HER FUNERAL AND ALL.

418
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,962
NO, I'D BE HEARING ABOUT

419
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:27,166
WHY DIDN'T I GET THE HONEY GLAZED HAM?

420
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,568
OR I DIDN'T SPEND ENOUGH ON FLOWERS.

421
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,370
AND IF I SPENT MORE, SHE'D BE SAYING

422
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,272
"WHY ARE YOU WASTING YOUR MONEY?

423
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,873
I DON'T NEED FLOWERS. I'M DEAD."

424
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:37,676
THAT SOUNDS LIKE NANA.

425
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,580
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GROW UP

426
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:46,785
WITH SOMEONE WHO IS CRITICAL OF EVERY SINGLE THING YOU SAY?

427
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,589
I CAN IMAGINE.

428
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:51,990
I'M TELLING YOU.

429
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,194
IT'S A WONDER YOUR MOTHER TURNED OUT TO BE

430
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,996
THE POSITIVE, LIFE AFFIRMING PERSON SHE IS.

431
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,999
THAT IS A WONDER.

432
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,605
SO, TELL ME SOMETHING, MOM.

433
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,007
IF YOU HAD TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN

434
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:12,211
I MEAN, IF SHE WAS HERE RIGHT NOW

435
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,313
WOULD YOU TELL HER?

436
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,614
TELL HER WHAT?

437
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,116
HOW SHE DROVE YOU CRAZY?

438
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,519
PICKING ON EVERY LITTLE DETAIL

439
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,122
LIKE... YOUR HAIR, FOR EXAMPLE.

440
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:28,327
I'M NOT SURE I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT.

441
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,230
DO YOU THINK THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER

442
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,632
IF YOU'D JUST TOLD HER THE TRUTH?

443
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,237
NO.

444
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,441
I THINK SOME THINGS ARE BETTER LEFT UNSAID.

445
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:46,044
I THINK IT'S NICER WHEN PEOPLE JUST GET ALONG.

446
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:49,848
HUH.

447
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:50,949
MORE WINE, DEAR?

448
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,651
OH, I THINK SO.

449
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:04,162
THOSE EARRINGS LOOK REALLY LOVELY ON YOU.

450
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,066
THANK YOU.

451
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,668
THEY'RE YOURS.

452
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,871
ACTUALLY, THEY WERE NANA'S.

453
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,475
 NO!

454
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,476
OH, MY GOD!

455
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,077
NOW I'M DEPRESSED.

456
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,683
EVEN MORE THAN I WAS.

457
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,893
OH, LOOK, THIS IS MY FIRST GRADE PICTURE.

458
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,094

459
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:39,398
OH, PLEASE IGNORE THE "DYNOMITE" T-SHIRT.

460
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,400
HEY, WHO'S THIS LITTLE NAKED GUY?

461
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,502
OH, THAT NAKED GUY WOULD BE ME.

462
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,605
AW, LOOK AT THE LITTLE THING.

463
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,007
YES.

464
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,709
YES, FINE.

465
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:51,910
THAT IS MY PENIS.

466
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,912
CAN WE BE GROWN UPS NOW?

467
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,815
WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE?

468
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,016
GOT ME.

469
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,118
OH, THAT'S NANA RIGHT THERE

470
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,320
IN THE MIDDLE.

471
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,322
LET'S SEE.

472
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,124
"ME AND THE GANG AT JAVA JOE'S."

473
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,527
WOW, MONICA, YOU LOOK JUST LIKE YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

474
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,128
HOW OLD WAS SHE THERE?

475
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,430
LET'S SEE...

476
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,631
1939.

477
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,232
24, 25.

478
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,434
HUH.

479
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,436
IT LOOKS LIKE A FUN GANG.

480
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,444
OOH, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

481
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,045
I GOT MONICA NAKED.

482
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,647
 LET ME SEE!

483
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:32,651
NO, NO. THAT WOULD BE ME AGAIN.

484
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,458
I'M, UH... JUST TRYING SOMETHING.

485
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,169
HEY, LOWELL.

486
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,371
OH, HEY, CHANDLER.

487
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,972
SO, HOW'S IT GOING

488
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:57,175
DOWN THERE IN FINANCIAL SERVICES?

489
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,777
IT'S LIKE MARDI GRAS

490
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:01,179
WITHOUT THE PAPIER MACHE HEADS.

491
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,381
HOW ABOUT YOU?

492
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,582
GOOD, GOOD.

493
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,984
LISTEN, UM...

494
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,387
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHELLY TOLD YOU

495
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,389
ABOUT ME, BUT, UH...

496
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,591
I'M NOT.

497
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:13,792
I KNOW.

498
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,394
THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HER.

499
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,595
REALLY?

500
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,196
YEAH.

501
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,198
SO, YOU CAN TELL?

502
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,701
PRETTY MUCH.

503
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,302
MOST OF THE TIME.

504
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:26,705
WE HAVE A KIND OF... RADAR.

505
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:30,108
SO YOU DON'T THINK I HAVE A...

506
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,710
A QUALITY?

507
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,812
SPEAKING FOR MY PEOPLE...

508
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,615
I'D HAVE TO SAY NO.

509
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,119
BY THE WAY, YOUR FRIEND BRIAN FROM PAYROLL...

510
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,320
HE IS.

511
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,722
HE IS?

512
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,124
YUP, AND WAY OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.

513
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,529
OUT OF MY LEAGUE?

514
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,130
I COULD GET A BRIAN.

515
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,933
IF I WANTED TO GET A BRIAN, I COULD GET A BRIAN.

516
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,935
HEY, BRIAN.
