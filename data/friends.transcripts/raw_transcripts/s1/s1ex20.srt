1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:00,800

2
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:05,105
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD ACTUALLY SAY THAT.

3
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:08,708
I WOULD MUCH RATHER BE MR. PEANUT THAN MR. SALTY.

4
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:11,911
NO WAY. MR. SALTY IS A SAILOR, ALL RIGHT?

5
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:14,714
HE'S GOT TO BE, LIKE, THE TOUGHEST SNACK THERE IS.

6
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,317
I DON'T KNOW.

7
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:20,520
YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH CORNNUTS.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,721
THEY'RE CRAZY!

9
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:23,323
OH, MY GOD.

10
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,725
GUYS, YOU GOT TO COME SEE THIS.

11
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,727
THERE'S SOME CREEP OUT THERE

12
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:29,129
WITH A TELESCOPE.

13
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,730

14
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,332
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

15
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,334
HE'S LOOKING RIGHT AT US.

16
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,336
OH, THAT IS SO SICK.

17
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:37,937
I FEEL VIOLATED...

18
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,939
AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY.

19
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,941
WHY DO PEOPLE DO THAT?

20
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:44,544

21
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,147
OH, LOOK! UGLY NAKED GUY GOT GRAVITY BOOTS!

36
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:38,598
I AM TELLING YOU

37
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,801
YEARS FROM NOW SCHOOL CHILDREN WILL STUDY IT

38
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:45,405
AS ONE OF THE GREATEST FIRST DATES OF ALL TIME.

39
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,606
OH, YAY!

40
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,007
I'LL SAY, YAY.

41
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,209
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

42
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,211
WE COULD TOTALLY BE OURSELVES.

43
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,213
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO PLAY ANY GAMES.

44
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,114
SO, HAVE YOU CALLED HER YET?

45
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,915
AND LET HER KNOW I LIKE HER?

46
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,217
WHAT ARE YOU-- INSANE?

47
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,818
OH, GUYS...

48
00:01:58,918 --> 00:01:59,719
IT'S THE NEXT DAY.

49
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,721
HOW NEEDY DO I WANT TO SEEM?

50
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:02,522
I'M RIGHT, RIGHT?

51
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,723
OH, YEAH.

52
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,125
OH, YEAH, LET HER DANGLE.

53
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,927
OH. I CAN'T BELIEVE MY PARENTS

54
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:11,931
ARE ACTUALLY PRESSURING ME TO FIND ONE OF YOU PEOPLE.

55
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,334
GOD, COME ON, JUST DO IT.

56
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,935
CALL HER.

57
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,937
STOP BEING SO TESTOSTERONEY.

58
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:21,541
WHICH, BY THE WAY IS THE REAL SAN FRANCISCO TREAT.

59
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,148
I GOT HER MACHINE.

60
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,149
HER ANSWERING MACHINE?

61
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,051
NO, INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, HER LEAF BLOWER PICKED UP.

62
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,056
SO, UM, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING?

63
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:41,161
OH, NO, NO, NO, LAST TIME I LEFT A SPONTANEOUS MESSAGE

64
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,563
I ENDED UP USING THE PHRASE "YES INDEEDY O."

65
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,965
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, IT'S RACHEL AND BARRY.

66
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,169
NO, NO, NO, DON'T EVERYBODY LOOK AT ONCE.

67
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,371
OKAY, OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

68
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,772
OKAY, THEY'RE JUST TALKING.

69
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,674
YEAH, WELL... DOES HE LOOK UPSET?

70
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,477
DOES HE LOOK LIKE HE WAS JUST TOLD TO SHOVE ANYTHING?

71
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,679
NO.

72
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,882
NO, ACTUALLY, HE'S SMILING, AND... OH, MY GOD!

73
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,083
DON'T DO THAT!

74
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,285
WHAT, WHAT, WHAT?!

75
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,687
THAT MAN ACROSS THE STREET JUST KICKED THAT PIGEON.

76
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,091
OH.

77
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:16,095
AND BASICALLY THAT'S HOW A BILL BECOMES A LAW.

78
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,099
HEY, RACH.

79
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,701
HI, RACH.

80
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,102
HOW'D IT GO?

81
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,304
YOU KNOW, IT WAS, UH...

82
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,905
I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY GREAT.

83
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,907
TOOK ME TO LUNCH AT THE RUSSIAN TEA ROOM.

84
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,710
I HAD THAT CHICKEN, YOU KNOW, WHERE YOU POKE IT

85
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,712
AND ALL THE BUTTER SQUIRTS OUT.

86
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,315
NOT A GOOD DAY FOR BIRDS.

87
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,217
AND THEN WE TOOK A WALK DOWN TO BENDEL'S.

88
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,418
I TOLD HIM NOT TO

89
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,221
BUT HE GOT ME A LITTLE BOTTLE OF CHANEL.

90
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,322
OH, THAT'S NICE.

91
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,923
NOW, WAS THAT BEFORE OR AFTER

92
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:45,925
YOU TOLD HIM TO STOP CALLING

93
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,527
STOP SENDING YOU FLOWERS

94
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,529
AND TO GENERALLY LEAVE YOU ALONE, HMM?

95
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,731
RIGHT.

96
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,934
WELL, WE NEVER ACTUALLY GOT TO THAT.

97
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,638
OH, IT WAS JUST SO NICE TO SEE HIM AGAIN, YOU KNOW?

98
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,841
IT WAS... IT WAS COMFORTABLE, AND IT WAS FAMILIAR.

99
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,443
IT WAS JUST NICE.

100
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,445
THAT'S... THAT'S NICE TWICE.

101
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,447
RACHEL, WHAT'S GOING ON?

102
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,950
ISN'T THIS THE SAME BARRY WHO YOU LEFT AT THE ALTAR?

103
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,952
DUH. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

104
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:16,055
YEAH, BUT IT WAS DIFFERENT WITH HIM TODAY.

105
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,657
I MEAN... AND HE WASN'T LIKE...

106
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,659
"ORTHODONTIST GUY," YOU KNOW?

107
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,261
I MEAN, WE HAD FUN.

108
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,663
IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT?

109
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,665
YES!

110
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,667
WHY?

111
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,269
I HAVE MY REASONS.

112
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,071
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THE FACT

113
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,073
THAT HE'S ENGAGED TO ANOTHER WOMAN

114
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,476
WHO JUST HAPPENS TO BE YOUR EX BEST FRIEND?

115
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,279
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

116
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,480
I KNOW IT'S STUPID.

117
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,181
I'LL GO SEE HIM THIS AFTERNOON

118
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,183
AND I WILL JUST PUT AN END TO IT.

119
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,685
WOW!

120
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,888
WOW.

121
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,490
YEAH.

122
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,492
I'M NOT CRAZY, RIGHT?

123
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,894
I MEAN, IT WAS NEVER LIKE THAT.

124
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,896
NO, IT WASN'T.

125
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,703
OH... IT WAS SO NICE HAVING THIS LITTLE SINK HERE.

126
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:13,713
THEN, WITH AUTHORITY, HANG UP.

127
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:17,317
WILL YOU JUST LEAVE HER THE MESSAGE ALREADY?

128
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,918
OKAY, ALL RIGHT. FINE.

129
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,725
OH, DANIELLE, I WASN'T EXPECTING THE MACHINE.

130
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,530
GIVE ME A CALL WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE.

131
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,333

132
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,335
BYE BYE.

133
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,936
OH, GOD.

134
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,941
THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR THE PAST TWO HOURS?

135
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,443
HEY, I'VE BEEN HONING IT.

136
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,546
WHAT WAS WITH THE DISHES?

137
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,147
OH, UH... I WANT HER TO THINK

138
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,550
I MIGHT BE IN A RESTAURANT, YOU KNOW...

139
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,153
I MIGHT HAVE SOME KIND OF LIFE, LIKE I HAVEN'T BEEN SITTING

140
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,556
AROUND HERE HONING FOR THE LAST TWO HOURS.

141
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,857
LOOK, LOOK, HE'S DOING IT AGAIN--

142
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,058
THE GUY WITH THE TELESCOPE.

143
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,060
OH, MY GOD!

144
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,364
OH. GO AWAY!

145
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,366
STOP LOOKING IN HERE!

146
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,768
GREAT. NOW HE'S WAVING BACK.

147
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,271
MAN, WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT GUY.

148
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,674
THIS MORNING I CAUGHT HIM LOOKING INTO OUR APARTMENT.

149
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,175
IT CREEPS ME OUT.

150
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,777
I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T DO STUFF.

151
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,179
WHAT KIND OF STUFF?

152
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:23,383
WILL YOU GROW UP?

153
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,785
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SEXY STUFF

154
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,187
BUT LIKE WHEN I'M COOKING NAKED.

155
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,591
YOU COOK NAKED?

156
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,394
YEAH, TOAST, OATMEAL, NOTHING THAT SPATTERS.

157
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,298
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME FOR?

158
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,900
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

159
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,004
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

160
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,205
OH, I JUST...

161
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,207
BARRY, THIS WAS NOT GOOD.

162
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,409
NO, IT WAS.

163
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,411
IT WAS VERY, VERY GOOD.

164
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,413
WELL, WHAT ABOUT MINDY?

165
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,415
OH, WAY BETTER THAN MINDY.

166
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,817
NO, NOT THAT.

167
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,219
I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT YOU AND MINDY?

168
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,823
LOOK, IF YOU WANT, I'LL JUST BREAK IT OFF WITH HER.

169
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,825
NO, NO. I MEAN DON'T DO THAT.

170
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,827
I MEAN, NOT FOR ME.

171
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:11,531
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.

172
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:12,732
UH, THANKS, BERNICE.

173
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,735
LET'S GO AWAY THIS WEEKEND.

174
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,938
OH, BARRY, COME ON, THIS IS ALL WAY TOO...

175
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,540
WE CAN GO TO ARUBA.

176
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,041
WHEN I WENT THERE

177
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,045
ON WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUR HONEYMOON, IT WAS REALLY NICE.

178
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,647
YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED IT.

179
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,250
I HAD A BRA.

180
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,464
HEY, DR. FARBER.

181
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,267
ALL RIGHT, MISS GREEN, EVERYTHING LOOKS FINE.

182
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,869
I THINK WE'RE STARTING TO SEE

183
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,471
SOME REAL PROGRESS HERE.

184
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,475
WHAT?

185
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,676
I'M 12.

186
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,678
I'M NOT STUPID.

187
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,589
CAN I USE YOUR PHONE?

188
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,591
YEAH. BUT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE

189
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:15,194
THAT THING IN YOUR HAND CAN ALSO BE USED AS A PHONE.

190
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,395
ALL RIGHT.

191
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,398

192
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,000
YES, IT'S WORKING.

193
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,504
WHY ISN'T SHE CALLING ME BACK?

194
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,906
MAYBE SHE NEVER GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

195
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,008
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT, YOU COULD CALL HER MACHINE

196
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,209
AND IF SHE HAS A LOT OF BEEPS

197
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,012
THAT MEANS SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T GET HER MESSAGES YET.

198
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,114
YOU DON'T THINK THAT MAKES ME SEEM A LITTLE...

199
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,316
DESPERATE, NEEDY, PATHETIC?

200
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,419
AH, YOU OBVIOUSLY SAW MY PERSONAL AD.

201
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,824
HOW MANY BEEPS?

202
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,626
SHE ANSWERED.

203
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,929
YOU SEE, THIS IS WHERE YOU'D USE

204
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,531
THAT "HELLO" WORD WE TALKED ABOUT.

205
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,833
I'M NOT GOING TO TALK TO HER.

206
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,434
SHE OBVIOUSLY GOT MY MESSAGE

207
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,436
AND IS CHOOSING NOT TO CALL ME.

208
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,438
NOW I'M NEEDY AND SNUBBED.

209
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:03,042
GOD, I MISS JUST BEING NEEDY.

210
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,744
 HEY.

211
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:05,845
HOW'D HE TAKE IT?

212
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,648
PRETTY WELL, ACTUALLY.

213
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,450
UH, RACH?

214
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,652
YEAH?

215
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,855
HOW COME YOU HAVE DENTAL FLOSS IN YOUR HAIR?

216
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,056
OH, DO I?

217
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,257
UH HUH.

218
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,162
WE ENDED UP HAVING SEX IN HIS CHAIR.

219
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,665
YOU HAD SEX IN HIS CHAIR?!

220
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:33,072
OH, I SAID THAT A LITTLE TOO LOUDLY, DIDN'T I?

221
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,776
YOU... YOU HAD WHAT?

222
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,178
SEX IN HIS CHAIR.

223
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,784
WHAT, UH, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

224
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:45,685
I DON'T KNOW.

225
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,087
WE STILL CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER.

226
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,388
THERE'S A HISTORY THERE.

227
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,990
IT'S LIKE YOU AND CAROL.

228
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,592
NO. NO, NO.

229
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,195
IT'S NOTHING LIKE ME AND CAROL.

230
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,798
PLEASE. IF SHE SAID TO YOU, "ROSS, I WANT YOU

231
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:02,802
ON THIS COUCH, RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW," WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

232
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,206
IF IT HELPS, I COULD SLIDE OVER.

233
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:12,011
IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SITUATION.

234
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,212
IT'S APPLES AND ORANGES.

235
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,214
IT'S ORTHODONTISTS AND LESB...

236
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,816
I GOT TO GO.

237
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,719
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

238
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,721
I JUST HAVE TO GO, ALL RIGHT?!

239
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,723
DO I NEED A REASON, HUH?

240
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,725
I MEAN, I HAVE THINGS TO DO WITH MY LIFE.

241
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,127
I HAVE A JAM PACKED SCHEDULE

242
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,731
AND I AM LATE FOR KEEPING UP WITH IT, OKAY?

243
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,633

244
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,635
HELLO? HELLO?

245
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,439

246
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,642
HELLO?

247
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,644
HI...

248
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,646
MINDY.

249
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,148
HI. HI. HOW ARE YOU?

250
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,150
YES, YES, I HEARD.

251
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,351
CONGRATULATIONS.

252
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,953
THAT IS SO GREAT.

253
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,756
REALLY? OH, GOD...

254
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:57,957
OKAY.

255
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,959
OKAY, WELL, I'M WORKING TOMORROW.

256
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,361
IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN COME BY

257
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:03,763
IF YOU'D LIKE.

258
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,364
OKAY.

259
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,366
GREAT.

260
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,567
GREAT.

261
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,169
ALL RIGHT.

262
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,370
SO, I'LL, UH...

263
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,372
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

264
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,573
OKAY. BYE.

265
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:19,779
OH, GOD. OH, GOD. OH, GOD. OH, GOD.

266
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,080
OH...

267
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,682
SO HOW'S MINDY?

268
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,984
OH, SHE WANTS TO SEE ME TOMORROW.

269
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,585
OH, SHE SOUNDED REALLY WEIRD.

270
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,187
I GOT TO CALL BARRY.

271
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,393
HI. IT'S ME.

272
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,995
MINDY!

273
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:40,599
MINDY, HI! NO, I FIGURED THAT'S WHERE YOU'D BE.

274
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,713

275
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,519
HELL IS FILLED WITH PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

276
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,324
HE'S BACK. THE PEEPER'S BACK.

277
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:07,126
GET DOWN!

278
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,627
GET DOWN?

279
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:10,329
AND BOOGIE.

280
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,733
THANKS, BUT I GOT TO GO TO WORK

281
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,835
AND GET MY EYES SCRATCHED OUT BY MINDY.

282
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,436
RELAX. YOU KNOW, SHE MAY NOT EVEN KNOW.

283
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,139
PLEASE, I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HER IN SEVEN MONTHS

284
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,340
AND NOW SHE CALLS ME.

285
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,942
I MEAN, WHAT ELSE IS IT ABOUT?

286
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,745
SHE WAS MY BEST FRIEND, YOU GUYS.

287
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,046
WE WENT TO CAMP TOGETHER.

288
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,048
SHE TAUGHT ME HOW TO KISS.

289
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,649
YEAH?

290
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,954
NOW, YOU KNOW, I'M LIKE THE OTHER WOMAN.

291
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,956
OH, I FEEL SO...

292
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,357
NAUGHTY.

293
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,360
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

294
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,962
WHOA, HOLD UP. I'LL WALK OUT WITH YOU.

295
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,765
NOW, RACH, WHEN SHE TAUGHT YOU TO KISS, YOU WERE AT CAMP

296
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,767
AND WERE YOU WEARING ANY KIND OF LITTLE UNIFORM...?

297
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,372
THAT'S FINE, YEAH.

298
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,974
OKAY, I'M GOING TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

299
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,175
WILL YOU WATCH MY PHONE?

300
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,177
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TAKE IT WITH YOU?

301
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,279
HEY, WE HAVEN'T BEEN ON A SECOND DATE.

302
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,881
SHE NEEDS TO HEAR ME PEE?

303
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,883
WHY DON'T YOU JUST CALL HER?

304
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:04,683
I CAN'T CALL HER.

305
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:05,885
I LEFT A MESSAGE.

306
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,086
I HAVE SOME PRIDE.

307
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:07,887
DO YOU?

308
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:08,287
NO.

309
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,396
DANIELLE? HI.

310
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,098
HI, IT'S UH... IT'S CHANDLER.

311
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,699
I'M FINE.

312
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:21,901

313
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,502
UH, LISTEN.

314
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,905
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU TRIED TO CALL ME

315
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,506
BECAUSE, IDIOT THAT I AM

316
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:31,911
I ACCIDENTALLY SHUT OFF MY PHONE.

317
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,512
OH, OKAY. THAT'S FINE.

318
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:34,713
THAT'S GREAT.

319
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,116
OKAY.

320
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,717
SHE'S ON THE OTHER LINE.

321
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,120
SHE'S GOING TO CALL ME BACK.

322
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,122
? SHE'S ON THE OTHER LINE, SHE'S GONNA CALL ME BACK ?

323
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,124
? SHE'S ON THE OTHER LINE, GONNA CALL ME BACK ?

324
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,525
DON'T YOU HAVE TO PEE?

325
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,326
WHY I'M DANCING.

326
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:53,732
MINDY.

327
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,234
HEY, YOU.

328
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,836
HEY, YOU.

329
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,441
SO WHAT'S UP?

330
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:06,045
UM, WE SHOULD REALLY BE SITTING FOR THIS.

331
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,246
HMM.

332
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,447
SURE WE SHOULD.

333
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:18,657
SO...

334
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,860
OKAY, I'M JUST GOING TO ASK YOU THIS ONCE

335
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,262
AND I WANT A STRAIGHT ANSWER, NOT LIKE THE TIME

336
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,664
WHEN I ASKED YOU IF THOSE RED CAPRI PANTS

337
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,967
MADE MY ASS LOOK BIG.

338
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,368
I KNOW THINGS HAVE BEEN WEIRD LATELY

339
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,770
BUT YOU'RE, LIKE, MY OLDEST FRIEND IN THE WORLD

340
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,173
EXCEPT FOR MAYBE LORI SCHAEFFER, WHO I DON'T TALK TO ANYMORE

341
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,976
BECAUSE SHE'S ALL BITTER NOW THAT SHE'S LOST THE WEIGHT

342
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,178
AND IT TURNS OUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE A PRETTY FACE.

343
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,579
SO, OKAY, I'M JUST GOING TO SAY IT.

344
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,081
OKAY.

345
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,282

346
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:46,085
WILL YOU BE MY MAID OF HONOR?

347
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,290
OF COURSE!

348
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,191
OH, THAT'S SO GREAT!

349
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,093

350
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,595
IS THAT ALL YOU WANTED TO ASK ME?

351
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:57,796
THAT'S ALL!

352
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:01,600

353
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,602
WHAT?

354
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:04,803
THAT'S NOT ALL.

355
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,206
OH, SURE IT IS!

356
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,608
OH, NO, IT ISN'T, NO!

357
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:13,812
I THINK BARRY IS SEEING SOMEONE IN THE CITY.

358
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:17,316
OH, WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU THINK THAT?

359
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,318
WELL, EVER SINCE WE ANNOUNCED THE ENGAGEMENT

360
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,320
HE'S BEEN ACTING REALLY WEIRD

361
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,123
AND THEN LAST NIGHT HE CAME HOME

362
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,025
SMELLING LIKE CHANEL.

363
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,626
REALLY!

364
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,829
MINDY, IF IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL ANY BETTER

365
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,232
WHEN BARRY AND I FIRST GOT ENGAGED

366
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,634
HE WENT THROUGH A WHOLE WEIRD THING TOO.

367
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,937
OH, GOD, YOU SEE, THAT'S WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF.

368
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,638
WHAT? WHAT'S WHAT YOU WERE AFRAID OF?

369
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:40,839
OKAY, OKAY.

370
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:47,246
WHEN BARRY WAS ENGAGED TO YOU, HE AND I

371
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:51,250
KIND OF... HAD A LITTLE THING ON THE SIDE.

372
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,052
WHAT?

373
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,453
I KNOW, I KNOW.

374
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,855
AND WHEN HE PROPOSED TO ME, EVERYONE SAID, "DON'T DO IT.

375
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:59,658
HE'S JUST GOING TO DO TO YOU WHAT HE DID TO RACHEL"

376
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:00,859
AND NOW I FEEL SO STUPID.

377
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,062

378
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,263
HMM.

379
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,866
OH, MINDY. OH, YOU ARE SO STUPID.

380
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,671
OH, WE ARE BOTH SO STUPID.

381
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,273
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

382
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,776
SMELL FAMILIAR?

383
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,278
OH, NO.

384
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,481
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

385
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,183
OH, NO, ME.

386
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,784
IAM SO SORRY.

387
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:26,986
NO, I AM SORRY.

388
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,788

389
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,102
OH, MY.

390
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:48,307
FOUR LETTERS, "CIRCLE OR HOOP."

391
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,808
RING, DAMN IT. RING!

392
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,511
THANKS.

393
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:56,015
HEY, YOU KNOW OUR PHONE'S NOT WORKING?

394
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,417
WHAT?

395
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,319
I TRIED TO CALL YOU FROM THE COFFEE SHOP.

396
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,520
THERE WAS NO ANSWER.

397
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,122
I TURNED IT OFF.

398
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,325
MOTHER OF GOD, I TURNED IT OFF!

399
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,926
JUST LIKE YOU TOLD HER YOU DID.

400
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,530
JUST POINTING OUT THE IRONY.

401
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,834
HEY, SO LISTEN, I WENT ACROSS THE STREET AND TALKED TO THE DOORMAN.

402
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,236
I GOT THE PEEPER'S NAME.

403
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,937
CAN I USE THE PHONE?

404
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,139

405
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,741
CAN I USE YOUR PHONE?

406
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:29,148
YEAH, THE NUMBER FOR A SYDNEY MARKS, PLEASE.

407
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,649
"HEATING DEVICE."

408
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,052
RADIATOR.

409
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,653
FIVE LETTERS.

410
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,456
RDTOR.

411
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,962
YEAH, IS SYDNEY THERE?

412
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,564
OH, THIS IS?

413
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,666
SYDNEY'S A WOMAN.

414
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,268
SO SHE'S A WOMAN? SO WHAT?

415
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,769
YEAH, YEAH. SO WHAT?

416
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,172
LOOK, I LIVE ACROSS THE STREET, AND I KNOW

417
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:56,275
ALL ABOUT YOU AND YOUR LITTLE TELESCOPE

418
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,876
AND I DON'T APPRECIATE IT, OKAY?

419
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:01,080
YEAH, I CAN SEE YOU RIGHT NOW. HELLO!

420
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,683
IF I WANT TO WALK AROUND MY APARTMENT IN MY UNDERWEAR

421
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:05,884
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO FEEL...

422
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,486
THANK YOU.

423
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,291
THAT'S NOT REALLY THE POINT.

424
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,492
THE POINT IS THAT...

425
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,494
MOSTLY FREE WEIGHTS, BUT OCCASIONALLY...

426
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,496
JOEY!

427
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,299
YEAH, MY NEIGHBOR.

428
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,201
YEAH, THE BRUNETTE.

429
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,003
SHE SAID YOU LOOKED VERY PRETTY THE OTHER DAY

430
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,205
IN THE GREEN DRESS.

431
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,607
THE GREEN DRESS?

432
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,808
REALLY?

433
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,311
SHE SAID YOU LOOKED LIKE

434
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:33,912
INGRID BERGMAN THAT DAY.

435
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,514
NO.

436
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,320
DID DID SHE MENTION ME?

437
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,323
SHE WANTS TO KNOW WHY YOU TIE THE TOWEL AROUND YOUR HEAD.

438
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,827
IT'S A LEAVE IN CONDITIONER, OKAY?

439
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,431
IT'S A LEAVE IN CONDITIONER.

440
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,734

441
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:56,535
HEY.

442
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:57,736
HEY.

443
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:58,537
GOT A SECOND?

444
00:18:58,937 --> 00:18:59,738
SURE, SURE.

445
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,340
COME ON...

446
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,641
IN.

447
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,443
HELLO, SWEETHEART.

448
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,745
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

449
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:10,048
WE ARE HERE TO BREAK UP WITH YOU.

450
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,451
BOTH OF YOU?

451
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,853
BASICALLY, WE THINK YOU'RE A HORRIBLE HUMAN BEING

452
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,855
AND BAD THINGS SHOULD HAPPEN TO YOU.

453
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,859
I'M SORRY. GOD, I AM SO SORRY.

454
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,461
I'M AN IDIOT. I WAS WEAK.

455
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,662
I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF.

456
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:27,866
WHATEVER I DID I ONLY DID BECAUSE I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

457
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:32,471
WHICH ONE OF US ARE YOU TALKING TO THERE, BAR?

458
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,675
MINDY.

459
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,076
MINDY, OF COURSE, MINDY.

460
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,678
IT WAS ALWAYS MINDY.

461
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,080
EVEN WHEN WE WERE HAVING SEX IN THAT CHAIR?

462
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,084
I SWEAR. WHATEVER I WAS DOING, I WAS ALWAYS THINKING OF YOU.

463
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,886
OH, PLEASE. THAT SECOND TIME

464
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:51,089
YOU COULDN'T HAVE PICKED HER OUT OF A LINEUP.

465
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,791
YOU DID IT TWICE?

466
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,194
THE FIRST TIME DIDN'T REALLY COUNT.

467
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,695
YOU KNOW, IT WAS BARRY.

468
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,297
RIGHT.

469
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,299
HONEY, BABY, SWEETHEART, LOOK

470
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,701
JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE, OKAY?

471
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:03,602
WE'LL START OVER AGAIN.

472
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,604
WE'LL GO BACK TO ARUBA.

473
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,306
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU AND ARUBA?

474
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:10,509
I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE LIKE A DEAL WITH THE AIRLINES?

475
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,110
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

476
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,513
Dr. Farber, we've got an emergency here.

477
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:18,116
Jason Costellana is choking on his retainer.

478
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,318
OH, GOD.

479
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,919
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE, BERNICE.

480
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,722
LOOK, PLEASE... PLEASE DON'T GO ANYWHERE, OKAY?

481
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,724
I I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

482
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,925
OKAY.

483
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:30,529
OKAY, AND WE'LL BE HERE, HATING YOU.

484
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,732
DID YOU SEE HOW HE WAS SWEATING WHEN HE WALKED OUT OF HERE?

485
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,733
LISTEN, HONEY

486
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,134
IF I'M HOGGING THE BALL TOO MUCH

487
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,937
YOU JUST JUMP RIGHT IN THERE AND TAKE A COUPLE OF PUNCHES

488
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,939
BECAUSE I'M TELLING YOU, THIS FEELS GREAT.

489
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:44,843
YEAH. I'M PRETTY SURE I'M STILL GOING TO MARRY HIM.

490
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,046
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

491
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:51,250
MINDY, THE GUY IS THE DEVIL.

492
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,652
HE IS SATAN IN A SMOCK.

493
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,455
LOOK, I KNOW HE'S NOT PERFECT...

494
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,557
MM HMM.

495
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:02,961
BUT THE TRUTH IS AT THE END OF THE DAY, I...

496
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:08,567
I STILL REALLY WANT TO BE "MRS. DR. BARRY FARBER...

497
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,370
D.D.S."

498
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,372
DEAR GOD.

499
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:16,975
I HOPE YOU CAN FIND SOME WAY TO BE HAPPY FOR ME

500
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,778
AND I HOPE YOU'LL STILL BE MY MAID OF HONOR.

501
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:24,182
AND I HOPE BARRY DOESN'T KILL YOU AND EAT YOU IN ARUBA.

502
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,991
YOU OKAY?

503
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,993
YEAH.

504
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,995
REALLY?

505
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,196
YEAH.

506
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:41,400
YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE I RAN OUT ON BARRY AT THE WEDDING

507
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,003
I HAVE WONDERED WHETHER I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE

508
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,406
AND NOW I KNOW.

509
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,408
OH, I'M SO GLAD.

510
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,615
BIG DAY.

511
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,324
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GIVE YOU THIS.

512
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,326
MR. PEANUTISA BETTER DRESSER.

513
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,927
I MEAN, HE'S GOT THE MONOCLE.

514
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,929
HE'S GOT THE TOP HAT.

515
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,931
DID YOU KNOW HE'S GAY?

516
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,336
I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THIS.

517
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,138
ARE YOU OUTING MR. PEANUT?

518
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,740
CHANDLER?

519
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,642
DANIELLE, HI.

520
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,644
UH, EVERYBODY, THIS IS DANIELLE.

521
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,845
DANIELLE, EVERYBODY.

522
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,046
 HI.

523
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,147
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

524
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,550
WELL, I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU, BUT IT TURNS OUT

525
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,751
I HAD YOUR NUMBER WRONG

526
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,353
AND WHEN I FINALLY GOT THE RIGHT ONE

527
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,355
FROM INFORMATION THERE WAS NO ANSWER.

528
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,558
SO I THOUGHT I'D JUST COME DOWN HERE AND MAKE SURE YOU WERE OKAY.

529
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:42,761
OH. UH... I I'M OKAY.

530
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,163
LISTEN, UH, MAYBE WE COULD GET TOGETHER LATER?

531
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,064
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

532
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,467
I'LL CALL YOU, OR YOU CALL ME. WHATEVER.

533
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,668
YOU GOT IT.

534
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:52,671
BYE, EVERYBODY.

535
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:53,472
BYE. BYE. BYE.

536
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,175
WOO HOO! THERE YOU GO.

537
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,777
SECOND DATE.

538
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,379
I DON'T KNOW.

539
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,381
YOU DON'T KNOW?

540
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,082
OH, SHE SEEMS VERY NICE AND EVERYTHING

541
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,885
BUT THAT THING ABOUT HER COMING ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE

542
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,387
JUST TO SEE IF I WAS OKAY?

543
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,588
I MEAN, HOW NEEDY IS THAT?
