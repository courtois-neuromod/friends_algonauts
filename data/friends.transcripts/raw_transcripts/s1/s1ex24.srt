HOW CAN SHE DO THAT

147
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,614
WHEN SHE'S NEVER SHOWN ANY INTEREST IN YOU?

148
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,315
FORGET ABOUT HER.

149
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,017

00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:47,567
LIKE THE THREE MUSKETEERS, ONLY WITH FRUIT.

166
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,770
OH.

167
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:52,772
OKAY.

168
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,975
HOW DOES EVERYBODY LIKE THEIR BURGERS?

169
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,777
OH, NO, NO, PRESENTS FIRST, FOOD LATER.

170
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,880
I DON'T CARE WHAT RACHEL SAYS, WE'RE DOING PRESENTS FIRST.

171
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,083
HEY, HOLD  ON THERE, TIGER.

00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,288
SHE DEFINITELY THINKS TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT

175
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,290
WE'RE GOING TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION

176
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,492
IF YOU KNOW WHAT...

177
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,794
AND YOU DO.

178
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:18,798
SO HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT BEING THERE FOR HER?

179
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,399
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

180
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,206
YOU KNOW, JUST BE THERE FOR HER.

181
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,011

IT RATTLES.

189
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,840

00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,059
OH, IT'S DR. SEUSS!

196
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,564
THAT BOOK GOT ME THROUGH SOME TOUGH TIMES.

197
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,868
THERE IS A LITTLE CHILD INSIDE THIS MAN.

198
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:32,071
YES. THE DOCTORS SAY IF THEY REMOVE IT

199
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,973
HE'LL DIE.

200
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,174
WHO'S THIS FROM?

201
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,176
OH, THAT'S ROSS'S.

202
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:37,977
OH.

203
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,685
OH, MY GOD.

204
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,587
HE REMEMBERED.

205
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,988
REMEMBERED WHAT?

206
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:49,989
IT WAS, LIKE, MONTHS AGO.

207
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,391
WE WERE WALKING BY THIS ANTIQUE STORE

208
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,794
AND I SAW THIS PIN IN THE WINDOW

209
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,196
AND I TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS JUST LIKE ONE

210
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,999
MY GRANDMOTHER HAD WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

211
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,001
OH! I CAN'T BELIEVE HE REMEMBERED.

212
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,605
WELL, SURE, BUT CAN YOU PLAY IT ON A PLANE?

213
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,409
IT'S SO PRETTY.

214
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,312
THIS MUST HAVE COST HIM A FORTUNE.

215
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:16,115
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE DID THIS.

216
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,117
COME ON, ROSS? YOU REMEMBER BACK IN COLLEGE

217
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,519
WHEN HE FELL IN LOVE WITH CAROL AND BOUGHT HER

218
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,922
THAT RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE CRYSTAL DUCK?

219
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,523
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

220
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,932

221
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,137
CRYSTAL DUCK.

222
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,745
NO, NO, NO.

223
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,547
THE, UM... THE LOVE PART?

224
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,751
FOR... FLANIN...

225
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,757
OH, MY GOD!

226
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,160
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

227
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,963
THAT'S GOOD. JUST KEEP RUBBING YOUR HEAD.

228
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,766
THAT WILL TURN BACK TIME.

229
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,273
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

230
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,275
I MEAN, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

231
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,978
I KNOW. THIS IS REALLY, REALLY HUGE.

232
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,179
NO, IT'S NOT.

233
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,380
IT'S SMALL. IT'S TINY.

234
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,783
IT'S PETITE. IT'S WEE.

235
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,085
UH UH. I DON'T THINK ANY OF OUR LIVES

236
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,888
ARE EVER GOING TO BE THE SAME EVER AGAIN.

237
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,892
IS THERE A MUTE BUTTON ON THIS WOMAN?

238
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,894
I THINK THIS IS SO GREAT.

239
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,495
I MEAN, YOU AND ROSS!

240
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,097
DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA?

241
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,699
NO. NONE.

242
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,501
I MEAN, MY FIRST NIGHT IN THE CITY HE MENTIONED

243
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,103
SOMETHING ABOUT ASKING ME OUT

244
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,105
BUT NOTHING EVER HAPPENED SO I JUST...

245
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,707
WELL, WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY?

246
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,709
I MEAN, DOES HE, LIKE, WANT TO GO OUT WITH ME?

247
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,111
WELL, GIVEN THAT HE'S DESPERATELY IN LOVE WITH YOU

248
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,113
HE PROBABLY WOULDN'T MIND GETTING A CUP

249
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,815
OF COFFEE OR SOMETHING.

250
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,416
ROSS?

251
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,018
ALL THIS TIME?

252
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,020
WELL, I'VE GOT TO TALK TO HIM.

253
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,221
HE'S IN CHINA!

254
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,422
THE COUNTRY.

255
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,028
WELL, DID HIS FLIGHT LEAVE YET?

256
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,229
ARE YOU KIDDING?

257
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,231
HE'S AT HIS SEAT WATCHING A WOMAN DO THIS...

258
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,432
HE'S GONE.

259
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:14,633
NO, NO, WAIT.

260
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,235
HIS FLIGHT DOESN'T LEAVE FOR ANOTHER 45 MINUTES.

261
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:17,136
WHAT ABOUT THE TIME DIFFERENCE?

262
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,138
FROM HERE TO THE AIRPORT?

263
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:20,740
YES!

264
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,742
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO MAKE IT.

265
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,343
WELL, I'VE GOT TO TRY.

266
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,444
RACHEL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY TO HIM?

267
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,146
I I I DON'T KNOW.

268
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,748
WELL, THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T GO.

269
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,349
HE'S RIGHT, BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING

270
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,550
TO JUST, LIKE, BREAK HIS HEART

271
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,152
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT CAN WAIT.

272
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,554
YEAH, BUT IF IT'S GOOD NEWS, YOU SHOULD TELL HIM NOW.

273
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,056
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE I'LL KNOW WHEN I SEE HIM.

274
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,758
HERE, LOOK.

275
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,160
ALL RIGHT. DOES THIS HELP?

276
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,967
NO...

277
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,369
LOOK, ALL I KNOW IS THAT I CANNOT WAIT A WEEK UNTIL I SEE HIM.

278
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,971
I MEAN, THIS IS JUST TOO BIG.

279
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,373
YOU KNOW, I'VE JUST GOT... I'VE JUST TO TALK TO HIM.

280
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,975
I'VE GOT TO... OKAY. I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

281
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,277
RACHEL, I LOVE YOU!

282
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,879
DEAL WITH ME FIRST!

283
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,588
ZAI JIAN.

00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,991

285
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,392

287
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,597
ROSS!

288
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,199
ROSS!

289
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,400
PARDON ME! HI.

290
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,601
MAY I SEE YOUR BOARDING PASS?

291
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,402
NO, NO, I DON'T HAVE ONE.

292
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,603
I JUST NEED TO TALK TO MY FRIEND.

293
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,605
OH, I'M SORRY. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED ON THE JETWAY

294
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,008
UNLESS YOU HAVE A BOARDING PASS.

295
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,010
I KNOW, BUT HE JUST WENT ON. HE'S RIGHT THERE.

296
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,211
HE'S GOT THE BLUE JACKET ON.

297
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,613
I'M SORRY. FEDERAL REGULATIONS.

298
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:35,514
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

299
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:36,715
THEN COULD YOU PLEASE

300
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,717
JUST GIVE HIM A MESSAGE FOR ME?

301
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,319
PLEASE? THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

302
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,122
ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S THE MESSAGE?

303
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,224
I DON'T KNOW.

304
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,228
EXCUSE ME. SIR! SIR!

305
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,429
EXCUSE ME. SIR!

306
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,431
I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU.

307
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,632
WHAT?

308
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:54,834
IT'S FROM RACHEL.

309
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,836
SHE SAID THAT SHE LOVED THE PRESENT

310
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,238
AND SHE'LL SEE YOU WHEN YOU GET BACK.

311
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,840
TOBY, OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

312
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,242
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.

313
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:04,443
THERE'S NO RACHEL!

314
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,246
DON'T GIVE ME THAT DEEP FREEZE.

315
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,455
MMM...

316
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:20,860
OH, JOEY, JOEY, JOEY.

317
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,264
I THINK I BLACKED OUT THERE FOR A MINUTE.

318
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,866
IT WAS NOTHING.

319
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,868
WELL, NOW WE'VE GOT

320
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,071
TO FIND SOMETHING FUN FOR YOU.

321
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,272

322
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,274

323
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,876
UH... YOU KNOW WHAT?

324
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,078
FORGET ABOUT ME.

325
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,279
LET'S, UH...

326
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,281
LET'S GIVE YOU ANOTHER TURN.

327
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,285
ME AGAIN?

328
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,687
SURE! WHY NOT?

329
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:56,295
BOY! SOMEBODY'S GOING TO GET A BIG FRUIT BASKET TOMORROW.

330
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,601
OH! I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, JOEY

331
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,804
YOU ARE NOTHING LIKE I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE.

332
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,006
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

333
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,008
I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS I JUST HAD YOU PEGGED

334
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:12,211
AS ONE OF THOSE GUYS WHO ARE ALWAYS "ME, ME, ME."

335
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,812
BUT YOU...

336
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,215
YOU'RE A GIVER.

337
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,418
YOU'RE, LIKE, THE MOST GENEROUS MAN I'VE EVER MET.

338
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,020
I MEAN...

339
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,622
YOU'RE PRACTICALLY A WOMAN.

340
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,431
YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT.

341
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,748
SO?

342
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:50,749
I MISSED HIM.

343
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,351
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

344
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,953
THAT'S TOO BAD.

345
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:54,753
YEAH, RIGHT.

346
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:58,657
NO, I FEEL BAD FOR HER, I REALLY DO.

347
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,460
I CAN THINK OF SOMEBODY OTHER THAN MYSELF.

348
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,862
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO BED.

349
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,666
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, RACH, HANG IN THERE.

350
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,267
THANKS.

351
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,570
YES!

352
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,174
PIZZA COUPONS.

353
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,878
WELL, GOD.

354
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:23,482
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS WANT HELP CLEANING UP WITH THIS MESS HERE?

355
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,084
YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT.

356
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,489
UH, SO, UH, RACH

357
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,491
YOU WANT TO SAVE THIS WRAPPING PAPER?

358
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,293
I MEAN, IT'S ONLY A LITTLE BIT TORN.

359
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,695
SO ARE YOU GOING TO GO FOR IT WITH ROSS

360
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:39,698
OR SHOULD I JUST THROW IT OUT?

361
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,900
I DON'T KNOW.

362
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,303
I DON'T KNOW.

363
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,705
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT ALL THE WAY THERE

364
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,108
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT IT ALL THE WAY BACK.

365
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,910
AND, UH, OH, YOU GUYS, YOU KNOW, IT'S ROSS.

366
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,512
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

367
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,713
I MEAN, IT'S ROSS.

368
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,715
SURE. SURE.

369
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,017
I DON'T KNOW.

370
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,620
I MEAN, THIS IS JUST MY INITIAL GUT FEELING...

371
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,222

372
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,423
BUT I'M THINKING...

373
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,425
I'M THINKING IT'D BE REALLY GREAT.

374
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,027
OH, MY GOD, ME, TOO!

375
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,429
WE'LL BE LIKE FRIENDS IN LAW.

376
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,232
YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEST PART IS?

377
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,534
THE BEST PART IS THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM.

378
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,136
IT'S LIKE STARTING ON THE 15th DATE.

379
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,637
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW.

380
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,639
IT WOULD BE LIKE STARTING ON THE 15th DATE.

381
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,442
ANOTHER GOOD POINT.

382
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,044
NO. I MEAN...

383
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,046
WHEN YOU'RE AT THE 15th DATE

384
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,249
YOU'RE ALREADY IN A VERY RELATIONSHIPPY PLACE.

385
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,450
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE COMMITTED.

386
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,553
HUH?

387
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,056
WELL, I MEAN, THEN WHAT HAPPENS IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT?

388
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,657
WHY ISN'T IT WORKING OUT?

389
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,459
I DON'T KNOW, SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T.

390
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,061
IS HE NOT CUTE ENOUGH FOR YOU?

391
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,463
DOES HE NOT MAKE ENOUGH MONEY?

392
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,564
NO. I'M JUST...

393
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,765
MAYBE THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE.

394
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,767
WHA... IS THERE?

395
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,369
IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE?

396
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,371
NO! THERE IS NO ONE ELSE!

397
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,373
THEN WHY THE HELL ARE YOU DUMPING MY BROTHER?

398
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,575
WELL...

399
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,285
HEY, BIG...

400
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,486
SHH!

401
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:08,687
SPENDER.

402
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,092
SHE'S STILL ASLEEP.

403
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,293
SO, HOW'D IT GO?

404
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:15,894
IT WAS AMAZING.

405
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,197
YOU KNOW HOW YOU ALWAYS THINK YOU'RE GREAT IN BED?

406
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,499
THE FACT THAT YOU'D EVEN ASK THAT QUESTION

407
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,101
SHOWS HOW LITTLE YOU KNOW ME.

408
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,103
WELL, IT'S LIKE, LAST NIGHT

409
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,706
I COULDN'T DO THE THING THAT USUALLY MAKES ME GREAT.

410
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,708
SO I HAD TO DO ALL THIS OTHER STUFF

411
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,911
AND THE RESPONSE I GOT-- MAN, OH, MAN!

412
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,314
IT WAS LIKE A TICKER TAPE PARADE.

413
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,915
YES, I KNOW.

414
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,117
AS IT HAPPENS, MY ROOM

415
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,919
IS VERY, VERY CLOSE TO THE PARADE ROUTE.

416
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,726
IT WAS AMAZING.

417
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,228
AND NOT JUST FOR HER, UH UH.

418
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,429
FOR ME, TOO.

419
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,632
IT'S LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN, I'M BLIND.

420
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,034
BUT ALL MY OTHER SENSES ARE HEIGHTENED, YOU KNOW?

421
00:18:56,034 --> 00:19:00,038
IT'S LIKE I WAS ABLE TO APPRECIATE IT

422
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,441
ON ANOTHER LEVEL.

423
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:07,246
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD ANOTHER LEVEL.

424
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,648
I KNOW. NEITHER DID I.

425
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,652
HEY, IS SOMETHING GOING ON WITH OJ?

426
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:24,963
HEY, GREAT SKIRT!

427
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,165
BIRTHDAY PRESENT?

428
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,166
YEAH.

429
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,367
WELL, FROM WHO?

430
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,569
FROM YOU-- I EXCHANGED THE BLOUSE

431
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,571
YOU GOT ME.

432
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,973
WELL, IT'S THE THOUGHT.

433
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:39,778
HEY, DOESN'T ROSS' FLIGHT GET IN IN A COUPLE OF HOURS...

434
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,380
AT GATE 27B?

435
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,382
UH, YEAH. UH, MONICA, YOU KNOW, HONEY

436
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,384
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT

437
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,786
AND I'VE DECIDED THIS WHOLE ROSS THING

438
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,388
IS JUST NOT A GOOD IDEA.

439
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,589
WHY?

440
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:51,790
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE

441
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,293
I WOULDN'T JUST BE GOING OUT WITH HIM

442
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,295
I WOULD BE GOING OUT WITH ALL OF YOU.

443
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,097
THERE WOULD JUST BE ALL THIS PRESSURE...

444
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,500
NO. NO PRESSURE! NO PRESSURE!

445
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,101
MONICA, NOTHING HAS EVEN HAPPENED YET

446
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,703
AND YOU ARE ALREADY SO...

447
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,405
I AM NOT "SO"!

448
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,208
OKAY. I WAS A TEENSY BIT WEIRD AT FIRST

449
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,610
BUT I'LL BE GOOD. I PROMISE.

450
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,212

451
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,413
OKAY?

452
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,016
WHO IS IT?

453
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,618
 It's me, Carl.

454
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,220
COME ON UP.

455
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,021
BEHIND MY BROTHER'S BACK?

456
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,325
IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF CRAZY THING

457
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,327
YOU WON'T BE HEARING FROM ME.

458
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,742
700 BUCKS!

459
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,344
ALL RIGHT! YOU DID IT!

460
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,945
DO WE HAVE ANY FRUIT?

461
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,550
MAN, HELL OF A TWO WEEKS, HUH?

462
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,151
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH?

463
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,153
I REALLY FEEL LIKE I LEARNED SOMETHING.

464
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,655
REALLY? SO YOU'RE GOING TO STICK WITH THIS

465
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:57,856
"IT'S ALL FOR HER" THING?

466
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,858
WHAT ARE YOU? CRAZY?

467
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,661
WHEN A BLIND MAN GETS HIS SIGHT BACK

468
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,464
DOES HE WALK AROUND LIKE THIS?

469
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:10,869
I'M JUST SAYING

470
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,672
IF I SEE ONE MORE PICTURE OF ED BEGLEY, JR.

471
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,674
IN THAT STUPID ELECTRIC CAR

472
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,276
I'M GOING TO SHOOT MYSELF!

473
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,278
I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG

474
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,881
I'M NOT AGAINST ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES PER SE.

475
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,083
IT'S JUST THAT GUY!

476
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:29,588
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D RATHER GO OUT WITH HIM THAN ME.

477
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,290
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.

478
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,292
I'M TRYING TO HAVE A DATE HERE.

479
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,894
FINE. JUST STOP THINKING ABOUT ME.

480
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,897

481
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,800
CAN'T DO IT, CAN YOU?

482
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,002
SO, I'M THINKING ABOUT YOU.

483
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:44,803
SO WHAT?

484
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:46,405
I DON'T GET IT.

485
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,407
WHAT DO YOU SEE IN THIS GUY, ANYWAY?

486
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:51,610
WELL, HE SEEMS TO BE A VERY NICE... GUY.

487
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,813
I MEAN, COME ON, BUDDY! GET A REAL CAR!

488
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,718
RACHEL, COME ON.

489
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,320
GIVE US A CHANCE.

490
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,322
ROSS, IT'S TOO HARD.

491
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,523
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA-- WHY?

492
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,925
BECAUSE IT MIGHT GET WEIRD FOR EVERYONE ELSE?

493
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,927
WHO CARES ABOUT THEM? THIS IS ABOUT US.

494
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:12,731
LOOK, I'VE BEEN IN LOVE WITH YOU SINCE, LIKE, THE NINTH GRADE.

495
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,333
ROSS, YOU'RE LIKE MY BEST FRIEND.

496
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,335
IF WE BROKE UP AND I LOST YOU...

497
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,536
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

498
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,538
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WE'RE GOING TO BREAK UP?

499
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,940
WELL, HAVE YOU BEEN INVOLVED WITH SOMEONE

500
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,942
WHERE YOU HAVEN'T BROKEN UP?

501
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,145
NO.

502
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,549
BUT IT ONLY HAS TO HAPPEN ONCE.

503
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,551
LOOK, YOU AND I BOTH KNOW

504
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,953
WE ARE PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER.

505
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,156
RIGHT? I MEAN, SO THE ONLY QUESTION IS

506
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,559
ARE YOU ATTRACTED TO ME?

507
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,862
I DON'T KNOW.

508
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:48,767
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER LOOKED AT YOU THAT WAY BEFORE.

509
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,169
WELL, START LOOKING.

510
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,781
WOW.

511
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,383
EXACTLY!

512
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,385
AND YOU JUST KNOW I'M GOING TO BE THE GUY

513
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,888
CAUGHT BEHIND THIS HAMMERHEAD IN TRAFFIC.

514
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,091
UH, RIGHT.

515
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,292
YOU'RE RIGHT.

516
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,494
YOU KNOW WHAT?

517
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:16,695
WHAT?

518
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,096
I FORGOT I'M SUPPOSED

519
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,098
TO PICK UP A FRIEND AT THE AIRPORT.

520
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:21,299
I AM SO SORRY.

521
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,903
SO, IF YOU WANT TO STAY AND FINISH YOUR DRINKS

522
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,505
PLEASE DO.

523
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,507
I'M SORRY. I'VE GOT TO GO. I'M SORRY.

524
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,709
BUT...

525
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:35,914
HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?

526
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:36,715
TO GET ROSS.

527
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,316
WHAT? OH, MY GOD!

528
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:39,518
THIS IS SO EXCITING!

529
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,019
YEAH, I KNOW.

530
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,822
MONICA, LISTEN, IF YOU WANT THE REST OF MY DATE

531
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,424
I'M NOT GOING TO FINISH IT.

532
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,426
RACHEL, HE'S NOT A SANDWICH.

533
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,829
NO, HE'S AN INVESTMENT BANKER WITH TICKETS TO THE OPERA.

534
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,831
HELLOOOO!

535
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:58,336
HEY, RACH, WHERE YOU GOING?

536
00:23:58,737 --> 00:23:59,538
AIRPORT.

537
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:00,739
OH, NO, NO, YOU CAN'T TELL HIM.

538
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,741
THERE'S SO MUCH STUFF I HAVEN'T DONE IN MY LIFE.

539
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:06,044
I HAVEN'T WATCHED BAYWATCH SINCE THEY BROUGHT ON YASMINE BLEETH.

540
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:09,247
OKAY, CHANDLER, RELAX.

541
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,650
THIS IS A GOOD GOING TO THE AIRPORT.

542
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,952
OH! OH, WELL, THEN FLY, GOOD WOMAN.

543
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:15,654
FLY LIKE THE WIND.

544
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:16,855
I'M FLYING.

545
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:19,257
DON'T FORGET TO TELL HIM I'M THE ONE WHO BLEW IT.

546
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:24,062
YES, ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL CASE FOR THE LOVE DOCTOR.

547
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,273
EXCUSE ME. PARDON ME.

548
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:36,875
EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME. SORRY.

549
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:40,879
TOBY, FOR GOD'S SAKE. WILL YOU LET IT GO?

550
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,481
THERE'S NO RACHEL!

551
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,283
EXCUSE ME. SORRY.

552
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,488
OH, HEY. HEY. I GOT THAT.

553
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,890
OH, THANKS. SWEETIE.

554
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,091
NO PROBLEM.

555
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,700
