I THINK I'M JUST GOING TO GO HOME

00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,641

101
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,043

00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,670
HI,ME.

120
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,273
I REMEMBER THE DAY

121
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,874
I GOT MY FIRST PAYCHECK.

122
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:38,278
THERE WAS A CAVE IN IN ONE OF THE MINES.

123
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,479

124
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,881

125
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,984

126
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,889
OH! ISN'T THIS EXCITING?

127
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,090
I EARNED THIS.

128
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,292
I WIPED TABLES FOR IT.

129
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,294
I STEAMED MILK FOR IT.

130
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,296
AND IT WAS TOTALLY...

131
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,497
NOT WORTH IT.

132
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,698
WHO'S "FICA"?

133
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,501
WHY'S HE GETTING ALL MY MONEY?

134
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,203

139
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,115
TOTALLY LIVE ON THIS.

00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,948
PEACH PIT.

191
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,349
YES, BUNNY?

192
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,052
PEACH PIT.

193
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,054
THAT NIGHT WE, UH, WE HAD...

194
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,155
PEACHES?

195
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,557
ACTUALLY, NECTARINES.

196
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,758
BUT, BASICALLY...

197
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:41,461
COULD HAVE BEEN A PEACH.

198
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,263
THEN WE, UH... THEN WE GOT DRESSED

199
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,066
AND I WALKED HER TO THE...

200
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,668
THE BUS STOP.

201
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,869

202
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,070
I'M FINE.

203
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,373
HEY, THAT WOMAN'S GOT AN ASS LIKE CAROL'S.

204
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,779
WHAT?

205
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,982
I THOUGHT WE WERE TRYING TO FIND STUFF.

206
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:06,786
COME ON, YOU GUYS, TELL ME ALL THE DIRT.

207
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,989
WELL, THE BIGGEST NEWS IS STILL YOU DUMPING BARRY

208
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,991
AT THE ALTAR.

209
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,994
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TALK REALITY FOR A SECOND.

210
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,996
WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME?

211
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,799
WHAT... I'M NOT.

212
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:23,002
COME ON, THIS IS US.

213
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,203
I'M NOT.

214
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,606
THIS IS WHAT I'M DOING NOW.

215
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,008
I'VE GOT THIS JOB, YOU KNOW?

216
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,610
I EVEN DO MY OWN LAUNDRY.

217
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,612

218
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,615
OOH!

219
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,017
THIS IS WHAT I'M DOING NOW.

220
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,218
WAITRESSING?

221
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:42,822
I'M NOT JUST WAITRESSING.

222
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:46,025
I MEAN... I, UM...

223
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:50,229
I WRITE THE SPECIALS ON THE SPECIALS BOARD

224
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,231
AND I... I, UH...

225
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:56,135
I TAKE THE DEAD FLOWERS OUT OF THE VASE

226
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,737
OH, AND SOMETIMES ARTURO

227
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,940
LETS ME PUT THE CHOCOLATE BLOBBIES ON THE COOKIES.

228
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,143
WELL, YOUR MOM DIDN'T TELL US ABOUT THE BLOBBIES.

229
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,356
 HOW WAS IT WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

230
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,458

231
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,864
OKAY, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE SOME TIKI DEATH PUNCH?

232
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,365
WHAT'S THAT?

233
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,967
WELL, IT'S RUM AND...

234
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:28,768
OKAY.

235
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,772
WE THOUGHT SINCE PHOEBE WAS STAYING OVER TONIGHT

236
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,174
WE'D HAVE KIND OF A SLUMBER PARTY THING.

237
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,475
WE GOT SOME TRASHY MAGAZINES

238
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,377
WE GOT COOKIE DOUGH, WE GOT "TWISTER"...

239
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,979

240
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,981
OH, AND I BROUGHT "OPERATION"

241
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,985
BUT I LOST THE TWEEZERS SO WE CAN'T OPERATE.

242
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,387
BUT WE CAN PREP THE GUY.

243
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,792
RACH, IT'S THE VISA CARD PEOPLE.

244
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,595
OH, GOD, ASK THEM WHAT THEY WANT.

245
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,797
COULD YOU PLEASE TELL ME WHAT THIS IS

246
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,799
IN REFERENCE TO?

247
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,301
YES... THEY SAY THERE'S BEEN SOME UNUSUAL ACTIVITY

248
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:03,903
ON YOUR ACCOUNT.

249
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,405
BUT I HAVEN'T USED MY CARD IN WEEKS.

250
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,107
THAT IS THE UNUSUAL ACTIVITY.

251
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,109
LOOK, THEY JUST WANT TO SEE

252
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,510
IF YOU'RE OKAY.

253
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,613
THEY WANT TO KNOW IF I'M OKAY.

254
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,015
OKAY, THEY WANT TO KNOW IF I'M OKAY.

255
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,216
OKAY, LET'S SEE...

256
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,419
WELL, THE FICA GUYS TOOK ALL MY MONEY.

257
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,822
EVERYONE I KNOW IS EITHER GETTING MARRIED

258
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,224
OR GETTING PREGNANT OR GETTING PROMOTED

259
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,027
AND I'M GETTING COFFEE, AND IT'S NOT EVEN FOR ME.

260
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,029
SO IF THAT SOUNDS LIKE I'M OKAY

261
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,431
THEN YOU CAN TELL THEM I'M OKAY. OKAY?

262
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:38,437
UH, RACHEL HAS LEFT THE BUILDING.

263
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,840
CAN YOU CALL BACK?

264
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,942
ALL RIGHT, COME ON...

265
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,545
LET'S PLAY "TWISTER."

266
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,350

267
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,952

268
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,455
SORRY... SORRY... SORRY.

269
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,057
UH OH.

270
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,059
WHAT?

271
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,862
THERE WAS ICE THERE THAT NIGHT WITH CAROL?

272
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,463
PLASTIC SEATS?

273
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,465
4,000 ANGRY PITTSBURGH FANS?

274
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:09,268
NO, ACTUALLY, I WAS JUST SAYING

275
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,671
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE NOT SITTING TOGETHER.

276
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,274
BUT NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT, THERE WAS ICE THERE THAT NIGHT.

277
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,677
IT WAS THE FIRST FROST.

278
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,878
WE WERE...

279
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,280
SIT, SIT... SIT DOWN, SIT.

280
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,682
YOU SHOULD FEEL GREAT ABOUT YOURSELF.

281
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,084
YOU'RE DOING THIS AMAZING INDEPENDENT THING.

282
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,687
MONICA, WHAT IS SO AMAZING?

283
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,089
I GAVE UP, LIKE, EVERYTHING.

284
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,691
AND FOR WHAT?

285
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,793
YOU ARE JUST LIKE JACK.

286
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,594
JACK FROM DOWNSTAIRS?

287
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:39,098
NO, JACK AND THE BEANSTALK.

288
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,200
AH, THE OTHER JACK.

289
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,001
YEAH, RIGHT.

290
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,703
SEE, HE GAVE UP SOMETHING

291
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,105
BUT THEN HE GOT THOSE MAGIC BEANS

292
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,907
AND THEN HE WOKE UP

293
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,310
AND THERE WAS THIS BIG PLANT OUTSIDE OF HIS WINDOW

294
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,713
FULL OF POSSIBILITIES AND STUFF

295
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,717
AND HE LIVED IN A VILLAGE, AND YOU LIVE IN THE VILLAGE...

296
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,819
OKAY, BUT PHEEBS, PHEEBS...

297
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,221
JACK GAVE UP A COW.

298
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,623
I GAVE UP AN ORTHODONTIST.

299
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,026
I KNOW I DIDN'T LOVE HIM.

300
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,929
SEE, JACK DID LOVE THE COW.

301
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,131
BUT, SEE, IT WAS A PLAN.

302
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:12,932
IT WAS CLEAR.

303
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,533
EVERYTHING WAS FIGURED OUT

304
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,535
AND NOW EVERYTHING'S KIND OF LIKE...

305
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:17,636
FLOOPY?

306
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,038
YEAH.

307
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,841
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE.

308
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,843
HALF THE TIME, WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING.

309
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,044
I MEAN, YOU JUST GOT TO FIGURE

310
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,046
AT SOME POINT, IT'S ALL GOING TO COME TOGETHER

311
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,148
AND IT'S JUST GOING TO BE... UN FLOOPY.

312
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,750
LIKE THAT'S A WORD.

313
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:37,556
BUT, MONICA, WHAT IF IT DOESN'T COME TOGETHER?

314
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,359
PHEEBS?

315
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:45,564
WELL, BECAUSE YOU JUST LIKE... I DON'T LIKE THIS QUESTION.

316
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,967
OKAY, SEE, SEE, YOU GUYS--

317
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,770
WHAT IF WE DON'T GET MAGIC BEANS?

318
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,373
WHAT IF ALL WE'VE GOT ARE... BEANS?

319
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:00,079
 GET HIM, GET HIM.

320
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,881
GET HIM, GET HIM.

321
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,082
YES!

322
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,083
YOU'RE NOT LAUGHING NOW

323
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,284
ARE YOU, PAL?

324
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,686
THAT'S ALL YOU NEEDED-- A BUNCH OF TOOTHLESS GUYS

325
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:08,888
HITTING EACH OTHER WITH STICKS

326
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,089
WELL, PASS IT!

327
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,490
PASS IT.

328
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,092
 HE'S OPEN.

329
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,093
SHOOT IT!

330
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:14,693
SHOOT IT!

331
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,796
SHOOT IT!

332
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,997
OHH...

333
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,202
HEY, LOOK, WE'RE ON THAT TV THING.

334
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,505
HEY, LOOK AT THAT, HEY!

335
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,515
EXCUSE ME.

336
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,117
IT SAYS TO CALL THIS NUMBER

337
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,119
IF YOU'RE NOT COMPLETELY SATISFIED

338
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,320
WITH THIS CANDY BAR.

339
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,722
WELL, I'M NOT COMPLETELY SATISFIED.

340
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,628
YEAH, WELL, THE LABEL PROMISES NUTTY GOODNESS.

341
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,030
LISTEN, IT'S KIND OF AN EMERGENCY.

342
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,631
WELL, I GUESS YOU'D KNOW THAT

343
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,233
OR WE'D BE IN THE PREDICAMENT ROOM.

344
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,335

345
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,736
HOLD ON.

346
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,539
FILL THESE OUT. SIT OVER THERE.

347
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,143
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE ANY TROUBLE

348
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,145
BUT I'M IN A LOT OF PAIN.

349
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,746
MY FACE IS DENTED.

350
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,448
YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT YOUR TURN.

351
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:10,950
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK

352
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,451
IT'LL BE?

353
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,053
ANY MINUTE NOW.

354
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:17,957
HEY, MISS...

355
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,758
UH...

356
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,064

357
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,669
OH...

358
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,671
I'M SO SORRY, YOU GUYS.

359
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,474
I DIDN'T MEAN TO BRING YOU DOWN.

360
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:39,578
NO, YOU WERE RIGHT-- I DON'T HAVE A PLAN.

361
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,381

362
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,983
PIZZA GUY!

363
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,584
OH, THANK GOD.

364
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:46,785
FOOD!

365
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:47,586
PHOEBE?

366
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:48,787
WHAT?

367
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,389
DO YOU HAVE A PLAN?

368
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,893
I DON'T EVEN HAVE A "PLA."

369
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,897
HI. ONE MUSHROOM, GREEN PEPPER AND ONION?

370
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:01,600
NO, NO... NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ORDERED!

371
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,405
WE ORDERED A FAT FREE CRUST WITH EXTRA CHEESE!

372
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:10,109
WAIT. YOU'RE NOT G. STEPHANOPOULOS?

373
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:13,712
MAN, MY DAD'S GOING TO KILL ME!

374
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,515
WAIT! DID YOU SAY G. STEPHANOPOULOS?

375
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,117
YEAH. THIS ONE GOES

376
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:19,718
ACROSS THE STREET.

377
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,121
I MUST HAVE GIVEN HIM YOURS.

378
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,322
BONEHEAD! BONEHEAD!

379
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,623
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU DO THAT

380
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,625
YOU'RE ONLY HITTING YOURSELF.

381
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,630
WAS THIS A SMALL MEDITERRANEAN GUY

382
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,033
WITH CURIOUSLY INTELLIGENT GOOD LOOKS?

383
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,335
YEAH. THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

384
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,438
WAS HE... WAS HE WEARING A STUNNING BLUE SUIT?

385
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,639
AND A POWER TIE?

386
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,342
NO. PRETTY MUCH JUST A TOWEL.

387
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,743
OH, GOD.

388
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,345
SO YOU GUYS WANT ME

389
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,646
TO TAKE THIS BACK?

390
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,048
WHAT? ARE YOU NUTS?

391
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,450
WE'VE GOT GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS' PIZZA!

392
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:53,953
HERE.

393
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,856
UH, PHEEBS...

394
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:01,360
WHO IS GEORGE SNUFFLEUPAGUS?

395
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,762
THAT'S BIG BIRD'S FRIEND.

396
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,167
I SEE PIZZA!

397
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,169
I WANT TO SEE! LET ME SEE!

398
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,471
HELLO? WHO ARE WE SPYING ON?

399
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,273
YOU KNOW THE WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR?

400
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,975
CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN GUY

401
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,578
GREAT HAIR, SEXY SMILE, REALLY CUTE BUTT?

402
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,981
OH, HIM! THE LITTLE GUY!

403
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,582
OH, I LOVE HIM!

404
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:24,683
UH, WAIT.

405
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,285
WAIT. I SEE A WOMAN.

406
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,287
TELL ME IT'S HIS MOTHER.

407
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,289
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT HIS MOTHER.

408
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,890
OH, NO...

409
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,892
WAIT. SHE'S WALKING ACROSS THE FLOOR.

410
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,295
SHE'S WALKING... SHE'S WALKING...

411
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,297
SHE'S GOING FOR THE PIZZA...

412
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:41,100
HEY, THAT'S NOT FOR YOU, BITCH!

413
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,515
EXCUSE ME. WE'VE BEEN HERE

414
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,716
OVER AN HOUR

415
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,718
AND PEOPLE LESS SICK THAN MY FRIEND

416
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,620
HAVE GONE IN.

417
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,323
I MEAN, THAT GUY WITH THE TOE THING?

418
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,524
WHO'S HE SLEEPING WITH?

419
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,329
OH, COME ON, DORA, DON'T BE MAD.

420
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,532
I KNOW WE BOTH SAID SOME THINGS WE...

421
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,134
DIDN'T MEAN, BUT...

422
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:19,138
THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE STILL DON'T LOVE EACH OTHER.

423
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,341
YOU KNOW, I... I FEEL LIKE I'VE LOST HER.

424
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,642
BAH!

425
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,246
COME ON, PUSH ME.

426
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,447
NO.

427
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,248
COME ON, PUSH ME.

428
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,250
NO. YOU'RE GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE.

429
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,052
DON'T BE A BABY. PUSH ME.

430
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,653
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

431
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,655
I'M GOING TO PUSH YOU, OKAY?

432
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,657
HOW ABOUT I PUSH YOU LIKE THIS?

433
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,060

434
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,661
YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN THE WHEELCHAIR

435
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:43,462
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

436
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:47,066
PALLY WALLY... WHA...

437
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,569
I'M SO VERY SORRY.

438
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,372
UH, CAN I... SIGN YOU?

439
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,176
LIGHTS STILL OUT?

440
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:57,976
YEAH.

441
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,978
WELL, MAYBE THEY'RE NAPPING.

442
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,980
OH, PLEASE.

443
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,582
THEY'RE HAVING SEX.

444
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,584
 SHUT UP!

445
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:12,491
SO... WHAT DO YOU THINK GEORGE IS LIKE?

446
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,093
I THINK

447
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,094
HE'S SHY.

448
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,595
YEAH?

449
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,599
I THINK YOU HAVE TO DRAW HIM OUT, AND THEN...

450
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,402
WHEN YOU DO, HE'S A PREPPY ANIMAL.

451
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,806
HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE GUYS ARE LIKE?

452
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:28,607
OUR GUYS?

453
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,209
YEAH, OUR GUYS.

454
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,009
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

455
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,211
I FEEL FUNNY TALKING ABOUT THAT.

456
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,412
OH, COME ON.

457
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,213
OKAY.

458
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,314
WELL, JOEY'S LIKE

459
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,915
ONE OF THOSE LITTLE KIDDIE RIDES

460
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,917
OUT IN FRONT OF A SUPERMARKET, YOU KNOW?

461
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,420
YOU JUST HAVE TO PUT THE QUARTER IN

462
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,621
AND IT JUST GOES.

463
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,822

464
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,023
 I DON'T KNOW.

465
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,226
I THINK HE MIGHT SURPRISE YOU.

466
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:50,028
ONE TIME HE WAS HELPING ME PUT ON MY COAT

467
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,630
AND HE WAS REALLY TENDER.

468
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,032
COME ON, BABY, COME ON...

469
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,634
LET'S GO...

470
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,636
YES!

471
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,340
 CHANDLER'S HARD TO READ.

472
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,941
HE'S, LIKE, ONE OF THOSE REPRESSED GUYS

473
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,143
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO SEDUCE.

474
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,744
I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE ACT.

475
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,346
I HAVE A FEELING THAT CHANDLER

476
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,348
IS A LOT MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN HE SEEMS.

477
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,854
YOU KNOW WHO'S KIND OF SEXY?

478
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,056
DON'T. ROSS.

479
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,959
NO. GUYS, PLEASE, HE IS MY BROTHER.

480
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,861
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN.

481
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,863
HE CAN BE REALLY SMOOTH.

482
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:38,677
GOD, CAN'T YOU JUST PICTURE HIM IN BED?

483
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,679
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO.

484
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,383
COME ON, LAUGH, LAUGH.

485
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,984
I REMEMBER THE MOONLIGHT

486
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,387
COMING IN THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW.

487
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,988
HER FACE HAD THE MOST

488
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,590
INCREDIBLE GLOW.

489
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,393
YES, THE MOON, THE GLOW, THE MAGICAL FEELING.

490
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:55,994
YOU DID THIS PART.

491
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,797
COULD I GET SOME PAINKILLERS OVER HERE, PLEASE?

492
00:19:58,797 --> 00:19:59,998
HE'S RIGHT.

493
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,600
ENOUGH ALREADY.

494
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,002
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL ABOUT TODAY?

495
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,104
SO YOU SLEPT WITH HER

496
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,106
FOR THE FIRST TIME-- SO WHAT?

497
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,308
YOU SLEPT WITH HER

498
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,809
FOR SEVEN YEARS AFTER THAT.

499
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,411
IT'S JUST A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED.

500
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:13,612
FOR WHAT, WHAT... WHAT IS IT?

501
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,614
THAT SHE LEFT YOU, THAT SHE LIKES WOMEN

502
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,417
THAT SHE LEFT YOU FOR ANOTHER WOMAN THAT LIKES WOMEN?

503
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,618
A LITTLE LOUDER, OKAY?

504
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,821
THERE'S A MAN ON THE 12th FLOOR IN A COMA

505
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,424
WHO DIDN'T QUITE HEAR YOU.

506
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,426
THEN WHAT?

507
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,229
MY FIRST TIME WITH CAROL WAS...

508
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,432
MY FIRST TIME.

509
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,235
WHAT?

510
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:43,041
IT WAS MY FIRST... TIME.

511
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,043
WITH CAROL?

512
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,251
OH...

513
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,253
SO IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE

514
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,055
YOU'VE ONLY BEEN WITH ONE... OH.

515
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:00,158
WHOA, BOY, HOCKEY WAS A BIG MISTAKE.

516
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:04,563
THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF WE COULD HAVE DONE TONIGHT.

517
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,267
OKAY, I GOT ONE.

518
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:13,071
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT VEGETARIAN PATE THAT I MADE

519
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,073
THAT YOU LOVED SO MUCH?

520
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:15,874
UH HUH.

521
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,376

522
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,679
WELL, UNLESS GOOSE IS A VEGETABLE...

523
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,781
OH! OH!

524
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,284
OKAY, FINE, FINE.

525
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,086
NOW I DON'T FEEL SO BAD ABOUT SLEEPING WITH JASON HURLEY.

526
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,589
WHAT?! YOU SLEPT WITH JASON?

527
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,591
YOU'D ALREADY BROKEN UP.

528
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,992
HOW LONG?

529
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:34,993
JUST A COUPLE HOURS.

530
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:38,196
OH, THAT'S NICE.

531
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,999
OKAY, OKAY, I GOT ONE.

532
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,404
ANYWAY, THE VALENTINE TOMMY ROLLERSON LEFT IN YOUR LOCKER

533
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,005
WAS REALLY FROM ME!

534
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:48,807
EXCUSE ME?

535
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,911
OH, HELLO? LIKE HE WAS REALLY GOING TO SEND YOU ONE.

536
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,716
SHE WAS A BIG GIRL.

537
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:02,120
REALLY? WELL, AT LEAST BIG GIRLS

538
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,524
DON'T PEE IN THEIR PANTS IN SEVENTH GRADE.

539
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,526
I WAS LAUGHING!

540
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:08,727
YOU MADE ME LAUGH!

541
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:09,728

542
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,330
THERE HE IS!

543
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,531
WHERE?

544
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,334
RIGHT WHERE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING ALL NIGHT.

545
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,535
OH, HE'S SO CUTE.

546
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,338
OH, GEORGE, BABY, DROP THE TOWEL!

547
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,740
DROP THE TOWEL. DROP THE TOWEL.

548
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,543
WOW! WOW! WOW!

549
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:31,049
MAN, CAN YOU BELIEVE HE'S ONLY HAD SEX

550
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,051
WITH ONE WOMAN?

551
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,454
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

552
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:38,657
YOU KNOW, IT'S SWEET, IT'S ROMANTIC...

553
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,059
REALLY?

554
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,661
NAH. YOU KIDDING?

555
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,663

570
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,800
FINDERS KEEPERS, LOSERS WEEPERS.

571
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,405

591
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,376
NOTHING. IT'S A TWISTER THING.

592
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:39,978
THE RULES ARE ON THE BACK OF THE BOX.

593
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,681

00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,082
