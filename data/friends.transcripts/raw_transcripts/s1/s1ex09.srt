TERRY, I I KNOW THAT I HAVEN'T WORKED HERE VERY LONG

2
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:12,412
BUT I WAS WONDERING, DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE

3
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:15,715
IF I GOT A HUNDRED DOLLAR ADVANCE ON MY SALARY?

4
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,317
AN ADVANCE?

5
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:20,520
IT'S SO THAT I CAN SPEND THANKSGIVING WITH MY FAMILY.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,922
SEE, EVERY YEAR WE GO SKIING IN VAIL

7
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:25,725

8
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:29,329

I WAS JUST WONDERING DO YOU THINK THERE'S A POSSIBILITY

39
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,720
THAT YOU COULD GIVE ME AN ADVANCE ON MY TIPS?

40
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,322

00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,124

OOH! OOH! WHY DON'T WE INVITE HER?

110
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,571

00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:14,514
YES, I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE CONCEPT.

126
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,115
WE CAN JUST LOOK FOR IT.

127
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:17,717

00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,366
THEY CAN HEAR SOUNDS IN THERE?

141
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,567
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

142
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,170
I MEAN, YOU... YOU REALLY... YOU REALLY TALK TO IT?

143
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,472

00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,914
I THINK THE BABY CAN TOTALLY HEAR EVERYTHING.

157
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,515

158
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:56,716

BUT YOU PUT YOUR HEAD INSIDE THIS TURKEY

161
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,622

162
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,624

FOR THANKSGIVING DINNER?

197
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,995
WH WHAT WHAT IS IT WITH YOU AND THIS HOLIDAY?

198
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,196

199
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,999
ALL RIGHT. I'M NINE YEARS OLD.

200
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,701
AW, I HATE THIS STORY.

201
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,303
WE'VE JUST FINISHED THIS MAGNIFICENT THANKSGIVING DINNER.

202
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,706
I HAVE AND I REMEMBER THIS PART VIVIDLY

203
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:27,907
A MOUTHFUL OF PUMPKIN PIE.

204
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,710
AND THIS IS THE MOMENT MY PARENTS CHOOSE TO TELL ME

205
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,311
THEY'RE GETTING DIVORCED.

206
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,913
OH, MY GOD.

207
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:37,116
YES, YES. VERY DIFFICULT TO ENJOY THANKSGIVING DINNER

208
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,718
ONCE YOU'VE SEEN IT

209
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:39,919
IN REVERSE.

210
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,522
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

211
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,723
WHAT'S THIS?

212
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,925
I NEVER SAW THIS AT MOM'S.

213
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,126
IT'S A YAM.

214
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,128
HEL LO.

215
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,730
THIS ISN'T A YAM.

216
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,533
YAM COMES IN THE PURPLE CANS.

217
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,136
THEY DON'T, THEY DON'T, THEY DON'T COME IN THESE.

218
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,140
OKAY, ROSS, DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY OR ANYTHING

219
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,341
BUT BACK OFF!

220
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,057
UH, HI.

221
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,059
WE, UH...

222
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,661
WE USED TO WORK TOGETHER.

223
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:22,662
WE DID?

224
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,863
YEAH. AT MACY'S.

225
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,865
YOU'RE THE "OBSESSION GIRL," RIGHT?

226
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,066
YES.

227
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,869
I WAS THE "ARAMIS GUY."

228
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,070
"ARAMIS...

229
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,271
"ARAMIS...

230
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:33,873
ARAMIS."

231
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,474
YEAH, RIGHT.

232
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:36,676
I GOT TO TELL YOU

233
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,678
YOU'RE THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS.

234
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:39,478
GET OUT.

235
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:40,680

00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,480
YOU'RE AMAZING.

237
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,482
YOU KNOW WHEN TO SPRITZ.

238
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,084
YOU KNOW WHEN TO LAY BACK.

239
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,887
REALLY? YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME.

240
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,289
  OOH. MMM.

LISTEN, UH, DO YOU WANT TO GO GET A DRINK OR SOMETHING?

245
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,510

I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

250
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:17,717
OH, WHAT?

251
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,119

264
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,065

265
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,868

266
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,470

267
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,672

SET ANOTHER PLACE FOR THANKSGIVING.

278
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,798
MY ENTIRE FAMILY THINKS

279
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,499
I HAVE V.D.

280
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:43,302
TONIGHT, ON A VERY SPECIAL BLOSSOM...

00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,213
MMM, LOOKING GOOD. OKAY.

282
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:58,617
CIDER'S MULLING, TURKEY'S TURKING, YAMS ARE YAMMING.

283
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:01,020
WHAT?

284
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,221
I DON'T KNOW.

285
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,024
IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME WITHOUT MOM IN THE KITCHEN.

286
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,525
OH... ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

287
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,527
YOU KNOW WHAT, JUST GET OUT OF MY WAY AND STOP ANNOYING ME.

288
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,630
OH, THAT'S CLOSER.

289
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,332
I GOT THE TICKET, I GOT THE TICKET!

290
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,334
FIVE HOURS FROM NOW...

291
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,737
SHOOP, SHOOP, SHOOP.

292
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,539
OH, YOU MUST STOP SHOOPING.

293
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,241
YEAH, I BETTER GET MY STUFF.

294
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,044
CHANDLER, WILL YOU JUST COME IN ALREADY?

295
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,145
OH, NO, THANK YOU.

296
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,948
I PREFER TO KEEP A SAFE DISTANCE FROM ALL THIS MERRIMENT.

297
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,449
LOOK OUT.

298
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,051
INCOMING PUMPKIN PIE.

299
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,652

300
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:40,459
OKAY, WE ALL LAUGHED WHEN YOU DID IT WITH THE STUFFING

301
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,461
BUT THAT'S NOT FUNNY ANYMORE.

302
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,065
HEY, MONICA, I GOT A QUESTION.

303
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,067
I DON'T SEE ANY TATER TOTS.

304
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,469
THAT'S NOT A QUESTION.

305
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,071
BUT MY MOM ALWAYS MAKES THEM.

306
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,672
IT'S LIKE A TRADITION.

307
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,075
YOU GET A LITTLE PIECE OF TURKEY ON YOUR FORK

308
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,676
A LITTLE CRANBERRY SAUCE

309
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,178
AND A TOT.

310
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,379
I MEAN, IT'S BAD ENOUGH

311
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,782
I CAN'T BE WITH MY FAMILY

312
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,383
BECAUSE OF MY DISEASE.

313
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,586
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

314
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:11,090
TONIGHT'S POTATOES WILL BE BOTH MASHED WITH LUMPS

315
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,893
AND IN THE FORM OF TOTS.

316
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,998
ALL RIGHT, I'M OFF TO TALK TO MY UNBORN CHILD.

317
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,300
AH!

318
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,702
OKAY, MOM NEVER HIT.

319
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,708
OKAY, ALL DONE.

320
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,111
WHAT, PHOEBE, DID YOU WHIP THE POT...?

321
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,114
ROSS NEEDS LUMPS.

322
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,116
OH, I'M SORRY.

323
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:40,219
OH, I JUST... I THOUGHT WE COULD HAVE THEM WHIPPED

324
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,621
AND THEN ADD SOME PEAS AND ONIONS.

325
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,023
WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?

326
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,624
WELL, BECAUSE THEN THEY'D BE

327
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,427
JUST LIKE THE WAY MY MOM USED TO MAKE IT YOU KNOW

328
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,329
BEFORE SHE DIED.

329
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:54,233
OKAY, THREE KINDS OF POTATOES COMING UP.

330
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,537
OKAY, GOOD BYE, YOU GUYS.

331
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,339
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

332
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,941
OH, LOOK.

333
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,542
OH, SORRY.

334
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,346
THE MOST UNBELIEVABLE THING HAS HAPPENED.

335
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,348
UNDERDOG HAS GOTTEN AWAY.

336
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,549
THE BALLOON?

337
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,352
NO, NO, THE ACTUAL CARTOON CHARACTER.

338
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,956
OF COURSE THE BALLOON.

339
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,757
IT'S ALL OVER THE NEWS.

340
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,459
RIGHT BEFORE HE REACHED MACY'S, HE BROKE FREE

341
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,461
AND WAS SPOTTED FLYING OVER WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK.

342
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,263
I'M GOING TO THE ROOF. WHO'S WITH ME?

343
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,265
WELL, I CAN'T. I GOT TO GO.

344
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,868
COME ON, AN 80 FOOT INFLATABLE DOG LOOSE OVER THE CITY?

345
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,469
HOW OFTEN DOES THAT HAPPEN?

346
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,071
ALMOST NEVER.

347
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,472
GOT THE KEYS?

348
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,474
OH, OKAY.

349
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,580
ANYTIME YOU'RE READY.

350
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,582
OKAY.

351
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,186
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

352
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,592
OKAY, WH WHERE AM I TALKING TO HERE?

353
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,594
I MEAN, UH, WELL, THERE IS ONE WAY

354
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:59,198
THAT SEEMS TO OFFER A CERTAIN ACOUSTICAL ADVANTAGE, BUT...

355
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,601
JUST AIM FOR THE BUMP.

356
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,603
OKAY.

357
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,907
OKAY, OKAY.

358
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,309
OKAY, HERE GOES.

359
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,317
YOU KNOW, I... YOU KNOW, I CAN'T DO THIS.

360
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,319
UH, THIS IS...

361
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,520
IT'S TOO WEIRD.

362
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,721
I I FEEL STUPID.

363
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,124
ALL RIGHT, SO DON'T DO IT. IT'S FINE.

364
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,927
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT JUST BECAUSE SUSAN DOES IT.

365
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,729
HELLO, BABY.

366
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,532
HELLO. HELLO.

367
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:34,934
THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU FIRST SAW

368
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,936
THE GIANT DOG SHADOW FALL OVER THE PARK...

369
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,938
YEAH, BUT DID THEY HAVE TO SHOOT HIM DOWN?

370
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,040
I MEAN, THAT WAS JUST JUST MEAN.

371
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,442
OKAY. RIGHT ABOUT NOW

372
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,844
THE TURKEY SHOULD BE CRISPY ON THE OUTSIDE

373
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,846
JUICY ON THE INSIDE.

374
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,849
WHY ARE WE STANDING HERE?

375
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,352
WE'RE WAITING FOR YOU TO OPEN THE DOOR.

376
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,354
YOU'VE GOT THE KEYS.

377
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,356
NO, I DON'T.

378
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,358
YES, YOU DO.

379
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,760
WHEN WE LEFT, YOU SAID, "GOT THE KEYS."

380
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,565
NO, I DIDN'T. I ASKED, "GOT THE KE EYS?"

381
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,569
NO, NO, NO, YOU SAID, "GOT THE KE EYS."

382
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:14,173
EITHER OF YOU HAVE THE KE EYS?

383
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,075
THE OVEN IS ON.

384
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,077
OH, I'VE GOT TO GET MY TICKET.

385
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,878
OH, WAIT, WAIT-- WE HAVE A COPY OF YOUR KEY.

386
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,380
WELL, THEN, GET IT, GET IT!

387
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,882
HEY, HEY, THAT TONE WON'T MAKE ME GO ANY FASTER.

388
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:24,883
JOEY...

389
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:25,684
THAT ONE WILL.

390
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:32,091
AND EVERYONE'S TELLING ME, "YOU'VE GOT TO PICK A MAJOR."

391
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,493
"YOU'VE GOT TO PICK A MAJOR."

392
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:39,298
SO, ON A DARE, I PICKED PALEONTOLOGY.

393
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:42,301
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M SAYING

394
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,703
BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT, YOU'RE A FETUS.

395
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:48,307
YOU'RE JUST HAPPY YOU DON'T HAVE GILLS ANYMORE.

396
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,610
LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO IT.

397
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,612
YOU CAN SING TO IT IF YOU WANT TO.

398
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:56,015
OH, PLEASE, I AM NOT SINGING TO YOUR STOMACH, OKAY?

399
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,017
HOW'S IT GOING?

400
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,618
SHH SHH SHH.

401
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:00,819
? HERE WE COME ?

402
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,622
? WALKIN' DOWN THE STREET ?

403
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,825
? GET THE FUNNIEST LOOKS FROM EVERYONE WE MEET ?

404
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,427
? HEY, HEY... ?

405
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,133
HEY, UH, DID YOU JUST FEEL THAT?

406
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,334
I DID.

407
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:16,935
WELL, DOES IT ALWAYS...?

408
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,137
NO, NO, THAT WAS THE FIRST.

409
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,439
HEY, KEEP SINGING, KEEP SINGING.

410
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,441
? HEY, HEY, YOU'RE MY BABY ?

411
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,244
? UH, AND I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET YOU ?

412
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:28,047
? UH, WHEN YOU COME OUT I'LL BUY YOU A BAGEL ?

413
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,648
? AND THEN WE'LL GO TO THE ZOO... ?

414
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:30,849

415
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,851
I FELT IT.

416
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,953
? HEY, HEY, I'M YOUR DADDY ?

417
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,555
? I'M THE ONE WITHOUT ANY BREASTS. ?

418
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,961
OH, THIS IS REALLY GREAT!

419
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:46,165
IT'S 5:00, MY PLANE IS NOW PULLING AWAY FROM THE GATE.

420
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,167
MAYBE YOU CAN TAKE A LATER FLIGHT.

421
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,768
THERE IS NO LATER FLIGHT.

422
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,370
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN GO TOMORROW.

423
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,372
TOMORROW IS NOT THANKSGIVING.

424
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,175
OKAY, LOOK, IF I'M GOING TO TRY TO CHEER YOU UP

425
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,177
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MEET ME HALFWAY.

426
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,579
CAN YOU GO ANY FASTER WITH THAT?

427
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,482
HEY, I GOT ONE KEYHOLE AND ABOUT A ZILLION KEYS.

428
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,084
YOU DO THE MATH.

429
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,687
WHY DO YOU GUYS HAVE SO MANY KEYS IN THERE ANYWAY?

430
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,490
FOR AN EMERGENCY JUST LIKE THIS.

431
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,693
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, SMIRKY, IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU

432
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:18,697
AND YOUR STUPID BALLOON, I WOULD BE ON A PLANE

433
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,999
WATCHING A WOMAN DO THIS RIGHT NOW

434
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,001
BUT I'M NOT.

435
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,804
I SWEAR YOU SAID YOU HAD THE KEYS.

436
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,005
NO, I DIDN'T. I WOULDN'T SAY

437
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,607
I HAD THE KEYS UNLESS I HAD THE KEYS

438
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,609
AND I OBVIOUSLY DID NOT HAVE THE KEYS!

439
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,412
OH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT-- ENOUGH WITH THE KEYS.

440
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,013
NO ONE SAY "KEYS."

441
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,217
WHY WOULD I HAVE THE KEYS?

442
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,818
OH!

443
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,020
ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT YOU SAID YOU HAD THEM?

444
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,021
BUT I DIDN'T.

445
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,223
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE.

446
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,924
WHY? BECAUSE. WHY? BECAUSE.

447
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,926
BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS MY RESPONSIBILITY?

448
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,128
ISN'T IT ENOUGH THAT I'M MAKING

449
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:50,729
THANKSGIVING DINNER FOR EVERYONE?

450
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,831
YOU KNOW, EVERYONE WANTS A DIFFERENT KIND OF POTATO.

451
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,234
SO I'M MAKING DIFFERENT KINDS OF POTATOES.

452
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,737
AND DOES ANYBODY CARE WHAT KIND OF POTATOES I WANT?

453
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,940
NOOOO! NO! NO!

454
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,942
YOU KNOW, JUST AS LONG AS PHOEBE

455
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,544
GETS HER PEAS AND ONIONS

456
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,646
AND MARIO GETS HIS TOTS.

457
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,548
IT'S MY FIRST THANKSGIVING

458
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:14,353
AND IT'S... IT'S ALL BURNED AND...

459
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,755
AND I... I...

460
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,158
OKAY, MONICA, ONLY DOGS CAN HEAR YOU NOW, SO...

461
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,560
THE DOOR IS OPEN. HERE WE GO.

462
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,761
OH, GOD.

463
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,966
ALL RIGHT, CHANDLER, DON'T LOSE THIS.

464
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,168
OH, NO, NO!

465
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,373
GREAT. OH, WELL!

466
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,074
WELL, THE TURKEY'S BURNT.

467
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,076
POTATOES ARE RUINED.

468
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,078
POTATOES ARE RUINED.

469
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,080
POTATOES ARE RUINED.

470
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:43,782
? HERE WE COME ?

471
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:47,686
? WALKIN' DOWN THE... DO DO DO... ?

472
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,189
THIS DOESN'T SMELL LIKE MOM'S.

473
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,193
NO, IT DOESN'T, DOES IT?

474
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,794
BUT YOU WANTED LUMPS, ROSS?

475
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,796
WELL, HERE YOU GO, BUDDY. YOU GOT ONE.

476
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:01,300
DON'T YELL AT ME. YOU BURNT DINNER.

477
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,903
HEY! HEY, DON'T MAKE HER SQUEAK AGAIN.

478
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,205
OH! GOD, THIS IS GREAT.

479
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,806
THE PLANE IS GONE

480
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,209
SO I GUESS I'M STUCK HERE WITH YOU GUYS.

481
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,810
HEY, WE ALL HAD BETTER PLANS, OKAY.

482
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,213
THIS WAS NOBODY'S FIRST CHOICE.

483
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,814
OH, REALLY?

484
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,316
SO WHY WAS I BUSTING MY ASS

485
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:20,118
TO MAKE THIS DELICIOUS THANKSGIVING DINNER?

486
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,320
YOU CALL THAT DELICIOUS?

487
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,523

488
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,925
STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP IT!

489
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,828
NOW, THIS FEELS LIKE THANKSGIVING.

490
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,337
OH, SKIING...

491
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:42,841
SHOOP, SHOOP, SHOOP.

492
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:43,642
SHOOP.

493
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,246
EW!

494
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,247
WHAT?

495
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,248
UGLY NAKED GUY'S

496
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,250
TAKING HIS TURKEY OUT OF THE OVEN.

497
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,253

498
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,255
OH, HE JUST SAT IN GRAVY.

499
00:20:58,156 --> 00:20:59,558
OH, MY GOD.

500
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,159
HE'S NOT ALONE.

501
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,962
UGLY NAKED GUY IS HAVING

502
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,764
THANKSGIVING DINNER WITH UGLY NAKED GAL.

503
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,568
I'VE GOT TO SEE THIS.

504
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,371

505
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,773
ALL RIGHT, UGLY NAKED GUY!

506
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,277
OOH, UGLY NAKED DANCING.

507
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,879
IT'S NICE THAT HE HAS SOMEONE.

508
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,791
SHALL I CARVE?

509
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:35,294
BY ALL MEANS.

510
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,094
ALL RIGHT.

511
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,101
OKAY. WHO WANTS LIGHT CHEESE?

512
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:45,103
AND WHO WANTS DARK CHEESE?

513
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,805
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW

514
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,807
ABOUT THE DARK CHEESE.

515
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,610
DOES ANYBODY WANT TO SPLIT THIS WITH ME?  OH. I WILL.

516
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,412
MM, YOU GUYS HAVE TO MAKE A WISH.

517
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,013
MAKE A WISH?

518
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:58,216
COME ON. YOU KNOW  THANKSGIVING.

519
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,822
OOH! YOU GOT THE BIGGER HALF.

520
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,123
WHAT'D YOU WISH FOR?

521
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:08,126
THE BIGGER HALF.

522
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,029
ALL RIGHT.

523
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,631
I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST.

524
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:13,832
LITTLE TOAST HERE. DING, DING, DING.

525
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,434
I KNOW THIS ISN'T EXACTLY

526
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,236
THE KIND OF THANKSGIVING THAT ALL OF YOU PLANNED

527
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:22,040
BUT FOR ME, THIS HAS BEEN REALLY GREAT. YOU KNOW?

528
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,243
I THINK BECAUSE IT DIDN'T INVOLVE DIVORCE

529
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,245
OR PROJECTILE VOMITING.

530
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,450
ANYWAY, I WAS JUST THINKING

531
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,051
I MEAN, IF YOU HAD GONE TO VAIL

532
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,454
OR IF YOU GUYS HAD BEEN WITH YOUR FAMILY

533
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,856
OR IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE SYPHILIS AND STUFF...

534
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,661
...WE WOULDN'T BE ALL TOGETHER, YOU KNOW?

535
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,464
SO I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS

536
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,866
THAT, UH, I'M VERY THANKFUL

537
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,669
THAT ALL OF YOUR THANKSGIVINGS SUCKED.

538
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,171
 THAT'S SO SWEET. THANK YOU.

539
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:55,974
MM...

540
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:56,975
AND HEY...

541
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,977
HERE'S TO A LOUSY CHRISTMAS.

542
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,178
AND A CRAPPY NEW YEAR.

543
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:01,880
HEAR, HEAR.
