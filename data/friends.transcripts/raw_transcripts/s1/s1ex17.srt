562
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,153
OH, GOSH.

563
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:16,755
I LOVE YOU.

564
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:17,956
INSURANCE?

565
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,558
OH, YEAH. CHECK IT.

566
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,159
DEFINITELY GOING TO WANT SOME OF THAT.

567
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,962
YOU DON'T HAVE INSURANCE?

568
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,964
WHY? HOW MUCH IS THIS GOING TO COST?

569
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,867
X RAYS ALONE COULD BE A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS.

570
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,268
WHAT WILL WE DO?

571
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:32,471
THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO.

572
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:36,074
UM... UNLESS, UNLESS I USE YOURS.

573
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,076
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

574
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:39,678
NOW, WAIT A SECOND.

575
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,279
WHO DID I JUST PUT

576
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,082
AS MY "IN CASE OF EMERGENCY" PERSON?

577
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,084
THAT'S INSURANCE FRAUD.

578
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,285
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

579
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,887
THEN FORGET IT.

580
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,889
MIGHT AS WELL JUST GO HOME.

581
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,591
OW! OW! OW!

582
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:53,692
OKAY. COME HERE.

583
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:54,993
I HATE THIS.

584
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,194
THANK YOU.

585
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:57,395
I LOVE YOU.

586
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,397
HI.

587
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:03,001
UM, I'M GOING TO NEED A NEW SET OF THESE FORMS.

588
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,603
WHY?

589
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:08,206
I AM REALLY AN IDIOT.

590
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,407
YOU SEE

591
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:11,409
I WAS FILLING OUT MY FRIEND'S FORM

592
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:14,212
AND INSTEAD OF PUTTING HER INFORMATION

593
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:15,413
I PUT MINE.

594
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,816
YOU ARE AN IDIOT.

595
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,818
YEP. THAT'S ME.

596
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,220
I'M THAT STUPID.

597
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,822
I HAD A DREAM LAST NIGHT

598
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:26,625
WHERE I WAS PLAYING FOOTBALL WITH MY KID.

599
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:29,027
 THAT'S NICE.

600
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,028
NO. WITH HIM.

601
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:37,035
I'M ON THIS FIELD, AND THEY HIKE ME THE BABY.

602
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,737
AND I KNOW

603
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,639
I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING

604
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,641
BECAUSE THE TAMPA BAY DEFENSE

605
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,142
IS COMING RIGHT AT ME.

606
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,144
TAMPA BAY HAS A TERRIBLE TEAM.

607
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,046
RIGHT, BUT...

608
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,048
IT IS JUST ME AND THE BABY

609
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,450
SO I'M THINKING THEY CAN TAKE US.

610
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:59,257
AND SO, I, UH... I JUST HEAVE IT DOWNFIELD!

611
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,859
WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?! THAT'S A BABY!

612
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,861
HE SHOULD TAKE THE SACK?

613
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:11,570
ANYWAY, SUDDENLY I'M DOWNFIELD, AND I REALIZE THATI'MTHE ONE

614
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,372
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO CATCH HIM, RIGHT?

615
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:17,976
ONLY I KNOW THERE IS NO WAY I'LL GET THERE IN TIME.

616
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,878
SO I AM RUNNING AND I'M RUNNING

617
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,280
AND THAT IS WHEN I WOKE UP.

618
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,483
SEE, I AM SO NOT READY TO BE A FATHER.

619
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,485
HEY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.

620
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,487
YOU'RE ONE OF THE MOST CARING

621
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,089
MOST RESPONSIBLE MEN

622
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,592
IN NORTH AMERICA.

623
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,493
YOU'LL MAKE A GREAT DAD.

624
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:38,296
YEAH. YOU AND THE BABY JUST NEED BETTER BLOCKING.

625
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:41,499
HAVE EITHER ONE OF YOU GUYS

626
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:44,302
EVER BEEN TO THE RAINBOW ROOM?

627
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,503
IS IT REAL EXPENSIVE?

628
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,505
ONLY IF YOU ORDER STUFF.

629
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:49,507
I'M TAKING URSULA TONIGHT.

630
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,109
IT'S HER BIRTHDAY.

631
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,511
WHOA. WHAT ABOUT PHOEBE'S BIRTHDAY?

632
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:54,613
WHEN'S THAT?

633
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,015
UH...

634
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,116
TONIGHT.

635
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,618
AH, MAN.

636
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:03,622
WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF THAT HAPPENING?

637
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,423
YOU TAKE YOUR TIME.

638
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,430
THERE IT IS.

639
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,435
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

640
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:18,637
WHAT CAN I DO?

641
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,840
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO SCREW IT UP WITH URSULA.

642
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,441
AND YOUR FRIEND PHOEBE?

643
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,244
IF SHE'S MY FRIEND, HOPEFULLY SHE'LL UNDERSTAND.

644
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:27,445
WOULDN'T YOU GUYS?

645
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:29,748
MAN, IF YOU TRIED SOMETHING LIKE THAT

646
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:31,349
ON MY BIRTHDAY

647
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,351
YOU'D BE STARING AT THE BUSINESS END

648
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,453
OF A HISSY FIT.

649
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:38,056
YOU ADD A PINCH OF SAFFRON.

650
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,058
IT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE.

651
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,261
OKAY.

652
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,263
UHH... MONICA.

653
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:46,464
YES.

654
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,466
YES, SHE IS.

655
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:49,267
HI.

656
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,269
THIS IS MY FRIEND RACHEL.

657
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,470
HI, RACHEL.

658
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,072
I'M DR. MITCHELL.

659
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,674
AND I'M HIS FRIEND, DR. ROSEN.

660
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,275
UH... I'M OKAY HERE.

661
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:58,476
ACTUALLY, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

662
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,078
I DON'T MIND AT ALL.

663
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,080
WHY DON'T YOU GO TAKE YOUR BREAK?

664
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,482
NO, NO, THIS IS WHY I BECAME A DOCTOR.

665
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,084
ANKLES, AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

666
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:09,688
AREN'T YOU A LITTLE CUTE TO BE A DOCTOR?

667
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,889
EXCUSE ME?

668
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,490
I MEANT "YOUNG."

669
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,492
YOUNG TO BE A DOCTOR.

670
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:15,694
GOOD, RACH.

671
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,494
THANK YOU.

672
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:17,696
RIGHT.

673
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,504
SO HE SAID IT WAS JUST A SPRAIN

674
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:27,706
AND THAT WAS IT.

675
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,307
YOU LEFT OUT THE STUPID PART.

676
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:30,909
IT'S NOT STUPID.

677
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,311
THE VERY CUTE, CUTE, CUTE DOCTORS ASKED US OUT

678
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:36,114
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT, AND I SAID YES.

679
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,116
I THINK IT'S TOTALLY INSANE.

680
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,118
I MEAN, THEY WORK FOR THE HOSPITAL.

681
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,120
IT'S LIKE RETURNING TO THE SCENE

682
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,722
OF THE CRIME.

683
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,323
I SAY WE BLOW OFF THE DATES.

684
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:46,524
WHAT?!

685
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:47,726
MONICA, THEY ARE CUTE.

686
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,327
THEY ARE DOCTORS.

687
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,128
CUTE DOCTORS.

688
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,730
DOCTORS WHO ARE CUTE.

689
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,931
ALL RIGHT.

690
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:56,134
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED SO FAR?

691
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,335

692
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,536
OH, GOD. OKAY.

693
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:05,944
 SURPRISE!

694
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:12,250
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

695
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,053
YOU SCARED THE CRAP OUT OF ME.

696
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,156
WAS THAT THE CAKE?

697
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,357
YEAH. YEP.

698
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,359
I GOT A LEMON SHMUSH.

699
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,361
COME ON. SHE'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

700
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:26,965
 OH, I HOPE IT'S OKAY.

701
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,171
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY, PEEHEE."

702
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:37,375
MAYBE WE CAN MAKE A "B" OUT OF ONE OF THOSE ROSES.

703
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,979
WE'LL JUST USE OUR SPECIAL CAKE TOOLS.

704
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,981
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

705
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,983
 SURPRISE!

706
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,584
OH! OH! OH!

707
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,387
THIS IS SO GREAT!

708
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:50,989
OH, MY GOD!

709
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,792
THIS WAS NOT AT ALL SCARY.

710
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,995
OH, LOOK-- "HAPPY BIRTHDAY, PEEHEE."

711
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,997
WHAT A STRANGE NEW NICKNAME.

712
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,198
I LIKE IT!

713
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:00,999
OH, MY GOD!

714
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,001
HI, EVERYBODY. HI, BETTY.

715
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,602
BETTY! HI!

716
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,304
YOU FOUND BETTY!

717
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,306
THIS IS SO GREAT.

718
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,509
OH, EVERYBODY I LOVE IS IN THE SAME ROOM, OH.

719
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,511
WHERE'S JOEY?

720
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,615
DID YOU SEE BETTY?

721
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,928
I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING-- I WOULDN'T MIND HAVING

722
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,830
A PIECE OF THIS SUN DRIED

723
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,531
TOMATO BUSINESS.

724
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:36,734
FIVE YEARS AGO, IF SOMEBODY HAD SAID TO ME

725
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:39,938
"HERE'S A TOMATO THAT LOOKS LIKE A PRUNE"

726
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,740
I'D HAVE SAID, "GET OUT OF MY OFFICE."

727
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,944
DAD, BEFORE I WAS BORN, DID YOU FREAK OUT AT ALL?

728
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,545
I'M NOT FREAKING OUT!

729
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:50,348
I'M JUST SAYING IF SOMEONE HAD COME TO ME...

730
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,549
DAD, DAD, DAD...

731
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:54,352
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE BABY THING.

732
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,754
DID YOU EVER GET THIS SORT OF...

733
00:30:56,754 --> 00:31:00,358
PANICKY, "OH, MY GOD, I'M GOING TO BE A FATHER"

734
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,960
KIND OF A THING?

735
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,561
NO.

736
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,764
WE JUST HAD KIDS BACK THEN.

737
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:08,366
WE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT.

738
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,768
WHAT ELSE COULD THE SUN DRY, I WONDER?

739
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,972
DAD, COME ON. KIDS.

740
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,573
RIGHT. LOOK

741
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,575
YOUR MOTHER DID THE WORK.

742
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:19,577
I WAS BUSY WITH THE BUSINESS.

743
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:21,579
I WASN'T AROUND THAT MUCH.

744
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:22,780
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

745
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,583
NO, DAD. I WAS JUST WONDERING...

746
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,986
BECAUSE THERE'S TIME TO MAKE UP FOR THAT.

747
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:31,589
YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO GO TO THAT COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG.

748
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,591
HOW ABOUT WE DO THAT?

749
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:35,193
THANKS, DAD, REALLY.

750
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,595
I JU... YOU KNOW, I JUST...

751
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:42,000
I JUST... I JUST NEEDED TO KNOW, UM...

752
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,203
WHEN DID YOU START TO FEEL LIKE A FATHER?

753
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,404
OH.

754
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:49,607
WELL, I GUESS IT MUST HAVE BEEN...

755
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,609
THE DAY AFTER YOU WERE BORN.

756
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,611
WE WERE IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM.

757
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,013
YOUR MOTHER WAS ASLEEP

758
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,614
AND THEY BROUGHT YOU IN

759
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,517
AND GAVE YOU TO ME.

760
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,619
YOU WERE THIS UGLY LITTLE RED THING.

761
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:02,820

762
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,822
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN

763
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:08,426
YOU GRABBED MY FINGER WITH YOUR WHOLE FIST

764
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:11,629
AND YOU SQUEEZED IT SO TIGHT.

765
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:14,032
AND THAT'S WHEN I KNEW.

766
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:20,038
SO YOU DON'T WANT TO GO

767
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,040
TO WILLIAMSBURG?

768
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,044
WE CAN GO TO WILLIAMSBURG.

769
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,146
EAT YOUR FISH.

770
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,750

771
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,553
RACHEL, THE CUTE DOCTORS ARE HERE.

772
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,155
OKAY, COMING.

773
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:38,856
HI. COME ON IN.

774
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,058
 HI.

775
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,259
HI.

776
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,460
WE BROUGHT WINE.

777
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,462
IT'S FROM THE CELLARS

778
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,464
OF ERNEST AND TOVA BORGNINE.

779
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,466
SO, HOW COULD WE RESIST?

780
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,068
OH, THAT'S GREAT! LOOK AT THAT.

781
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,669
MONICA, HOW'S THE ANKLE?

782
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:52,470
IT'S...

783
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,872

784
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,874
WHY DON'T YOU TELL THEM?

785
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:59,277
AFTER ALL, IT IS YOUR ANKLE.

786
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:00,878
IT'S FEELING A LOT BETTER.

787
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,080
THANK YOU.

788
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,681
LISTEN, GUYS, SIT DOWN

789
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,683
AND WE'LL GET YOU SOME GLASSES.

790
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:06,684
OKAY.

791
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:07,885
OKAY.

792
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:09,487
STAT.

793
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,691
LISTEN. I'M THINKING

794
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,693
WHY DON'T WE JUST TELL THEM WHO WE REALLY ARE.

795
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,695
I REALLY THINK IT'LL BE FINE.

796
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:19,297
IT WILL NOT BE FINE.

797
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,498
WE'LL GET IN TROUBLE.

798
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,900
WOULD YOU STOP BEING SUCH A WUSS.

799
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,102
A WUSS?

800
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,904
EXCUSE ME FOR LIVING IN THE REAL WORLD.

801
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:27,705
SO?

802
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:29,707
SO THEY STILL SEEM NORMAL.

803
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:30,908
THEY ARE NORMAL.

804
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,410
BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT

805
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,412
EVERY TIME WE GO OUT WITH WOMEN

806
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,014
WE MEET AT THE HOSPITAL...

807
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,715
RELAX. LOOK AROUND.

808
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,118
THERE ARE NO PAGAN ALTARS.

809
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,920
NO PILES OF BONES IN THE CORNERS.

810
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,522
THEY'RE FINE.

811
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,723
GO LIKE THIS.

812
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,229
I SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT.

813
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:54,032
SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE SUCH A BIG BABY.

814
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,233
I AM NOT A BABY.

815
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,235
SERIOUS. I MEAN, EVERY TIME...

816
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,436
YOU KNOW WHAT? WHAT?

817
00:33:58,436 --> 00:33:59,637
YOU KNOW WHAT? WHAT?

818
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:01,239
YOU KNOW WHAT? WHAT?!

819
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,241
EVERY DAY, YOU ARE BECOMING

820
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,643
MORE AND MORE LIKE YOUR MOTHER.

821
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:06,444
EXCUSE ME.

822
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,046
HELLO! HERE WE GO!

823
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,048
THIS IS A GREAT PLACE.

824
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,050
HOW LONG HAVE YOU LIVED HERE?

825
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,253
THANKS. I'VE BEEN HERE ABOUT SIX YEARS.

826
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:18,056
AND RACHEL MOVED IN A FEW MONTHS AGO.

827
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,257
YEAH.

828
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:22,760
SEE, I WAS SUPPOSED TO GET MARRIED, BUT, UM...

829
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,163
I LEFT THE GUY AT THE ALTAR.

830
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:27,565
HMM.

831
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,666
REALLY?

832
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:29,867
YEAH.

833
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:33,071
YEAH, I KNOW IT'S PRETTY SELFISH

834
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,873
BUT, HEY, THAT'S ME.

835
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,678
WHY DON'T YOU TRY THE HUMMUS?

836
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:43,081
SO, MONICA, WHAT DO YOU DO?

837
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,484
UHH... I AM A CHEF AT A RESTAURANT UPTOWN.

838
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,685
GOOD FOR YOU.

839
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:48,886
YEAH, IT IS.

840
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:52,090
MOSTLY BECAUSE I GET TO BOSS PEOPLE AROUND

841
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,492
WHICH I JUST LOVE TO DO.

842
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:59,597
WELL, THIS HUMMUS IS GREAT.

843
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,599
GOD BLESS THE CHICK PEA.

844
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,903

845
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,505
OH, GOD.

846
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,907
I AM SO SPOILED.

847
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,913
THAT'S IT.

848
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,117
I SHOPLIFT.

849
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,322
THAT WAS YEARS AGO, AND YOU HAD NO IDEA

850
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,324
THAT LIPSTICK WAS IN YOUR POCKET.

851
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:30,728
DID I TELL YOU THAT I THINK I AM SO MUCH CUTER THAN I AM?

852
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,130
AND BY THE WAY

853
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,932
HAVE I MENTIONED THAT BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL

854
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,134
I WAS A COW?

855
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,537
I USED TO WET MY BED.

856
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:44,142
I USED MY BREASTS TO GET PEOPLE'S ATTENTION.

857
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,444
WE BOTH DO THAT.

858
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,552

859
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:59,757

860
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:02,760
MONICA AND RACHEL'S APARTMENT.

861
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,362
UH, JUST ONE SECOND.

862
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,364
UH, RACHEL--

863
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,665
IT'S YOUR DAD.

864
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,869
HI, DAD.

865
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,070
NO. IT'S ME.

866
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,375
LISTEN, DAD, I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.

867
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,377
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING, UM...

868
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,978
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT

869
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:22,980
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO TELL YOU.

870
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,682
EXCUSE ME A SECOND.

871
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,385
REMEMBER BACK IN FRESHMAN YEAR?

872
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:29,587
BILLY DRESKIN AND I HAD SEX

873
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:30,588
ON YOUR BED.

874
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,190

875
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,901
DADDY... DADDY, WHY?

876
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:46,204
WHY WOULD I SLEEP WITH BILLY DRESKIN?

877
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,006
HIS FATHER TRIED TO PUT YOU OUT OF BUSINESS.

878
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:51,008
YOU ARE DEAD!

879
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,514
HEY, RACHEL, ARE THESE YOUR CONDOMS?

880
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:02,620
OH, NO. NO, THAT WAS JUST MONICA.

881
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,622
SHE'S DRUNK AGAIN.

882
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:09,327
UH, PHEEBS, I DON'T THINK "SCRUNCHY" IS A WORD.

883
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,729
WHY NOT? IF "CRUNCHY" IS A WORD

884
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,331
WHY ISN'T SCRUNCHY?

885
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:16,934
WELL, OKAY, THEN I'M USING THAT SAME ARGUMENT

886
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,135
FOR "FLIGAMENT."

887
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,240
ROSS, HE'S GOT THE REMOTE AGAIN.

888
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,441
GOOD.

889
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:26,644
MAYBE HE CAN SWITCH IT BACK.

890
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,747

891
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,049
MAYBE NOT.

892
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,651
OKAY, DADDY

893
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,753
DADDY, THAT'S THE OTHER LINE.

894
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,956
OKAY, NO, NOT EVEN IN MY BEDROOM.

895
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:42,560
OKAY. OKAY. BYE BYE.

896
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,562
HELLO?

897
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:48,165
UM... YEAH. UH...

898
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:50,167
OKAY, HOLD ON A SECOND.

899
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,769
LET ME JUST SEE IF SHE'S HERE.

900
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,571
IT'S THE WOMAN FROM THE HOSPITAL

901
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:54,772
ADMISSIONS OFFICE.

902
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,774
THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE FORM.

903
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,376
OH, GOD. WHAT DO WE DO?

904
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:59,176
I DON'T KNOW.

905
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,978
FIND OUT WHAT THEY WANT.

906
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:03,381
OKAY. NO, YOU DO IT.

907
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,383
HELLO. THIS IS MONICA.

908
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,385
YEAH?

909
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:08,586
OH.

910
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:09,787
OKAY.

911
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,389
YES, WE'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

912
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,189
THANK YOU.

913
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:13,391
WHAT?

914
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,592
WE FORGOT TO SIGN

915
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,193
ONE OF THE ADMISSIONS FORMS.

916
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:17,395
OKAY, YOU WERE RIGHT.

917
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:18,596
THIS WAS NOT WORTH IT.

918
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:19,797
THANK YOU.

919
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,600
OKAY, LET ME JUST CHANGE.

920
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,702
"GARGE?"

921
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:25,903
NAUTICAL TERM.

922
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,905
CHEATING MAN. OKAY.

923
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:31,208
HEY.

924
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,810
HEY. HI. HEY.

925
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,011
SHE STILL DIDN'T CALL?

926
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,513
NO.

927
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,114
TROUBLE?

928
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:40,217
YOUR SISTER STOOD ME UP THE OTHER NIGHT.

929
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:41,819
OH, NO. DON'T YOU HATE IT

930
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,821
WHEN PEOPLE AREN'T THERE FOR YOU?

931
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,024
WHAT IS THAT?

932
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,026
"TUSHY."

933
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:52,530
DID YOU TRY CALLING HER?

934
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,131
I'VE BEEN TRYING FOR TWO DAYS.

935
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,733
WHEN I CALLED THE RESTAURANT

936
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,135
THEY SAID SHE WAS TOO BUSY TO TALK.

937
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:00,137
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S BLOWING ME OFF.

938
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:19,256
EXCUSE ME, WE HAD THE TWO CHEF'S SALADS.

939
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,258
OH, AND HOW WERE THEY?

940
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,661
NO, WE HAVEN'T HAD THEM YET.

941
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:26,864
WE'RE STILL HOPING TO HAVE THEM.

942
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,266
OKAY.

943
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:36,874
HEY.

944
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,476
OH.

945
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,480
HAVE YOU GOT A MINUTE?

946
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,882
YEAH. I'M JUST WORKING.

947
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,492
SO...

948
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,693
UH HUH.

949
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:59,697
UM... OH, I GOT YOU A BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

950
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,899
OH, WOW, YOU REMEMBERED.

951
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:09,807
OH, IT'S A JUDY JETSON THERMOS.

952
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,409
THE KIND YOU...

953
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,610
RIGHT.

954
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,211
I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU TOO.

955
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:15,413
HOW'D YOU KNOW

956
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,614
I WAS COMING?

957
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,916
UM... YEAH, UM, TWIN THING.

958
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:24,622
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THIS.

959
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:27,725
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU... DID THIS.

960
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,530
SO...

961
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,932
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH YOU AND JOEY?

962
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,133
OH, RIGHT.

963
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,536
HE IS SO GREAT.

964
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,137
BUT THAT'S OVER.

965
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:41,939
DOES HE KNOW?

966
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:42,740
WHO?

967
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,341
JOEY.

968
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:45,543
YOU KNOW, UM...

969
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:48,345
HE'S REALLY NUTSY ABOUT YOU.

970
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,247
HE IS? WHY?

971
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:51,449
YOU GOT ME.

972
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,451
EXCUSE ME.

973
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:57,455
DOESN'T THIS COME WITH A SIDE SALAD?

974
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,157
SO, ARE YOU GOING TO CALL HIM?

975
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:01,358
YOU THINK HE LIKES ME?

976
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:02,960
NO, JOEY.

977
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,962
OH. NO.

978
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,564
NO. HE IS SO SMART.

979
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:07,765
HE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

980
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,366
DO YOU WANT SOME CHICKEN?

981
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:13,370
NO. NO FOOD WITH A FACE.

982
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,173
YOU HAVE NOT CHANGED.

983
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:17,775
YEAH, YOU TOO.

984
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,677
THANKS.

985
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,278
EXCUSE ME.

986
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:22,880
MY SIDE SALAD?

987
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,484
SERVICE IN HERE IS HORRIBLE.

988
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,085
NOW I KNOW WHAT PEOPLE MEAN.

989
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,991
HI. REMEMBER US?

990
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:34,892
MM HMM.

991
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,294
YOU JUST CALLED A LITTLE WHILE AGO

992
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:39,697
ABOUT NEEDING A SIGNATURE ON THE ADMISSIONS FORM.

993
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:42,099
WELL, IT TURNS OUT WE NEED A WHOLE NEW ONE

994
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:46,904
BECAUSE, YOU SEE, I PUT THE WRONG NAME AGAIN

995
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,105
BECAUSE, UM...

996
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:51,308
YOU'RE THAT STUPID.

997
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:52,309
I AM.

998
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,311
I'M THAT STUPID.

999
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:55,913
YEAH, AND I'M JUST GOING

1000
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,515
TO PAY FOR THIS WITH A CHECK.

1001
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,017
WELL, YOUR INSURANCE WILL COVER THAT.

1002
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,418
YEAH, I KNOW.

1003
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:03,020
I'M JUST NOT THAT BRIGHT EITHER.

1004
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:10,427
MON, I'M SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT, WHAT I SAID.

1005
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,830
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE ANYTHING LIKE YOUR MOTHER.

1006
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:13,731
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

1007
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,332
AND I DON'T THINK YOU WERE SELFISH

1008
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:16,133
FOR RUNNING OUT ON BARRY.

1009
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,735
OH, OH, AND I'M SORRY

1010
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:20,538
THAT I SAID YOU WERE A COW IN HIGH SCHOOL.

1011
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,739
AW, THAT'S OKAY.

1012
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:22,940
I WAS A COW.

1013
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,942
I KNOW.

1014
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:28,546
I'M JUST SORRY I SAID IT.

1015
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,748
OKAY, WORST CASE SCENARIO.

1016
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,350
SAY YOU NEVER FEEL LIKE A FATHER.

1017
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,052
SAY YOUR SON NEVER FEELS

1018
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,855
CONNECTED TO YOU AS ONE.

1019
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,658
SAY ALL OF HIS RELATIONSHIPS

1020
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:42,259
ARE AFFECTED BY THIS.

1021
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,861
DO YOU HAVE A POINT?

1022
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,865
YOU KNOW, YOU'D THINK I WOULD.

1023
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,670
WHAT'S UP WITH THE SIMIAN?

1024
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,072
IT'S JUST A FURBALL.

1025
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,674
ALL RIGHT.

1026
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:58,175
OKAY, WHOSE TURN IS IT?

1027
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,376
YOURS.

1028
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:01,178
I JUST GOT 43 POINTS FOR "KIDNEY."

1029
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,282
NO, YOU GOT ZERO POINTS FOR "IDNEY."

1030
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:07,484
HEY, WHERE'S MY "K"?

1031
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:10,287

1032
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,391
YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME.

1033
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,393
MY MONKEY SWALLOWED A "K."

1034
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:17,595
YOU'LL HAVE TO GET

1035
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,196
THAT ANIMAL OUT OF HERE.

1036
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,699
THE ANIMAL HOSPITAL IS WAY ACROSS TOWN.

1037
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:22,900
HE'S CHOKING.

1038
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,701
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1039
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:25,703
MARCEL SWALLOWED A SCRABBLE TILE.

1040
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:26,904
OH.

1041
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:28,906
EXCUSE ME.

1042
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:31,609
THIS HOSPITAL IS FOR PEOPLE.

1043
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,210
LADY, HE IS PEOPLE.

1044
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,411
HE HAS A NAME, OKAY?

1045
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:36,013
HE WATCHES JEOPARDY

1046
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:38,816
HE TOUCHES HIMSELF WHEN NOBODY'S WATCHING.

1047
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:41,619
PLEASE, PLEASE, HAVE A HEART.

1048
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,820
I'LL LOOK AT HIM.

1049
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,721
OH, THANK YOU. OH, THANK YOU.

1050
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:44,922
MICHAEL! MICHAEL!

1051
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:45,422
RACHEL.

1052
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:47,725
WHAT? OH. MONICA. HI.

1053
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:02,039
HEY...

1054
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,441
URS... WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1055
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:06,844
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO CALL YOU.

1056
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:09,246
LISTEN, UM...

1057
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,448
NO, NO, NO, DON'T SAY, "LISTEN."

1058
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,050
I KNOW THAT "LISTEN."

1059
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,251
I'VE SAID THAT "LISTEN."

1060
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:15,452
I'M SORRY.

1061
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:16,553
I DON'T GET IT.

1062
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:18,155
WHAT HAPPENED?

1063
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,958
WHAT ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU SAID UNDER THE BRIDGE?

1064
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:22,960
YEAH, UM...

1065
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,362
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD JUST FORGET ABOUT

1066
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,765
WHAT I SAID UNDER THE BRIDGE.

1067
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:30,968
I WAS TALKING CRAZY THAT NIGHT.

1068
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:32,569
I WAS SO DRUNK.

1069
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:34,171
YOU DON'T DRINK.

1070
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,774
THAT'S RIGHT, I DON'T.

1071
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:39,176
BUT I WAS DRUNK ON YOU.

1072
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,178
OH, URS.

1073
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,180
YEAH, SO IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

1074
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,684
WHY? IS IT BECAUSE I'M FRIENDS WITH PHOEBE?

1075
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:50,688
IF IT WAS, WOULD YOU STOP HANGING OUT WITH HER?

1076
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:53,691
NO.

1077
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,693
NO. I COULDN'T DO THAT.

1078
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:56,894
THEN, YEAH.

1079
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,095
IT'S BECAUSE OF PHOEBE.

1080
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,499
SO, IT'S EITHER HER OR ME.

1081
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:08,505
THEN, UH... THEN I'M SORRY.

1082
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:16,714
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GOING TO BE REALLY HARD TO GET OVER.

1083
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,315
I KNOW.

1084
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:28,726
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BREAKING UP OR WHAT

1085
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,528
BUT YOU HAVE NEVER LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL.

1086
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:33,130
REALLY?

1087
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,261
PHEEBS?

1088
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:05,662
YEAH? OH.

1089
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:17,775
HE LOOKS SO TINY.

1090
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:18,976
WE JUST GOT THE MESSAGE.

1091
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:20,577
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

1092
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:22,579
YEAH. THE DOCTOR GOT THE "K" OUT.

1093
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:26,383
HE ALSO FOUND AN "M" AND AN "O."

1094
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:30,087
WE THINK HE WAS TRYING TO SPELL OUT "MONKEY."

1095
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,596
WELL, THE DOCTOR SAYS HE'S GOING TO BE FINE.

1096
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,598
HE'S JUST SLEEPING NOW.

1097
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:44,501
SO, YOU FEEL LIKE A DAD YET?

1098
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,503
NO. WHY?

1099
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:47,704
HEY, COME ON.

1100
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:48,906
YOU CAME THROUGH.

1101
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:50,507
YOU DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.

1102
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:51,909
THAT IS VERY DAD.

1103
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:52,709
OH, LOOK.

1104
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:53,911
HE'S WAKING UP.

1105
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:54,912
HEY, FELLA.

1106
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:56,513
HOW YOU DOING?

1107
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:58,916
? IN A NEW YORK MINUTE ?

1108
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:01,819
? OOH ?

1109
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,821
? EVERYTHING CAN CHANGE ?

1110
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,423
? IN A NEW YORK MINUTE ?

1111
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:09,426
? OOH ?

1112
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,428
? THINGS CAN GET A LITTLE STRANGE ?

1113
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:13,831
