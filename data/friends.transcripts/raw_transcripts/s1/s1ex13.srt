1
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:16,116

2
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,317
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

3
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:18,518
THAT IS IT!

4
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,719
YOU JUST BARGE IN HERE.

5
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:20,520
YOU DON'T KNOCK.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,721
I'M SORRY.

7
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:22,922
YOU HAVE NO RESPECT FOR ANYBODY'S PRIVACY!

8
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:24,924
RACHEL, WAIT. NO! YOU WAIT!

9
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:26,326
CAN I JUST SAY ONE THING?

10
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:27,527
WHAT?! WHAT?!

11
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,329
THAT'S A RELATIVELY OPEN WEAVE

12
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,331
AND I CAN STILL SEE YOUR...

13
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,932
NIPPULAR AREA.

14
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:33,733
OH!

15
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:34,934
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

16
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:36,136
I COULD. I COULD.

30
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,087
OH, HONEY, HONEY

31
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,688
TELL THEM THE STORY ABOUT YOUR PATIENT

32
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,690
WHO THINKS THINGS ARE LIKE OTHER THINGS

33
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,891
YOU KNOW?

34
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,895
SO, LIKE WHEN THE PHONE RINGS AND SHE TAKES A SHOWER.

35
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,499
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.

36
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:40,700
OOPS.

37
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,103
BUT YOU TELL IT REALLY WELL, SWEETIE.

38
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,304
THANKS.

39
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:45,505
OKAY.

40
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,907
NOW GO AWAY SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT YOU.

41
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,310
OKAY. I'LL MISS YOU.

42
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,113
ISN'T HE GREAT?

43
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,314
HE'S SO CUTE.

44
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,116
AND HE SEEMS TO LIKE YOU SO MUCH.

45
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,417
I KNOW. I KNOW.

46
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,520
HE'S SO SWEET, OH, AND SO COMPLICATED, YOU KNOW.

47
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,323
AND FOR A SHRINK, HE'S NOT TOO SHRINKY.

48
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:06,126
SO YOU THINK YOU'LL DO IT ON HIS COUCH?

49
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:06,926
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

50
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,428
I DON'T KNOW.

51
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,430
I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE WEIRD, YOU KNOW.

52
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,031
IT'S VINYL.

53
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,135
OKAY. YOU GUYS WANT ANYTHING ELSE?

54
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,736
OH, YES, COULD I HAVE..?

55
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,738
NO. I'M SORRY, WE'RE ALL OUT OF THOSE.

56
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:19,939
ANYBODY ELSE?

57
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,742
DID I, UH, DID I MISS SOMETHING BETWEEN...?

58
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:26,546
NO. SHE'S STILL UPSET BECAUSE I SAW HER BOOBIES.

59
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:29,749
WHAT WERE YOU DOING SEEING HER BOOBIES?

60
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:30,950
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

61
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,552
IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS ACROSS THE STREET

62
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,154
WITH A TELESCOPE AND A BOX OF DOUGHNUTS.

63
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,655
OKAY, OKAY.

64
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,657
COULD WE CHANGE THE SUBJECT, PLEASE?

65
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,460
YEAH. YOU KNOW, THESE ARE NOT HER BOOBIES.

66
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,061
THESE ARE HER BREASTS.

67
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,464
OKAY, PHEEBS.

68
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,667
I WAS HOPING OF MORE OF A CHANGE.

69
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,369
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS LIKED "BAZOOMBAS."

70
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,572
KIND OF GIVES THEM A LATIN SPIN.

71
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,076
CAN WE, CAN WE DR DROP THIS ALREADY, PLEASE?

72
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,879
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE SO EMBARRASSED.

73
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,481
THEY WERE VERY NICE BOOBIES.

74
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,583
NICE?

75
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,784
THEY WERE NICE?

76
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,786
I MEAN, THAT'S IT.

77
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,788
I MEAN, MITTENS ARE NICE.

78
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,890
OKAY.

79
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,091
ROCK.

80
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,293
HARD PLACE.

81
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,494
ME.

82
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,896

83
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,699
YOU'RE... YOU'RE...

84
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,900
YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

85
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,703
HE'S REALLY FUNNY.

86
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,506
OF COURSE, I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE THERE

87
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,508
WHEN THE LAUGHTER STOPS.

88
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,810
WHOA, WHOA. BACK UP THERE, SPARKY.

89
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,214
WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?

90
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,216
IT JUST SEEMS AS THOUGH

91
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,218
THAT MAYBE YOU HAVE INTIMACY ISSUES

92
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,819
THAT YOU USE YOUR HUMOR

93
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,421
AS A WAY OF KEEPING

94
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,022
PEOPLE AT A DISTANCE.

95
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,924
HUH.

96
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,125
I MEAN, HEY, I JUST MET YOU.

97
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,727
I DON'T KNOW YOU FROM ADAM.

98
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,830
ONLY CHILD, RIGHT?

99
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,234
PARENTS DIVORCED BEFORE YOU HIT PUBERTY.

100
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,336
UH HUH.

101
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,338
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

102
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,039
IT'S TEXTBOOK.

103
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,344
HEY, YOU GUYS.

104
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,945
YOU ALL KNOW MY DAD.

105
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,947
HEY, HOW LONG YOU IN THE CITY?

106
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,149
JUST FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. I GOT A JOB MIDTOWN.

107
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,552
I FIGURE I'M BETTER OFF STAYING WITH THE KID

108
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,954
THAN HAULING MY ASS BACK AND FORTH ON A FERRY.

109
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,155
I DON'T KNOW THIS ONE.

110
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,857
OH. THIS IS MY FRIEND ROGER.

111
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,058
HI.

112
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,660
HEY, GOOD TO MEET YOU, ROGER.

113
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,861
YOU, TOO, SIR.

114
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,863
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PUPPET GUY?

115
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:24,964
DAD.

116
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,966
OH, OH. EXCUSE ME.

117
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,769
SO, ROSS, HOW'S THE WIFE?

118
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,771

119
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,773
"O" FOR TWO, HUH?

120
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,576
CHANDLER, QUICK, SAY SOMETHING FUNNY.

121
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:46,686
I GOT TO GO.

122
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,288
MISS YOU, TOO.

123
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,690
I LOVE YOU, BUT IT'S GETTING REAL LATE.

124
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,891
LET ME SAY HI.

125
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,893
HEY, MA, LISTEN.

126
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:57,497
I MADE THE APPOINTMENT WITH DR. BOZITA AND...

127
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,698
EXCUSE ME.

128
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,903
DID YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T MA?

129
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,414
HER NAME'S RONNI.

130
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,517
SHE'S A PET MORTICIAN.

131
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,622
SURE.

132
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,024
SO HOW LONG YOU BEEN...?

133
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,429
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE A KID

134
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,030
I USED TO TAKE YOU TO THE NAVY YARD

135
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,632
AND SHOW YOU THE BIG SHIPS?

136
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:33,833
SINCE THEN?

137
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,835
NO. IT'S ONLY BEEN SIX YEARS.

138
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,038
I JUST WANTED TO PUT A NICE MEMORY IN YOUR HEAD

139
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,040
SO YOU'D KNOW THAT I WASN'T ALWAYS

140
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,443
SUCH A TERRIBLE GUY.

141
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,644
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

142
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:45,845
CHOPPING GARLIC.

143
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,046
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CRUSH IT?

144
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,048
HEY, YOU'RE HAVING AN AFFAIR;

145
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,050
I'M CHOPPING THE GARLIC.

146
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,251
IT'S A WACKY WORLD.

147
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:55,855
JOE, YOU EVER BEEN IN LOVE?

148
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,658
I DON'T KNOW.

149
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,259
THEN YOU HAVEN'T.

150
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,662
YOU'RE BURNING YOUR TOMATOES.

151
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,263
YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

152
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,967
JOE, YOUR DAD'S IN LOVE BIG TIME

153
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,969
AND THE WORST PART OF IT IS

154
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,971
IT'S WITH TWO DIFFERENT WOMEN.

155
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,774
OH, MAN, PLEASE TELL ME ONE OF THEM IS MA.

156
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:15,975
OF COURSE.

157
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,378
OF COURSE ONE OF THEM'S MA.

158
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,580
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

159
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,588
IT'S LIKE IF YOU WOKE UP ONE DAY

160
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,791
AND FOUND OUT YOUR DAD WAS LEADING THIS DOUBLE LIFE.

161
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:36,696
HE'S, LIKE, ACTUALLY SOME SPY WORKING FOR THE C.I.A.

162
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,297
THAT WOULD BE COOL.

163
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,299
THIS BLOWS.

164
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:43,403
DO YOU THINK DAD EVER CHEATED ON MOM?

165
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,303
WELL, NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

166
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,305
BECAUSE THAT WOULD INVOLVE HAVING SEX

167
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,307
AND I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT OUR PARENTS

168
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,509
DON'T DO THAT SORT OF THING.

169
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,613

170
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,914
YEAH. I KNOW.

171
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,916
I MEAN, WHY CAN'T PARENTS JUST STAY PARENTS?

172
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,118
WHY DO THEY HAVE TO BECOME PEOPLE?

173
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,521
WHY DO THEY HAVE..?

174
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,323
WHY...

175
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:07,927
CAN'T YOU STOP STARING AT MY BREASTS?

176
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,730
WHAT?

177
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,533
WHAT?

178
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,734
DID YOU NOT GET

179
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,136
A GOOD ENOUGH LOOK THE OTHER DAY?

180
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,538
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

181
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,139
WE'RE ALL ADULTS HERE.

182
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,542
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO RESOLVE THIS.

183
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,243
SINCE YOU SAW HER BOOBIES

184
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,046
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

185
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,349
TO SHOW HER YOUR PEE PEE.

186
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,958
YOU KNOW, I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING.

187
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,960
COME ON. HE'S RIGHT.

188
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,161
TIT FOR TAT.

189
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,869
WELL, I'M NOT SHOWING YOU MY TAT.

190
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,971

191
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:53,673
HELLO.

192
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,274
It's Phoebe.

193
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,276
 And Rog.

194
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,878
COME ON UP.

195
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,179
OH, GOOD.

196
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,781
ROG IS HERE.

197
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,083
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ROG?

198
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,685
AH, IT'S NOTHING.

199
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,286
IT'S A LITTLE THING.

200
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,888
I HATE THAT GUY.

201
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,290
ALL RIGHT, SO HE WAS A LITTLE ANALYTICAL.

202
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,892
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES, YOU KNOW?

203
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,894
COME ON, HE'S NOT THAT BAD.

204
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,295
YOU SEE, THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.

205
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,897
WHY WOULD I MARRY HER

206
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:21,100
IF I THOUGHT ON ANY LEVEL THAT SHE WAS A LESBIAN?

207
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,401
I DON'T KNOW.

208
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,204
MAYBE YOU WANTED YOUR MARRIAGE TO FAIL.

209
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,010
WHY?

210
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,612
WHY WOULD I?

211
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,213
WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY?

212
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,815
I DON'T KNOW.

213
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:36,616
MAYBE...

214
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,618
MAYBE LOW SELF ESTEEM.

215
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:43,122
MAYBE TO COMPENSATE FOR OVERSHADOWING A SIBLING.

216
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,925
WAIT. GO BACK TO THAT SIBLING THING.

217
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,126
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

218
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,728
IT'S CONCEIVABLE

219
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,930
THAT YOU WANTED TO SABOTAGE YOUR MARRIAGE

220
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,932
SO THAT THE SIBLING WOULD FEEL LIKE

221
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,735
LESS OF A FAILURE IN THE EYES OF THE PARENTS.

222
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,137

223
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,940
THAT'S... THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

224
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,342
I DON'T FEEL GUILTY FOR HER FAILURES.

225
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,747
SO YOU THINK I'M A FAILURE.

226
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:08,948
ISN'T HE GOOD?

227
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,049
YEAH.

228
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,451
NO, NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS SAYING.

229
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,653
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, ALL THESE YEARS

230
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:14,854
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ON MY SIDE

231
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,055
BUT MAYBE WHAT YOU WERE DOING

232
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,256
WAS SUCKING UP TO MOM AND DAD

233
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,457
SO THEY'D KEEP LIKING YOU BETTER.

234
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,360
HEY, I MARRIED A LESBIAN TO MAKE YOU LOOK GOOD!

235
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,366
YOU'RE RIGHT.

236
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,968
I MEAN, YOU'RE RIGHT.

237
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,570
IT WASN'T JUST THE WEEBLES

238
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,972
BUT IT WAS THE WEEBLE PLAY PALACE

239
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,574
AND...

240
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,976
AND THE WEEBLES CRUISE SHIP--

241
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,978
OH, WHICH HAD THIS LITTLE LIFEBOAT

242
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,380
FOR THE WEEBLES TO WOBBLE IN.

243
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,986
AND AND MOM JUST GAVE THEM ALL AWAY.

244
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:47,987
THAT'S TOUGH, TOUGH STUFF.

245
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,188
COME ON, PHEEPS.

246
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,790
IF WE'RE GOING TO CATCH THAT MOVIE

247
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,391
WE GOT TO GET GOING.

248
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,794
OKAY. FEEL BETTER, RACHEL, OKAY?

249
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,796
PHEEBS, WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE, SWEETIE.

250
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,198
OKAY. LISTEN, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING, MON.

251
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,399
NO PROBLEM.

252
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,602
LISTEN, GUYS, IT WAS GREAT SEEING YOU AGAIN.

253
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,704
YEAH.

254
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,807
MON, EASY ON THOSE COOKIES, OKAY?

255
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,809
REMEMBER, THEY'RE JUST FOOD.

256
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,211
THEY'RE NOT LOVE.

257
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,516
I HATE THAT GUY.

258
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,122
 GOOD NIGHT, YOU GUYS.

259
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,926
OH, LOOK.

260
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,928
IT'S THE WOMAN WE ORDERED.

261
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,334
HEY. CAN WE HELP YOU?

262
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,235
AW, NO, THANKS.

263
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,638
I'M JUST WAITING FOR JOEY TRIBBIANI.

264
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,440
I'M JOEY TRIBBIANI.

265
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,843
OH, NO, NOT YOU.

266
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,344
BIG JOEY.

267
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,545
OH, MY GOD.

268
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,749
YOU'RE SO MUCH CUTER THAN YOUR PICTURES.

269
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,552
I'M RONNI.

270
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,556
CHEESE NIP?

271
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,961
UH... JOEY'S HAVING AN EMBOLISM

272
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,963
BUT I'D GO FOR A NIP.

273
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,765
YOU KNOW?

274
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,472
NOW, YOU SEE, MOST PEOPLE, WHEN THEIR PETS PASS ON

275
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,275
THEY WANT THEM SORT OF LAID OUT LIKE THEY'RE SLEEPING.

276
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:19,879
BUT, OCCASIONALLY, YOU GET YOUR PERSON WHO WANTS THEM IN A POSE

277
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,882
LIKE, AH, CHASING THEIR TAIL...

278
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:27,286
OR JUMPING TO CATCH A FRISBEE.

279
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,688
JOEY, IF I GO FIRST

280
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,490
I WANT TO BE LOOKING FOR MY KEYS.

281
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,893
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

282
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:34,694
HEY, JOE.

283
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,295
DAD, RONNI'S HERE.

284
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,096
HUH?

285
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:37,897
HI.

286
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,498
HEY.

287
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,100
HELLO, BABE.

288
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,301
WHAT ARE...

289
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,303
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

290
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,504
OH, UH...

291
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,506
WELL, YOU LEFT YOUR GOOD HAIR AT MY APARTMENT.

292
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,909
I FIGURED YOU'D NEED IT TOMORROW FOR YOUR MEETING.

293
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,813
THANK YOU.

294
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:58,317
SO, WHO'S UP FOR A BIG GAME OF KERPLUNK?

295
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,823
LOOK, I, UH... I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME.

296
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,024
I BETTER GET GOING.

297
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,426
I DON'T WANT TO MISS THE LAST TRAIN.

298
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,627
NO, NO, HON.

299
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:10,629
I DON'T WANT YOU TAKING THAT THING THIS LATE.

300
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,231
OH, WHERE AM I GOING TO STAY, HERE?

301
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,933
WHOA HO.

302
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,935
WE'LL GO TO A HOTEL.

303
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,337
WE'LL GO TO A HOTEL.

304
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:19,939
NO, YOU WON'T.

305
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,540
NO, WE WON'T.

306
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,542
IF YOU GO TO A HOTEL

307
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,744
YOU'LL BE... DOING STUFF.

308
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,345
I WANT YOU RIGHT HERE

309
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,347
WHERE I CAN KEEP AN EYE ON YOU.

310
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,349
YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP AN EYE ON US?

311
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,250
THAT'S RIGHT, MISTER.

312
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,252
AND I DON'T CARE HOW OLD YOU ARE.

313
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,254
AS LONG AS YOU'RE UNDER MY ROOF

314
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,656
YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE BY MY RULES. OKAY?

315
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:43,462
AND THAT MEANS NO SLEEPING WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

316
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,766
WOW. HE'S STRICT.

317
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,768
NOW, DAD, YOU'LL BE IN MY ROOM.

318
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,770
RONNI, YOU CAN STAY IN CHANDLER'S ROOM.

319
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,172
AND CHANDLER WILL BE...?

320
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,674
OUT HERE WITH ME, BUNKING UP ON THE HIDE A BED.

321
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,176
OOH, "BUNKING UP."

322
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,379
IF YOU SMELL S'MORES, DON'T BE ALARMED.

323
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,982
THANKS. YOU'RE, UH... YOU'RE A GOOD KID.

324
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,483
COME ON.

325
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,385
I'LL SHOW YOU TO MY ROOM.

326
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,588
THAT SOUNDS SO WEIRD WHEN IT'S NOT FOLLOWED BY

327
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,590
"NO, THANKS. IT'S LATE."

328
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,594
OKAY, NOW THIS IS JUST FOR TONIGHT.

329
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,397
STARTING TOMORROW, YOU GOT TO MAKE A CHANGE.

330
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,999
SIX YEARS IS LONG ENOUGH.

331
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,100
WHAT KIND OF CHANGE?

332
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,701
EITHER YOU BREAK IT OFF WITH RONNI...

333
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:23,402
I CAN'T DO THAT.

334
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,004
THEN YOU GOT TO COME CLEAN WITH MA.

335
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,205
THIS IS NOT RIGHT.

336
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,406
YEAH, BUT THIS...

337
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,408
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

338
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,811
NOW GO TO MY ROOM.

339
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:46,725
HEY, KICKY...

340
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,027
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

341
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,029
JUST TRYING TO GET COMFORTABLE.

342
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,031
I CAN'T SLEEP IN MY UNDERWEAR.

343
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,033
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA.

344
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,840
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

345
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,642
YOU KNOW, ABOUT HOW I'M ALWAYS SEEING

346
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:06,045
GIRLS ON TOP OF GIRLS.

347
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,650
ARE THEY END TO END OR TALL LIKE PANCAKES?

348
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,852
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

349
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,654
ABOUT HOW I'M ALWAYS GOING OUT WITH ALL THESE WOMEN.

350
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,256
BECAUSE I ALWAYS FIGURED

351
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,858
WHEN THE RIGHT ONE COMES ALONG

352
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,459
I'D BE ABLE TO BE STAND UP GUY

353
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,061
AND GO THE DISTANCE, YOU KNOW?

354
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,463
NOW I'M LOOKING AT MY DAD, THINKING...

355
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:25,865
HEY, YOU'RE NOT HIM; YOU'RE YOU.

356
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,066
WHEN THEY WERE ALL OVER YOU

357
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:31,070
TO GO INTO YOUR FATHER'S PIPE- FITTING BUSINESS, DID YOU CAVE?

358
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,271
NO.

359
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,072
NO. YOU DECIDED

360
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,474
TO GO INTO THE OUT OF WORK ACTOR BUSINESS

361
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,877
AND THAT WASN'T EASY, BUT YOU DID IT

362
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,279
AND I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT WHEN

363
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:44,083
THE RIGHT WOMAN COMES ALONG, YOU WILL HAVE THE COURAGE

364
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,286
AND THE GUTS TO SAY, "NO, THANKS. I'M MARRIED."

365
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,294
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

366
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,596
YEAH, I REALLY DO.

367
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:58,797
THANKS, CHANDLER.

368
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:00,799
GET OFF.

369
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:07,706

370
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,212
HI. HI.

371
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,413
MAY I HELP YOU?

372
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,216
YEAH. JOEY SAID I COULD USE YOUR SHOWER

373
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,817
SINCE CHANDLER'S IN OURS.

374
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,620
OKAY... WHO ARE YOU?

375
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,522
OH! I'M RONNI.

376
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,124
RONNI RAPPELANO.

377
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,225
THE MISTRESS.

378
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,229
UM, COME ON IN.

379
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,430
OH, THANKS.

380
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,331
I'M RACHEL. HI.

381
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,333
BATHROOM'S UP THERE. HEY, LISTEN, RONNI.

382
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,136
HOW LONG WOULD YOU SAY CHANDLER'S BEEN IN THE SHOWER?

383
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,138
OH, LIKE, UH, FIVE MINUTES.

384
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,941
PERFECT.

385
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,343
FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS.

386
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:47,947
IT'S PEE PEE TIME.

387
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,752
HEY, MR. TRIB.

388
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,956
HEY. GOOD MORNING, DEAR.

389
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:01,160
CHANDLER BING, IT'S TIME TO SEE YOUR THING.

390
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,170

391
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,572
 WHAT'S THE MATTER

392
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,573
WITH YOU?!

393
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,175
I THOUGHT IT WAS CHANDLER!

394
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,076
WHAT? WHAT?

395
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,178
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE IN THERE

396
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,180
SO I COULD SEE YOUR THING!

397
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,684
SORRY. MY THING WAS IN THERE WITH ME.

398
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,492
HEY, PHEEBS. HEY, PHEEBS.

399
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,494
HOW'S IT GOING?

400
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,696
GOOD. OH, OH, ROGER'S HAVING A DINNER THING

401
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,698
AND HE WANTED ME TO INVITE YOU GUYS.

402
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,000

403
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,404
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

404
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,006
NOTHING. IT'S, UM...

405
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,008
IT'S JUST, UH...

406
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,010
IT'S ROGER.

407
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:51,910
UM...

408
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,812
I DON'T KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT...

409
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,215
BASICALLY, WE JUST FEEL THAT HE'S, UH...

410
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,416
WE HATE THAT GUY.

411
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,118
WE HATE HIM.

412
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,919
WE'RE SORRY, PHEEBS.

413
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,321
UH HUH, OKAY.

414
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:05,124
DON'T YOU THINK MAYBE, THOUGH, THAT IT'S JUST

415
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,327
THAT HE'S SO PERCEPTIVE THAT IT FREAKED YOU OUT?

416
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,928
 NO, WE HATE HIM.

417
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,230
I'M SORRY.

418
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,638

419
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,045
MA! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

420
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,047
I CAME TO GIVE YOU THIS

421
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,648
AND THIS!

422
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,650
OW! BIG RING.

423
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,053
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO FILL YOUR FATHER'S HEAD

424
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,855
WITH ALL THAT GARBAGE ABOUT MAKING THINGS RIGHT?

425
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,457
THINGS WERE FINE

426
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,758
THE WAY THEY WERE.

427
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,760
THERE'S CHICKEN IN THERE.

428
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,062
PUT IT AWAY.

429
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,064
FOR GOD'S SAKE, JOEY.

430
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,866
REALLY!

431
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,068
HOLD ON.

432
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,269
YOU KNEW?

433
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,370
OF COURSE I KNEW!

434
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,571
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

435
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,973
YOUR FATHER IS NO JAMES BOND.

436
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,376
YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD SOME OF HIS COVER STORIES.

437
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,778
"I'M SLEEPING OVER AT MY ACCOUNTANT'S."

438
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,380
I MEAN, WHAT IS THAT?

439
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,581
PLEASE!

440
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,583
SO, THEN, HOW COULD YOU...?

441
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,386
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOUR FATHER USED TO BE?

442
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,388
ALWAYS YELLING. ALWAYS YELLING.

443
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,989
NOTHING MADE HIM HAPPY.

444
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,591
NOTHING MADE HIM HAPPY, NOTHING.

445
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,193
NOT THAT WOOD SHOP

446
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,895
NOT THOSE STUPID LITTLE SHIPS IN THE BOTTLE--

447
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,497
NOTHING. NOW HE'S HAPPY.

448
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,499
I MEAN, IT'S NICE. HE HAS A HOBBY.

449
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:24,503
MA, I DON'T MEAN TO BE DISRESPECTFUL, BUT...

450
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:28,107
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

451
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,210
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

452
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,811
ME? I'M FINE.

453
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,813
LOOK, HONEY...

454
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:38,016
IN AN IDEAL WORLD, THERE'D BE NO HER

455
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,819
AND YOUR FATHER WOULD LOOK LIKE STING.

456
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,222
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE--

457
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:47,326
EVER SINCE THAT POODLE STUFFER CAME ALONG

458
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,529
HE'S BEEN SO ASHAMED OF HIMSELF

459
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,931
THAT HE'S BEEN MORE ATTENTIVE.

460
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,933
HE'S BEEN MORE LOVING.

461
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,736
IT'S LIKE EVERY DAY'S OUR ANNIVERSARY.

462
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,539
I'M... HAPPY FOR YOU?

463
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,941
WELL, DON'T BE.

464
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,943
BECAUSE NOW EVERYTHING'S SCREWED UP.

465
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:09,348
I JUST WANT IT THE WAY IT WAS.

466
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,951
MA, I'M SORRY.

467
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:16,555
I... I JUST DID WHAT I THOUGHT YOU'D WANT.

468
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,957
I KNOW YOU DID, COOKIE.

469
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,360
OH, I KNOW YOU DID.

470
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,365
SO TELL ME...

471
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,367
DID YOU SEE HER?

472
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,369
YEAH.

473
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,970
HMM.

474
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,773
YOU'RE TEN TIMES PRETTIER THAN SHE IS.

475
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,176
THAT'S SWEET.

476
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,178
COULD I TAKE HER?

477
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,580
HUH... WITH THIS RING?

478
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,182
NO CONTEST.

479
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,795
OH! OH! NO! DON'T EVER DO THAT, EVER!

480
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,397
WHY? OH, I'M SORRY.

481
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,998
I'M SORRY, I JUST... I HAVE A THING.

482
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,000
I HAVE A THING, WHICH MEANS YOU CAN'T EVER DO THAT.

483
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,004
WHY? WHAT'S WRONG, SWEETIE?

484
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,206
NOTHING. NOTHING.

485
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,208
NO, NO, NO. WHAT'S WRONG? COME ON.

486
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,009
OH, OKAY.

487
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:17,015
IT'S... I MEAN, IT'S NOTHING. I'M FINE.

488
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,818
IT'S JUST, UM... IT'S MY FRIENDS.

489
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,822
THEY HAVE A LIKING PROBLEM WITH YOU

490
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:27,025
IN THAT, UM, THEY DON'T.

491
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:30,629
OH. THEY DON'T?

492
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,031
BUT, YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T SEE

493
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,633
ALL THE WONDERFULNESS THAT I SEE.

494
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,035
YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T SEE ALL THE GOOD STUFF

495
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,237
AND ALL THE SWEET STUFF.

496
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,039
THEY JUST, YOU KNOW, THEY THINK YOU'RE A LITTLE...

497
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,641
WHAT?

498
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,643
INTENSE AND CREEPY.

499
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,347
OH.

500
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,147
BUT I DON'T.

501
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,149
ME, PHOEBE.

502
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,552
WELL, I'M NOT AT ALL SURPRISED

503
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,554
THEY FEEL THAT WAY.

504
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,156
YOU'RE NOT? SEE, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SO GREAT.

505
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:01,960
ACTUALLY, IT'S QUITE TYPICAL BEHAVIOR WHEN YOU HAVE

506
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,163
THIS KIND OF DYSFUNCTIONAL GROUP DYNAMIC.

507
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,668
YOU KNOW, THIS KIND OF CO- DEPENDENT, EMOTIONALLY STUNTED

508
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,070
SITTING IN YOUR STUPID COFFEE HOUSE

509
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,473
WITH YOUR STUPID BIG CUPS

510
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:18,076
WHICH, I'M SORRY, MIGHT AS WELL HAVE NIPPLES ON THEM

511
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,978
AND YOU'RE ALL, LIKE

512
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:23,181
"OH, DEFINE ME!

513
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,783
"DEFINE ME!

514
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,186
LOVE ME! I NEED LOVE!"

515
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,789
SO YOU TALKED TO YOUR DAD, HUH?

516
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,791
YEAH, HE'S GOING TO KEEP CHEATING ON MY MA

517
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,992
LIKE SHE WANTED

518
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,395
MY MA'S GOING TO KEEP PRETENDING SHE DOESN'T KNOW

519
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,596
EVEN THOUGH SHE DOES

520
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,399
AND MY LITTLE SISTER, TINA, CAN'T SEE HER HUSBAND ANYMORE

521
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,401
BECAUSE HE GOT A RESTRAINING ORDER.

522
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,504
WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING

523
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,506
EXCEPT THAT I FOUND OUT TODAY.

524
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,908
THINGS SURE HAVE CHANGED

525
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,810
HERE ON WALTON'S MOUNTAIN.

526
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,812
SO, JOE, ARE YOU OKAY?

527
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,614
YEAH, I GUESS.

528
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:58,016
IT'S JUST... YOU KNOW, THEY'RE PARENTS.

529
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,419
AFTER A CERTAIN POINT, YOU GOT TO LET GO.

530
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,821
EVEN IF YOU KNOW BETTER

531
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:06,024
YOU GOT TO LET THEM MAKE THEIR OWN MISTAKES.

532
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,126
AND JUST THINK, IN A COUPLE OF YEARS

533
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,728
WE GET TO TURN INTO THEM.

534
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:10,929
OH, PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.

535
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,732
IF I TURN INTO MY PARENTS, I'LL EITHER BE

536
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:17,336
AN ALCOHOLIC BLONDE CHASING AFTER 20 YEAR OLD BOYS OR...

537
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,539
I'LL END UP LIKE MY MOM.

538
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,942
HEY.

539
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,944
 HEY, PHEEBS.

540
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,145
HOW'S IT GOING?

541
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,548
OH, OKAY, EXCEPT I BROKE UP WITH ROGER.

542
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,450
 OH.

543
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,452
YEAH, RIGHT.

544
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,154
NO, NO, NO. REALLY.

545
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,557
WHAT HAPPENED?

546
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:39,858
I DON'T KNOW.

547
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:45,063
I MEAN, HE'S A GOOD PERSON, AND HE CAN BE REALLY SWEET

548
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,967
AND IN SOME WAYS, I THINK HE IS SO RIGHT FOR ME.

549
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,370
IT'S JUST... I HATE THAT GUY.

550
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,878
HI, JOEY.

551
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,480
WHAT'S GOING ON?

552
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,482
CLEAR THE TRACKS

553
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,683
FOR THE BOOBIE PAYBACK EXPRESS.

554
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,284
NEXT STOP: RACHEL GREEN.

555
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,089

556
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,093
JOEY, WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU DOING?!

557
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:18,497
SORRY. WRONG BOOBIES.

558
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,010
HELLO, JOEY.

559
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,713
HUH? HELLO, DEAR.
