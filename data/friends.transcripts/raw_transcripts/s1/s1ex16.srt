1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:00,800

2
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:05,805
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

3
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,807
IT'S BEEN, LIKE, A HALF AN HOUR.

4
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:09,409
IF THIS WAS A CARTOON

5
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:13,113
YOU'D BE LOOKING LIKE A HAM RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

6
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:15,115
OH, THERE'S THE WAITRESS. EXCUSE ME, MISS?

7
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,516
HELLO? MISS?

8
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,717
IT'S PHOEBE.

9
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:18,918
HI. HI.

10
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:20,520
HI.

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,522
OKAY, WILL THAT BE ALL?

12
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,425
WAIT, WAIT. WH WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,427
YEAH, UM, I WAS OVER THERE, AND THEN YOU SAID

14
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:28,628
"EXCUSE ME. HELLO? MISS?"

15
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:29,829
SO NOW I'M HERE.

16
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:33,033
NO, NO. HOW COME YOU'RE WORKING HERE?

17
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,435
RIGHT, YEAH. BECAUSE IT'S CLOSE TO WHERE I LIVE

18
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,437
AND THE APRONS ARE REALLY CUTE, SO...

19
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:38,738
CAN WE START OVER?

20
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,340
YEAH, OKAY, GREAT, I'M GOING TO BE

21
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,541
OVER HERE. NO, NO, NO, NO!

35
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,993
SO, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE'S TESTING ME OR JUST ACTING OUT

36
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:36,696
BUT MY MONKEY IS OUT OF CONTROL.

37
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,298
BUT HE KEEPS ERASING

38
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:42,302
THE MESSAGES ON MY MACHINE.

39
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,105
SUPPOSEDLY BY ACCIDENT.

40
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,906
OH, YEAH-- I'VE DONE THAT.

41
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,909
AND THEN, LIKE, THREE DAYS IN A ROW

42
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,712
HE GOT TO THE NEWSPAPER BEFORE I DID

43
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,115
AND PEED ALL OVER THE CROSSWORD.

44
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,418
I'VE NEVER DONE THAT.

45
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:01,221
AND THEN LAST NIGHT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DID

46
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,223
BUT THERE WERE CAPERS EVERYWHERE.

47
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,926
ALL RIGHT, NOW, LOOK AT HER AND TELL ME

48
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,329
SHE DOESN'T LOOK EXACTLY LIKE HER SISTER.

49
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,232
I'M SAYING I SEE A DIFFERENCE.

50
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,833
THEY'RE TWINS.

51
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,435
I DON'T CARE. PHOEBE'S PHOEBE.

52
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,036
URSULA'S... HOT.

53
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:18,538
YOU KNOW THAT THING

54
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,540
WHEN YOU AND I TALK TO EACH OTHER ABOUT THINGS?

55
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,741
YEAH.

56
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:24,144
LET'S NOT DO THAT ANYMORE.

57
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,745
HI, GUYS.

58
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,948
HEY, PHEEBS, GUESS WHO WE SAW TODAY.

59
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,950
OOH! OH, FUN! OKAY, UM...

60
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,851
LIAM NEESON?

61
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:32,452
NO.

62
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,553
MORLEY SAFER? NO.

63
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,955
THE WOMAN WHO CUTS MY HAIR? NO.

64
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,358
OKAY, LOOK, THIS COULD BE A REALLY LONG GAME.

65
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,559
YOUR SISTER URSULA.

66
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,661
OH, REALLY?

67
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,463
YEAH, YEAH. SHE WORKS OVER AT THAT PLACE...

68
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,665
RIFF'S. YEAH, I KNOW. OH, YOU DO?

69
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,867
BECAUSE SHE SAID YOU GUYS HAVEN'T TALKED IN, LIKE, YEARS.

70
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:51,171
MM HMM. YEAH.

71
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:55,175
SO, UM, IS SHE FAT?

72
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,778
NOT FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING.

73
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,380
WHERE WERE YOU STANDING?

74
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,586
UM, PHEEBS, SO YOU GUYS JUST DON'T GET ALONG?

75
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,588
IT'S MOSTLY JUST DUMB SISTER STUFF, YOU KNOW?

76
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,990
I MEAN, LIKE EVERYONE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF HER

77
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,992
AS THE PRETTY ONE, YOU KNOW, AND...

78
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,494
OH, OH... SHE WAS

79
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,396
THE FIRST ONE TO START WALKING

80
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,599
EVEN THOUGH I DID IT... LATER THAT SAME DAY.

81
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,201
BUT TO MY PARENTS

82
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,705
BY THEN IT WAS LIKE, "YEAH, RIGHT. WELL, WHAT ELSE IS NEW?"

83
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,107
OH... PHEEBS, I'M SORRY-- I'VE GOT TO GO.

84
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,709
I'VE GOT LAMAZE CLASS.

85
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,512
OH, AND I'VE GOT EARTH SCIENCE

86
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,113
BUT I'LL CATCH YOU IN GYM?

87
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,418
SO IS THIS JUST GOING TO BE YOU AND CAROL?

88
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,420
NO. SUSAN'S GOING TO BE THERE, TOO.

89
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,422
WE'VE GOT DADS, WE'VE GOT LESBIANS--

90
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,625
THE WHOLE PARENTING TEAM.

91
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,427
WELL, ISN'T THAT GOING TO BE WEIRD?

92
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,329
NO, NO. I MEAN, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AT FIRST

93
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,532
BUT BY NOW, I THINK I'M PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH THE WHOLE SITUATION.

94
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,633
ROSS, THAT'S MY JACKET.

95
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,235
I KNOW. I KNOW.

96
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,844
HI. WE'RE THE ROSTINS.

97
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,846
I'M J.C.

98
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,448
AND HE'S MICHAEL.

99
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,651
AND WE'RE HAVING A BOY... AND A GIRL.

100
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,253
GOOD FOR YOU.

101
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,255
ALL RIGHTY. NEXT?

102
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,258
HI. UM, I'M, UH...

103
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,260
I'M ROSS GELLER

104
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,062
AND THAT'S... THAT'S MY BOY IN THERE.

105
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,664
AND THIS IS CAROL WILLICK

106
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:29,068
AND THIS... IS SUSAN BUNCH.

107
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,070
SUSAN IS, UM... CAROL'S...

108
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,473

109
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,778
WHO'S NEXT?

110
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,980
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T GET...

111
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,181
SUSAN IS...?

112
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,983
SUSAN'S CAROL'S... CAROL'S... FRIEND.

113
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,184
LIFE PARTNER. LIKE BUDDIES.

114
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,087
LIKE LOVERS.

115
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,790
YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE WOMEN CAN GET.

116
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,891
SUSAN AND I

117
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:52,892
LIVE TOGETHER.

118
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,494
ALTHOUGH I WAS MARRIED TO HER.

119
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,095
CAROL, NOT ME. UH, RIGHT.

120
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,697
IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED. A LITTLE.

121
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,299
BUT WE'RE FINE. ABSOLUTELY.

122
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,101
SO TWINS?

123
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,103
THAT'S, LIKE, TWO BIRTHS.

124
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,608
OUCH!

125
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,314

126
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,517
AND...  TO YOU TOO, HELEN.

127
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,320
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.

128
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,322
OH, OKAY. SEND HER IN.

129
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,328
HI.

130
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,729
HI, NINA. COME ON IN.

131
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,331
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME? UH, YES.

132
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,333
YES. I WAS JUST GOING OVER YOUR DATA HERE

133
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,135
AND A LITTLE THING-- YOU'VE BEEN POSTDATING YOUR FRIDAY NUMBERS.

134
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,438
WHICH IS BAD, BECAUSE...?

135
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,440
WELL, IT THROWS MY WENUS OUT OF WHACK.

136
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,842
YOUR... EXCUSE ME?

137
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,244
WENUS-- WEEKLY ESTIMATED NET...

138
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:46,846
OH! NET USAGE STATISTICS. RIGHT.

139
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,248
GOTCHA. GOTCHA.

140
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,850
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

141
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,454
I WOULDN'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING TO HURT YOUR... WENUS.

142
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,856

143
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:02,462
OKAY, I'LL TAKE "IDIOTS IN THE WORKPLACE" FOR $200 DOLLARS, ALEX.

144
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,563
OKAY, IT'S NOT...

145
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,565
IT'S NOT JUST THAT SHE'S CUTE, OKAY?

146
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,766
IT'S JUST THAT...

147
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,569
SHE'S REALLY, REALLY CUTE.

148
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,971
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

149
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,575
YOU DON'T DIP YOUR PEN IN THE COMPANY INK.

150
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,577
OH, GOD, I EVEN KNOW THAT

151
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,979
AND I'M PRETTY MUCH UNEMPLOYABLE.

152
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,685
ROSS, YOUR LITTLE CREATURE'S GOT THE REMOTE AGAIN.

153
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:29,288
MARCEL, MARCEL, GIVE ROSSY THE REMOTE.

154
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,592
MARCEL...

155
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,995
MARCEL, YOU GIVE ROSSY THE REMOTE RIGHT NOW.

156
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:39,999

157
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,001

158
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,703
GREAT.

159
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:44,904
RELAX. I'LL FIX IT.

160
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,406

161
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,007
OH, COOL.

162
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:52,812
"URKEL" IN SPANISH... IS "URKEL."

163
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:57,216
HOW DID HE DO THIS?

164
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,619
SO TELL ME SOMETHING-- IS LEAVING THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS UP

165
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,621
PART OF YOUR PLAN TO KEEP US MERRY

166
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,623
ALL YEAR LONG?

167
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,625
NO. SOMEONE WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE THEM DOWN

168
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,027
AROUND NEW YEAR'S, BUT OBVIOUSLY, SOMEONE FORGOT.

169
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,029
WELL, SOMEONE WAS SUPPOSED TO WRITE

170
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,031
"RACHE, TAKE DOWN THE LIGHTS"

171
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:16,035
AND PUT IT ON THE RE... FRIGERATOR.

172
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,838
HOW LONG HAS THAT BEEN THERE?

173
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,240
A REALLY LONG TIME.

174
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:23,743
HEY, WHERE YOU BEEN?

175
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,344
I WENT BACK TO RIFF'S.

176
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,946
I THINK URSULA LIKES ME.

177
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,548
ALL I ORDERED WAS COFFEE.

178
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:32,552
SHE BROUGHT ME A TUNA MELT AND FOUR PLATES OF CURLY FRIES.

179
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:36,155
SCORE.

180
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,558
SHE IS SO HOT!

181
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,360
YEAH, LISTEN, BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING JOEY LIKE

182
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,564
YOU MIGHT WANT TO RUN IT BY, UH...

183
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:45,665
YEAH?

184
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:46,466
YEAH.

185
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,667
YEAH.

186
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:48,868
PHEEBS? YEAH?

187
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,470
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE OKAY

188
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,472
IF I ASKED OUT YOUR SISTER?

189
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,875
WHY? WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT? WHY?

190
00:07:55,875 --> 00:08:00,079
WELL, SO THAT IF WE WENT OUT ON A DATE

191
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,881
SHE'D BE THERE.

192
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,887
WELL, I MEAN, I'M NOT MY SISTER'S

193
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,088
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER

194
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,591
AND, UH... I MEAN...

195
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:15,294
IT'S TRUE WE WERE ONE EGG ONCE, BUT, UH...

196
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,997
WE'VE... WE'VE GROWN APART, SO, UM...

197
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,399
I DON'T KNOW. WHY NOT? OKAY.

198
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,002
COOL. THANKS.

199
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,506
ARE YOU OKAY?

200
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,107
YEAH. I'M FINE.

201
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:30,910
YOU WANT TO WATCH LAVERNE Y SHIRLEY?

202
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,715
...cinco, seis, siete, ocho! Schlemiel! Schlamazel!

203
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,917

204
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,423

205
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,027
SORRY.

206
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,629
HI.

207
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:50,830
SORRY I'M LATE.

208
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,331
UH, WHERE'S... WHERE'S CAROL?

209
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,933
STUCK AT SCHOOL.

210
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,535
SOME PARENT TEACHER THING.

211
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,537
YOU CAN GO. I'LL GET THE INFORMATION.

212
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,738
NO...

213
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,740
NO, I THINK I SHOULD STAY.

214
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,943
I THINK WE SHOULD BOTH KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

215
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,445
OH, GOOD. THIS WILL BE FUN.

216
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,047
WE'RE GOING TO START

217
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:12,051
WITH SOME BASIC THIRD STAGE BREATHING EXERCISES

218
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,654
SO, MOMMIES, WHY DON'T YOU GET ON YOUR BACK

219
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:18,257
AND, COACHES, YOU SHOULD BE SUPPORTING MOMMY'S HEAD.

220
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,464
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?

221
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,867
I AM SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOMMY?

222
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:31,871
OKAY, I'M GOING TO PLAY MY SPERM CARD ONE MORE TIME.

223
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:35,875
I DON'T SEE WHY I SHOULD MISS OUT ON THE COACHING TRAINING

224
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,476
JUST BECAUSE I'M A WOMAN.

225
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,478
SO WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO?

226
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,480
I WILL FLIP YOU FOR IT.

227
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,883
NO, NO. HEADS.

228
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:47,086
ON YOUR BACK, MOM.

229
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,691
ALL RIGHT, MOMMIES.

230
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,093
TAKE A NICE, DEEP CLEANSING BREATH.

231
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,695

232
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,898
GOOD.

233
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,901
NOW IMAGINE YOUR VAGINA IS OPENING

234
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,203
LIKE A FLOWER.

235
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,812

236
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,215
MR. D., HOW'S IT GOING, SIR?

237
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,217
UH, IT'S BEEN BETTER.

238
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,520
THE ANNUAL NET USAGE STATISTICS ARE IN.

239
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,321
AND?

240
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,223
IT'S PRETTY UGLY.

241
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:29,028
WE HAVEN'T SEEN AN ANUS THIS BAD SINCE THE '70s.

242
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,129
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

243
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,631
WE'LL BE LAYING OFF PEOPLE

244
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,832
IN EVERY DEPARTMENT.

245
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,134
I KNOW I CAME IN LATE LAST WEEK

246
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,136
BUT I SLEPT FUNNY AND MY HAIR WAS...

247
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,137
NOT YOU.

248
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,338
RELAX.

249
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,143
EVER HAVE TO FIRE ANYONE?

250
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,145
NO, BUT THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM, SIR.

251
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,547
THAT'S WHY MY NAME'S ON THE DOOR.

252
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,348
BY THE WAY, DO YOU KNOW

253
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,950
WHEN I'M GETTING MY NAME ON THE DOOR?

254
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,153
I DON'T KNOW.

255
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:55,755
I I PUT IT IN THE THING.

256
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,555
IT'S OKAY.

257
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,157
SO, UH...

258
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,759
WHO'S IT GOING TO BE?

259
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,861
NINA?

260
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,063
NINA...

261
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,467
NINA...

262
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,270
NINA...

263
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,371
ARE YOU OKAY?

264
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:16,275
YES. YES, I AM.

265
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:21,080
LISTEN, THE REASON I CALLED YOU IN HERE TODAY WAS, UH...

266
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,883
PLEASE DON'T HATE ME.

267
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,284
WHAT?

268
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,689
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE DINNER SOMETIME?

269
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,897
SO, PHEEBS, WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY?

270
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:42,301
WELL, WHAT I REALLY WANT IS FOR MY MOM TO BE ALIVE

271
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:45,104
AND ENJOY IT WITH ME, BUT...

272
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:45,905
OKAY...

273
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,307
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY:

274
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,110
ANYTHING FROM CRABTREE & EVELYN?

275
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,912
OOH! BATH SALTS

276
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:53,713
WOULD BE NICE.

277
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,715
OH, OKAY. GOOD.

278
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,222
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

279
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,224
YOU'RE COLD, I HAVE TO PEE

280
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,427
AND THERE'S A CUP OF COFFEE ON THE WINDOW.

281
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,628
HOW BAD COULD IT BE?

282
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:10,830
I THINK WE HAVE

283
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,932
AN ANSWER.

284
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,134
WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE?

285
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,738
THIS COULD BE GOD'S WAY OF TELLING US TO EAT AT HOME.

286
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,740
YOU THINK SHE GOT FIRED AT RIFF'S?

287
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,742
NO. WE WERE THERE LAST NIGHT.

288
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,343
SHE KEPT... BRINGING SWORDFISH.

289
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,345
ARE YOU GOING TO GO TO..?

290
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,947
I'LL WAIT UNTIL AFTER WE ORDER.

291
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,148
IT'S HER, RIGHT?

292
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,750
IT LOOKS LIKE... HER.

293
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,351
UM... EXCUSE ME?

294
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,953
YEAH?

295
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,755
HI! IT'S US.

296
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:43,062
RIGHT. AND IT'S ME.

297
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,464
SO YOU'RE HERE TOO.

298
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,566
AS MUCH AS YOU ARE.

299
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,168
YOUR TURN?

300
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,369
UH... WE KNOW

301
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,570
WHAT WE WANT.

302
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,172
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

303
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,974
ALL WE WANT IS TWO CAFFE LATTES.

304
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,976
AND SOME BISCOTTI COOKIES.

305
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,778
GOOD CHOICE.

306
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,582
IT'S DEFINITELY HER.

307
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,284
YEAH.

308
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,688
Buenos noches, John-Boy.

309
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,991
Buenos noches, Jim-Bob.

310
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,093
YOU STILL HAVEN'T TOLD THAT GIRL

311
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,095
SHE DOESN'T HAVE A JOB?

312
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,898
WELL, YOU STILL HAVEN'T TAKEN DOWN

313
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,900
THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.

314
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,101
CONGRATULATIONS.

315
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:25,704
I THINK YOU'VE FOUND THE WORLD'S THINNEST ARGUMENT.

316
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,908
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT MOMENT.

317
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:32,511
THAT SHOULDN'T BE SO HARD NOW THAT YOU'RE DATING.

318
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,314
SWEETHEART, YOU'RE FIRED, BUT HOW ABOUT A QUICKIE

319
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,316
BEFORE I GO TO WORK?

320
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,120
HEY.

321
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,321
HEY. HEY.

322
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,522

323
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,124
ONCE YOU'RE INSIDE

324
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,126
YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOCK ANYMORE.

325
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,130
I'LL GET IT.

326
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,335
OH. HI, MR. HECKLES.

327
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,636
YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN.

328
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,838
DOING WHAT?

329
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,439
WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING.

330
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,842
WE'RE JUST SITTING AROUND TALKING. QUIETLY.

331
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,345
I CAN HEAR YOU THROUGH THE CEILING.

332
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:10,349
MY CATS CAN'T SLEEP.

333
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,651
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE CATS.

334
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,854
I COULD HAVE CATS.

335
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,356
GOOD BYE, MR. HECKLES.

336
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,358
WE'LL TRY TO KEEP IT DOWN.

337
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,764
PHOEBE, COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

338
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,366
WOULD YOU TRY THIS ON?

339
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,368
I WANT TO MAKE SURE IT FITS.

340
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,370
OH, MY FIRST BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

341
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,972
OH, THIS IS REALLY...

342
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,173
OH, NO, NO, NO.

343
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,174
IT'S FOR URSULA.

344
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,775
I JUST FIGURED SIZE WISE...

345
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,180
OH. SURE. YEAH.

346
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,781
OKAY. FITS.

347
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,385
ARE YOU SEEING HER AGAIN?

348
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,687
YEP. ICE CAPADES.

349
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,289
THIS IS SERIOUS.

350
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,691
I'VE NEVER KNOWN YOU TO PAY MONEY

351
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,493
FOR ANY KIND OF CAPADE.

352
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,095
I DON'T KNOW.

353
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,696
I LIKE HER, YOU KNOW?

354
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:58,497
SHE'S DIFFERENT.

355
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,698
THERE'S, UH...

356
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,300
SOMETHING ABOUT HER...

357
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,801
THAT YOU LIKE.

358
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,003
WE GET IT.

359
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,304
YOU LIKE HER-- GREAT.

360
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,505
PHOEBE, I ASKED YOU

361
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,307
AND YOU SAID IT WAS OKAY.

362
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,709
MAYBE NOW IT'S NOT OKAY.

363
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:15,314
OKAY. WELL, MAYBE NOW I'M NOT OKAY WITH IT NOT BEING OKAY.

364
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,916
OKAY.

365
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,522
KNIT, GOOD WOMAN, KNIT! KNIT!

366
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,735

367
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:40,439
AND THAT'S THE CHRYSLER BUILDING RIGHT THERE.

368
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,140
NINA.

369
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,442
MR. DOUGLAS.

370
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,643
COOL TIE.

371
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,348
SHE'S STILL HERE.

372
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,749
YES. YES, SHE IS.

373
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,751
DIDN'T I MEMO YOU ON THIS?

374
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,753
AFTER I LET HER GO

375
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,957
UH, I GOT A CALL FROM HER PSYCHIATRIST

376
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,759
DR. FLANE... DR. FLENNEN, DR. FLEN

377
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,861
AND, UH...

378
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:06,265
HE INFORMED ME THAT, UH, SHE TOOK THE NEWS RATHER BADLY.

379
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,468
IN FACT, HE MENTIONED THE WORD "FRENZY."

380
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,469
Y YOU'RE KIDDING.

381
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,670
SHE SEEMED SO...

382
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,771
OH, NO, NO. NINA?

383
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,174
SHE IS WHOO WHOO WHOO- WHOO WHOO WHOO!

384
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,576
IN FACT, IF YOU ASKED HER RIGHT NOW

385
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,779
SHE WOULD HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF BEING FIRED AT ALL.

386
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,382
THAT'S... UNBELIEVABLE.

387
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,384
AND YET BELIEVABLE.

388
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,286
SO I'VE DECIDED NOT TO FIRE HER AGAIN

389
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:30,489
UNTIL I CAN BE ASSURED THAT SHE WILL BE NO THREAT

390
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,690
TO HERSELF OR OTHERS.

391
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,791
I SEE. HMM.

392
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,393
I GUESS YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW

393
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,795
WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE A PERSON'S HEAD.

394
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:41,600
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT PSYCHOLOGY, SIR.

395
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,105
 The sound Mom and Dad will never forget.

396
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:49,708
For this, after all, is the miracle of birth.

397
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,110
LIGHTS, PLEASE.

398
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,512
AND THAT'S HAVING A BABY.

399
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,514
NEXT WEEK IS OUR FINAL CLASS.

400
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,317
SUSAN, GO DEEP.

401
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,225
 IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

402
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,627
IT'S JUST, JUST IMPOSSIBLE.

403
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:09,828
WHAT IS, HONEY?

404
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,231
WHAT THAT WOMAN... DID.

405
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,432
I AM NOT DOING THAT.

406
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:17,036
IT'S JUST GOING TO HAVE TO STAY IN, THAT'S ALL.

407
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,038
EVERYTHING'LL BE THE SAME.

408
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,639
IT'LL JUST STAY IN.

409
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,442
SHH. EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

410
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,044
OH, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?!

411
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,046
NO ONE'S GOING UP TO YOU AND SAYING

412
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,647
"HI. IS THAT YOUR NOSTRIL?

413
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,050
MIND IF WE PUSH THIS POT ROAST THROUGH IT?!"

414
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,852
CAROL, CAROL, SWEETIE.

415
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,454
CLEANSING BREATH.

416
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,856
I KNOW IT'S FRIGHTENING

417
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:42,661
BUT, BIG PICTURE-- THE BIRTH PART IS JUST ONE DAY

418
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:45,464
AND WHEN IT'S OVER, WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE PARENTS

419
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,066
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

420
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,969
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

421
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,171
RIGHT? ROSS?

422
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,872
ROSS?

423
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:56,475
I'M GOING TO BE A FATHER.

424
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,178
THIS IS JUST OCCURRING TO YOU?

425
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,380
I ALWAYS KNEW I WAS HAVING A BABY.

426
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,583
I JUST NEVER REALIZED THE BABY WAS HAVING ME.

427
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,585
OH, YOU'RE GOING TO BE GREAT.

428
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,187
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

429
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:11,790
I CAN'T EVEN GET MARCEL TO STOP EATING THE BATH MAT.

430
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,792
HOW AM I GOING TO RAISE A KID?

431
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,195
SOME SCIENTISTS ARE NOW SAYING

432
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,997
THAT MONKEYS AND BABIES ARE ACTUALLY DIFFERENT.

433
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,003
YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK INTO IT.

434
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,706
 WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

435
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:28,907
OUT.

436
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:29,508
WITH?

437
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,311
YES.

438
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,114
CAN I JUST ASK YOU ONE QUESTION?

439
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,717
HAVE YOU TWO, YOU KNOW... LIKE, YOU KNOW?

440
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,321
YOU KNOW.

441
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,922
YET?

442
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:46,425
NOT THAT IT'S ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS

443
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,427
BUT NO, WE HAVEN'T. OKAY?

444
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,234
YOU MEANT SEX, RIGHT?

445
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,248
DO YOU HAVE A SEC?

446
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,250
UH, SURE, NINA. WHAT'S UP?

447
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,154
FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AVOIDING ME

448
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,156
AND GIVING ME REALLY STRANGE LOOKS.

449
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:22,361
OH, WELL, UH, MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE, UH...

450
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,562
JEALOUS OF US.

451
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,664
MAYBE. BUT THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN

452
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,666
WHY THEY KEEP TAKING MY SCISSORS.

453
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,169
UH, WELL, MAYBE THAT'S, UH

454
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,372
BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING A BIG RAISE.

455
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,474
I AM?

456
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,075
SURE. WHY NOT?

457
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,477
OH, MY GOD!

458
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,078
YOU'RE AMAZING!

459
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,581
OH, YOU DON'T KNOW.

460
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,484
HELEN, MAKE SURE WE PUT THROUGH THE PAPER WORK

461
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,085
ON MS. BOOKBINDER'S RAISE.

462
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,388
You still want me to send her psychological profile

463
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,589
to Personnel?

464
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,191
WHAT?

465
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,493
HELEN DRINKS.

466
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,094
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

467
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:07,706
SO, AFTER THE PROPOSAL, I KIND OF UNRAVELED.

468
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:11,510
RIGHT, BECAUSE YOU WERE REALLY IN CONTROL UP UNTIL THEN.

469
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,314
I ENDED UP TELLING HER EVERYTHING.

470
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,515
HOW'D SHE TAKE IT?

471
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,518
PRETTY WELL, EXCEPT FOR THE STAPLER THING.

472
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:23,121
A LITTLE TIP: IF YOU'RE EVER IN A SIMILAR SITUATION

473
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:26,725
NEVER EVER LEAVE YOUR HAND ON THE DESK.

474
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,929
OKAY, I THINK I GET HOW TO DO THIS.

475
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:35,234

476
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,835
ALL RIGHT, SO CAN WE TURN THIS OFF

477
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,437
AND MAKE THEM GO AWAY?

478
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,038
I CAN'T WATCH THIS.

479
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,341
OKAY, PHEEBS, THEY'RE GONE.

480
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,642
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

481
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,644
YEAH. IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW

482
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,847
IT'S THIS WHOLE STUPID URSULA THING.

483
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,850
CAN I ASK? SO HE'S GOING OUT WITH HER.

484
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,852
IS IT REALLY SO TERRIBLE?

485
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,554
UM, YEAH.

486
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:00,359
I'M NOT SAYING SHE'S, LIKE, EVIL, OR ANYTHING.

487
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,562
SHE JUST, YOU KNOW... SHE'S ALWAYS BREAKING MY STUFF.

488
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,864
WHEN I WAS EIGHT, AND I WOULDN'T LET HER

489
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:09,268
HAVE MY JUDY JETSON THERMOS, SO SHE THREW IT

490
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,669
UNDER THE BUS.

491
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,872
AND THEN WHEN I WAS 12, AND SHE BROKE MY COLLARBONE.

492
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,874
ALL RIGHT, I MEAN, SHE DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT

493
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,876
BUT I THINK IT STILL COUNTS.

494
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,580
OH, AND THEN THERE'S RANDY BROWN

495
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,383
WHO WAS LIKE... HAVE YOU EVER HAD A BOYFRIEND

496
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,385
WHO WAS, LIKE, YOUR BEST FRIEND?

497
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,488
NO. NO.

498
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,890
WELL, BUT THAT'S WHAT HE WAS FOR ME

499
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,093
AND SHE, YOU KNOW, KIND OF STOLE HIM AWAY

500
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,695
AND THEN BROKE HIS HEART

501
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:40,299
AND THEN HE WOULDN'T EVEN TALK TO ME ANYMORE

502
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,902
BECAUSE HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE AROUND ANYTHING

503
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,305
THAT LOOKED LIKE EITHER ONE OF US.

504
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,008
OH, PHEEBS...

505
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,811
I MEAN, I KNOW JOEY IS NOT MY BOYFRIEND

506
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,012
OR MY THERMOS...

507
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,014
YOU KNOW, OR ANYTHING, BUT...

508
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,215
HEY, YOU'RE NOT

509
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,817
GOING TO LOSE HIM.

510
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,218
YOU'VE GOT TO TALK TO JOEY.

511
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:01,820
YEAH.

512
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,422
HE DOESN'T KNOW THIS STUFF.

513
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,424
IF HE KNEW HOW YOU FELT...

514
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,225
HE'S FALLING IN LOVE WITH HER.

515
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,427
OH, PLEASE.

516
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,429
THEY'VE BEEN GOING OUT A WEEK.

517
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,431
THEY HAVEN'T EVEN SLEPT TOGETHER YET.

518
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,433
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT SERIOUS.

519
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:19,538
OKAY. OKAY.

520
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,341
OKAY. OH...

521
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,157
OH!

522
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,959
YEAH, UM...

523
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,761
MAY WE HELP YOU?

524
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,170
RACHEL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

525
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,372
IT'S FREEZING OUT HERE.

526
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,573
WOULD YOU COME BACK INSIDE?

527
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,575
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

528
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,176
YOU WANTED ME TO TAKE THEM DOWN

529
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:01,780
SO I'M TAKING THEM DOWN, OKAY?

530
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,382
WHOA. WHOA!

531
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,384
RACHEL!

532
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,785
RACHEL!

533
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:09,688
I'M OKAY! I'M OKAY!

534
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,690
MR. HECKLES?

535
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,694
MR. HECKLES, COULD YOU HELP ME, PLEASE?

536
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,196
SEE, THIS IS JUST THE KIND OF THING

537
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:19,798
I WAS TALKING ABOUT.    538 00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,603
OW, OW, OW. OW, OW, OW.

539
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,505
OW, OW, OW.

540
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,106
OW, OW, OW.

541
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,708
HI. MY FRIEND HERE WAS TAKING DOWN

542
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,511
OUR CHRISTMAS LIGHTS AND SHE FELL OFF THE BALCONY

543
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,513
AND MAY HAVE BROKEN HER FOOT OR ANKLE OR SOMETHING.

544
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:37,315
MY GOD, YOU STILL HAVE YOUR CHRISTMAS LIGHTS UP?!

545
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,718
FILL THIS OUT

546
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,720
AND BRING IT BACK TO ME.

547
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,924
OW, OW, OW. OW, OW, OW.

548
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,926
OKAY.

549
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,328
OOH. ALL RIGHT.

550
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,930
NAME.

551
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,131
ADDRESS.

552
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,133
OKAY, ARE YOU CURRENTLY ON ANY MEDICATION?

553
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,334
NO.

554
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,135
OH, WAIT!

555
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,538
WAIT, YES. BLISTEX.

556
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,741
UH,NO.

557
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,143
OKAY. IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, CALL..?

558
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:06,344
