00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,802
EVERYBODY? SHH, SHH.

2
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:04,704
CENTRAL PERK IS PROUD TO PRESENT

3
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:09,109
THE MUSIC OF MISS PHOEBE BUFFAY!

4
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:16,416
HI. I WANT TO START WITH A SONG THAT'S ABOUT THAT MOMENT

5
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:20,420
WHEN YOU SUDDENLY REALIZE WHAT LIFE IS REALLY ALL ABOUT.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,322
OKAY. HERE WE GO.

7
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,027
OKAY.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,429
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

9
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,535
WHAT THE..?

10
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,742
OH, GREAT.

11
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,344
THIS IS JUST...

12
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,255

25
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,701
WOW, THIS IS SO COOL.

26
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,303
THE ENTIRE CITY

27
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:44,204
IS BLACKED OUT.

28
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,206
MOM SAYS IT'S ALL OF MANHATTAN

29
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:49,008
PARTS OF BROOKLYN AND QUEENS, AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA

30
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,110
WHEN IT'S COMING BACK ON.

31
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,311
GUYS, THIS IS BIG.

32
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,413
PANTS AND A SWEATER? WHY, MOM?

33
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,815
WHO AM I GOING TO MEET IN A BLACKOUT

34
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:59,619
POWER COMPANY GUYS? ELIGIBLE LOOTERS?

35
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,621
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS LATER?

36
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,623
OKAY.

37
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,225
CAN I BORROW THE PHONE?

38
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,227
I WANT TO CALL MY APARTMENT

39
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,229
AND CHECK ON MY GRANDMA.

40
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,430
WHAT'S MY NUMBER?

41
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,033
WELL, I NEVER CALL ME.

42
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,337
OH, MY GOD. IT'S HER.

43
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,539
IT'S THAT VICTORIA'S SECRET MODEL--

44
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,141
SOMETHING "GOODACRE."

45
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,542
HI, MOM. IT'S JILL.

46
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,345
SHE'S RIGHT. IT'S JILL.

47
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,647
OH, MY GOD.

48
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,049
I AM TRAPPED IN AN A.T.M. VESTIBULE

49
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,651
WITH JILL GOODACRE.

50
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,453
IS IT A VESTIBULE?

51
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,855
MAYBE IT'S AN ATRIUM.

52
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:40,660
YEAH. THAT IS THE PART TO FOCUS ON, YOU IDIOT.

53
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,162
YEAH, I'M FINE.

54
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,964
I'M STUCK AT THE BANK IN AN A.T.M. VESTIBULE.

55
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,567
JILL SAYS "VESTIBULE."

56
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,370
I'M GOING WITH "VESTIBULE."

57
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,571
I'M FINE.

58
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:52,972
NO, I'M NOT ALONE.

59
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,574
I DON'T KNOW.

60
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,775
SOME GUY.

61
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,677
OH! "SOME GUY."

62
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,679
I AM "SOME GUY."

63
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,283
"HEY, JILL, I SAW YOU WITH SOME GUY LAST NIGHT.

64
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,085
YES. HE WAS SOME GUY."

65
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,296
HEY, EVERYONE.

66
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:26,306

00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,312
WELL, CHANDLER'S OLD ROOMMATE WAS JEWISH

00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,316
SO, HAPPY HANUKKAH, EVERYONE.

00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,033
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

78
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,635
IT'S BEEN 14 MINUTES

79
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,838
AND YOU STILL HAVE NOT SAID ONE WORD.

80
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,840
OH, GOD. DO SOMETHING.

81
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,243
JUST MAKE CONTACT. SMILE.

82
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,047
THERE YOU GO.

83
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,453
YOU'RE DEFINITELY SCARING HER.

84
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,455

85
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,857
HELLO?

WELL, THE BLACKOUT'S SCARING HIM.

00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,872
WELL, YOU'D PEE IN DAD'S SHOES, TOO, IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW

92
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,774

00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,376
ALL RIGHT. CALL ME BACK.

94
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:38,978

00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,084
THAT WASN'T SO HARD-- "MOTHERS."

99
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,686
YEAH, MOTHERS.

100
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:47,487
YEAH.

101
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,691
DON'T SMILE.

102
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,194
UH, WOULD YOU LIKE TO CALL SOMEBODY?

103
00:04:55,194 --> 00:05:00,400
YEAH. ABOUT 300 GUYS I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH.

104
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,005
THANKS.

105
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,609

00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,810
HELLO.

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,911
HEY, IT'S ME.

IT'S CHANDLER.

00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,414
ARE YOU OKAY?

110
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,115
YEAH, I'M FINE.

111
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:21,921
I'M TRAPPED IN AN A.T.M. VESTIBULE

116
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,136
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU SAID.

117
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,539
OH, PUT JOEY ON THE PHONE.

118
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,743
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

119
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,945
I'M TRAPPED...

120
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:49,148
IN AN A.T.M. VESTIBULE

121
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:52,752
WITH JILL GOODACRE.

122
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:53,953
OH, MY GOD!

123
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,957
HE'S TRAPPED IN AN A.T.M. VESTIBULE

124
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,659
WITH JILL GOODACRE!

125
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,860
CHANDLER, LISTEN, LISTEN!

126
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,764

127
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,967
YEAH, LIKE THAT THOUGHT NEVER ENTERED MY MIND.

128
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,672
 OKAY, SOMEBODY, SOMEBODY.

129
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,475
I'LL GO, I'LL GO.

130
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,678
SENIOR YEAR OF COLLEGE ON A POOL TABLE.

131
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,480
POOL TABLE! OOH HOO!

132
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,282
THAT'S MY SISTER.

133
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,484
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

134
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,886
MY WEIRDEST PLACE WOULD HAVE TO BE...

135
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,689
THE WOMEN'S ROOM ON THE SECOND FLOOR

136
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,091
OF THE NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC LIBRARY.

137
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,192
OH, MY GOD.

138
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,194
WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN A LIBRARY?

139
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,098
HEY, PHEEBS, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

140
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,901
OH, UM, MILWAUKEE.

141
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,008
IT'S A REALLY WEIRD PLACE.

142
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,911
UH, ROSS?

143
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,313
DISNEYLAND, 1989

144
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,716
"IT'S A SMALL WORLD AFTER ALL."

145
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,119
NO WAY.

146
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,121
YEAH, THE RIDE BROKE DOWN

147
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,723
SO CAROL AND I WENT

148
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,125
BEHIND A COUPLE OF THOSE MECHANICAL

149
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,326
DUTCH CHILDREN.

150
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,928
THEY FIXED THE RIDE

151
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,330
AND WE WERE ASKED NEVER TO RETURN

152
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,832
TO THE MAGIC KINGDOM.

153
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,736
SO, UH, LET'S SEE  THAT WOULD LEAVE...

154
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:17,937
OOH, RACHEL?

155
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,839
COME ON, I ALREADY WENT.

156
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,940
YOU DID NOT.

157
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,941
YES, I DID.

158
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,543
COME ON.

159
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,144
ALL RIGHT, UH...

160
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:29,148
THE WEIRDEST PLACE WOULD HAVE TO BE

161
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:32,351
OH... THE FOOT OF THE BED.

162
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:35,555
STEP BACK.

163
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,557
WE HAVE A WINNER.

164
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:50,870
HEY, YOU KNOW, THIS MUST BE WHAT THE FRIDGE LOOKS LIKE WITH THE DOOR CLOSED.

165
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,872
SPOOKY.

166
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:54,774
ANYBODY HUNGRY?

167
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,977
WE'VE GOT A KLONDIKE... SOUP.

168
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,979
I'VE NEVER HAD A RELATIONSHIP

169
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,981
WITH THAT KIND OF PASSION

170
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:06,385
WHERE YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDDLE

171
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:07,887
OF A THEME PARK.

172
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:11,090
WELL, IT WAS THE ONLY THING TO DO THERE

173
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,092
THAT DIDN'T HAVE A LINE.

174
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,796
WELL, SEE? BARRY WOULDN'T EVEN KISS ME

175
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,798
ON A MINIATURE GOLF COURSE.

176
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:19,398
COME ON.

177
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:20,900
NO.

178
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,803
HE SAID WE WERE HOLDING UP THE PEOPLE BEHIND US.

179
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,805
AND YOU DIDN'T MARRY HIM BECAUSE...

180
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:31,711
DO YOU THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT GO THROUGH LIFE

181
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,113
NEVER HAVING THAT KIND OF..?

182
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,014
PROBABLY.

183
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:35,915
REALLY?

184
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,617
BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING

185
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,218
PASSION IS WAY OVERRATED.

186
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,220
YEAH, RIGHT.

187
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,123
IT IS. EVENTUALLY, IT KIND OF BURNS OUT

188
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,324
BUT, HOPEFULLY

189
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:49,128
WHAT YOU'RE LEFT WITH IS TRUST AND SECURITY

190
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,330
AND, WELL, IN THE CASE

191
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,933
OF MY EX WIFE, LESBIANISM.

192
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:59,939
SO FOR ALL THOSE WHO MISS OUT ON THAT PASSION THING

193
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,742
THERE'S ALL THAT OTHER GOOD STUFF.

194
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,344
OKAY.

195
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,147
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE YOU.

196
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,448
YOU DON'T?

197
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:10,850
HMM.

198
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,854
SEE, I SEE, UH... BIG PASSION IN YOUR FUTURE.

199
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:15,955
REALLY?

200
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:16,556
MM HMM.

201
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,157
YOU DO? I DO.

202
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,459
OH, ROSS, YOU'RE SO GREAT.

203
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,472
IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.

204
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,480
WHAT?

205
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:42,582
YOU AND RACHEL.

206
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,990
WHA... ME AND RA... WHA..?

207
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,992
WHY NOT?

208
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:57,396
BECAUSE YOU WAITED TOO LONG TO MAKE YOUR MOVE

209
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:01,000
AND NOW YOU'RE IN "THE FRIEND ZONE."

210
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,803
NO, NO, NO, I'M NOT IN THE ZONE.

211
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,205
NO. ROSS, YOU'RE MAYOR OF THE ZONE.

212
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,009
LOOK, I'M TAKING MY TIME, ALL RIGHT?

213
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,611
I'M LAYING THE GROUNDWORK.

214
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,615
YEAH, EVERY DAY, I GET JUST A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO...

215
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:16,916
PRIESTHOOD.

216
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,219
ROSS, I'M TELLING YOU

217
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,221
SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

218
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,823
OH, YEAH?

219
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,626
SHE JUST RAN HER FINGERS THROUGH MY HAIR.

220
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,028
WERE YOU MISSING THAT INTERACTION?

221
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,630
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

222
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,833
THIS IS RUNNING FINGERS  THROUGH YOUR HAIR, OKAY?

223
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,835
NOW, THIS...

224
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,436
IS A TOUSLE.

225
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,040
LOOK, ROSS, IF YOU DON'T ASK HER OUT SOON

226
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,843
YOU'LL END UP STUCK IN THE ZONE FOREVER.

227
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:44,644
I WILL, I WILL.

228
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,847
I'M JUST... SEE, I'M WAITING FOR THE, UH...

229
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,048
THE RIGHT MOMENT.

230
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,249

231
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,851
WHAT?

232
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,052
WHAT? NOW?

233
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,054
DUH..!

234
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,656
WHAT'S MESSING YOU UP?

235
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,859
THE WINE, THE CANDLES, THE MOONLIGHT, HUH?

236
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,062
JUST GO UP TO HER AND SAY, "LOOK, RACHEL..."

237
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,263
SHH SHH SHH!

238
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,464
SHH SHH SHH!

239
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,267
WHAT ARE WE SHUSHING?

240
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:11,871
WE'RE SHUSHING BECAUSE... WE'RE TRYING TO HEAR SOMETHING.

241
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,072
WHAT?

242
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:13,873
SHH.

243
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,875
DON'T YOU HEAR THAT?

244
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,680
AHH!

245
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,281
SEE?

246
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,987
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME GUM?

247
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,588
OH, IS IT SUGARLESS?

248
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,192
NO. SORRY, IT'S NOT.

249
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,293
THEN, NO THANKS.

250
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,895
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

251
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:42,601
MENTAL NOTE: IF JILL GOODACRE OFFERS YOU GUM, YOU TAKE IT.

252
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:47,006
IF SHE OFFERS YOU MANGLED ANIMAL CARCASS, YOU TAKE IT.

253
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,611
 ? NEW YORK CITY HAS NO POWER ?

254
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:56,215
? AND THE MILK IS GETTING SOUR ?

255
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:00,219
? BUT TO ME IT IS NOT SCARY ?

256
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:04,223
? BECAUSE I STAY AWAY FROM DAIRY... ?

257
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,928
? LA LA LA LA LA LA LA... ?

258
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,533
OKAY, HERE GOES.

259
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:15,735
YOU GONNA DO IT?

260
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:16,335
WANT ME TO HELP?

261
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,937
YOU COME OUT THERE

262
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,138
YOU'RE A DEAD MAN.

263
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,140
ROSS...

264
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,742
GOOD LUCK, MAN.

265
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,343
THANKS.

266
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:28,748
OKAY.

267
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,548
OKAY.

268
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:34,854
WHERE YOU GOING?

269
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:35,654
OUTSIDE.

270
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:36,856
YOU CAN'T GO OUT THERE.

271
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,457
WHY NOT?

272
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,760
BECAUSE OF, UH... THE REASON.

273
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,963
AND THAT WOULD BE?

274
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,565
I, UH... I CAN'T TELL YOU.

275
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:47,767
JOEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

276
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,069
OKAY, LISTEN, YOU GOT TO PROMISE

277
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,672
YOU'LL NEVER, EVER TELL ROSS THAT I TOLD YOU.

278
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:54,874
ABOUT WHAT?

279
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,475
HE'S PLANNING YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY.

280
00:12:56,475 --> 00:13:00,079
OH, MY GOD, I LOVE HIM.

281
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,680
AND YOU BETTER ACT SURPRISED.

282
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:02,882
ABOUT WHAT?

283
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,383
MY SURPRISE PARTY.

284
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,885
WHAT SURPRISE PARTY?

285
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,086
OH, STOP IT.

286
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,687
JOEY ALREADY TOLD ME.

287
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,689
WELL, HE DIDN'T TELL ME.

288
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,591
HEY, DON'T LOOK AT ME.

289
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,193
THIS IS ROSS'S THING.

290
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,795
THIS IS SO TYPICAL.

291
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,797
I'M THE LAST ONE TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

292
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,099
YOU ARE NOT. WE TELL YOU STUFF.

293
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,501
YUH HUH. I WAS THE LAST TO KNOW

294
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,704
WHEN CHANDLER GOT BIT BY THE PEACOCK AT THE ZOO.

295
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,507
LAST TO KNOW YOU HAD A CRUSH ON JOEY

296
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,109
WHEN HE WAS MOVING IN.

297
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,310
WHAT?

298
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,513
OH, LOOKS LIKE I WAS SECOND TO LAST.

299
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,020
YOU, UH... YOU HAD A CRUSH ON ME?

300
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,022
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, IT WASN'T A CRUSH.

301
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,024
IT WAS A...

302
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,625
A DENT.

303
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,127
BIG DENT?

304
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,728
OH... ALL RIGHT, LOOK

305
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,730
YOU WERE MOVING YOUR FURNITURE UPSTAIRS.

306
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,732
I THOUGHT YOU HAD... NICE ARMS.

307
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:54,533
THAT'S ALL.

308
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,537
NICE ARMS, HUH?

309
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,139
HEY, MON...

310
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,341
I'M MOVING THE CHAIR.

311
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,145
DO ANYTHING FOR YOU?

312
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,249
YOU KNOW, WITH ALL THE LIGHTS OUT

313
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,251
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE STARS.

314
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,853
MM. IT'S SO NICE.

315
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,054
MM.

316
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:21,460
HEY, I HAVE A QUESTION.

317
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,464
WELL, ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT SO MUCH A QUESTION

318
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,468
AS MORE OF A GENERAL WONDERING... MENT.

319
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:31,971
OKAY.

320
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,172
OKAY.

321
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,773
UH, HERE GOES.

322
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:42,381
UM, WELL, FOR A WHILE NOW, I'VE BEEN WANTING TO, UM...

323
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,482

WHAT?

328
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,389

329
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,192
? ...TOP OF THE WORLD LOOKIN' ?

330
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,194
? DOWN ON CREATION ?

331
00:14:55,194 --> 00:15:00,799
? AND THE ONLY EXPLANATION I CAN FIND ?

332
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,602
? IS THE LOVE THAT I'VE FOUND ?

333
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:06,405
? EVER SINCE YOU'VE BEEN AROUND ?

334
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:12,411
? YOU JUST PUT ME AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD ?

335
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:16,015
? TOP OF THE WORLD LOOKIN' ?

336
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,817
? DOWN ON CREATION AND THE ONLY... ?

337
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,322
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS JUST BACTINE.

338
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,523
IT WON'T HURT.

339
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,626
OW, OW.

340
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,029
SORRY. THAT WAS WAX.

341
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,031
THIS POOR LITTLE TOOTY

342
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,632
IS SCARED TO DEATH.

343
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,634
WE SHOULD FIND HIS OWNER.

344
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,137
LET'S PUT THE POOR LITTLE TOOTY IN THE HALL.

345
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,539
DURING A BLACKOUT?

346
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,141
SHE'LL GET TRAMPLED.

347
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,742
YEAH..?

348
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,546
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT-- DAMAGE CONTROL.

349
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,747
GET BACK TO THE GUM.

350
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,150
ON SECOND THOUGHT, GUM WOULD BE PERFECTION.

351
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,955
"GUM WOULD BE PERFECTION"?

352
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,756
"GUM WOULD BE PERFECTION."

353
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,960
COULD HAVE SAID, "GUM WOULD BE NICE."

354
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,762
COULD HAVE SAID, "I'LL HAVE A STICK."

355
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:07,366
BUT NO, NO, NO, NO, FOR ME GUM IS PERFECTION.

356
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,368
I LOATHE MYSELF.

357
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,972
OH, NO. THE MELLMANS.

358
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,974
THEY HATE ALL LIVING THINGS.

359
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,976

360
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,782
HI. WE JUST FOUND THIS CAT.

UM, YEAH, IT'S, UH, IT'S MINE.

363
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,189
IT SEEMS TO HATE YOU.

364
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,191
ARE YOU SURE?

365
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,993
YEAH. GIVE ME MY CAT.

366
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,594

HI.

383
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,333

384
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,735
OH, WOW.

385
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,544
HEY, MON, WANT TO GO FOR A RIDE IN MY RACE CAR?

386
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,347
I'LL BRING MY ARMS.

387
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,748
THAT'D BE NICE.

388
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,750
THEN WE CAN BRING MY WHEELBARROW

389
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,153
TO CARRY YOUR TEETH.

390
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,155
COME ON, LUCKY SIXES.

391
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,657
EVERYBODY?

392
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:39,858
THIS IS PAOLO.

393
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,860
PAOLO, I WANT YOU

394
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,062
TO MEET MY FRIENDS.

395
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,663
THIS IS MONICA.

396
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:45,864
HI.

397
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,066
AND JOEY.

398
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:47,866
HI.

399
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,868
AND ROSS.

400
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,070
HI.

401
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,273

402
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,679
HE DOESN'T SPEAK MUCH ENGLISH.

403
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,082
MONOPOLY.

404
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,683

405
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,885
LOOK AT THAT.

406
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,288
SO, UH...

407
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,290
WHERE DID, UH, PAOLO COME FROM?

408
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,093
UH, ITALY, I THINK.

409
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,095
NO, I MEAN TONIGHT, IN THE BUILDING...

410
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,097
SUDDENLY INTO OUR LIVES.

411
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,698
WELL, THAT CAT.

412
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,101
THE CAT TURNED OUT TO BE PAOLO'S CAT.

413
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,702
ISN'T THAT FUNNY?

414
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:24,903
HA!

415
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,905
THAT THAT IS FUNNY

416
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,308
AND RACHEL KEEPS TOUCHING HIM.

417
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,112
I LOOKED ALL OVER THE BUILDING

418
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,514
AND I COULDN'T FIND THE KITTY ANYWHERE.

419
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:36,615
I FOUND HIM.

420
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,217
IT WAS PAOLO'S CAT.

421
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,620
AH, WELL, THERE YOU GO-- LAST TO KNOW AGAIN.

422
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,823
AND I'M GUESSING SINCE NOBODY TOLD ME

423
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,024
THIS IS PAOLO.

424
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,626
OH, PAOLO.

425
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,228
THIS IS PHOEBE.

426
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,028
HI.

427
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,630

428
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,034
YOU BETCHA.

429
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,440
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

430
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,041
WHAT NEXT?

431
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,243
BLOW A BUBBLE.

432
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,444
A BUBBLE'S GOOD.

433
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,446
IT'S GOT A BOYISH CHARM.

434
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:08,647
IT'S IMPISH.

435
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,249
HERE WE GO.

436
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,762
NICE GOING, IMP.

437
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,364
OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

438
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,366
ALL I NEED TO DO IS

439
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,569
REACH OVER AND PUT IT BACK

440
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,571
IN MY MOUTH.

441
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:34,973
GOOD SAVE.

442
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:38,177
WE'RE BACK ON TRACK, AND I'M...

443
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,380
CHEWING SOMEONE ELSE'S GUM.

444
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,782
GOD! OH, THIS IS NOT MY GUM!

445
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,784
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!

446
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,786
AND NOW YOU'RE CHOKING.

447
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,790
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

448
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,794
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE CHOKING!

449
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,699

450
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,900
BETTER?

451
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,101
YES.

452
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,703
THANK YOU.

453
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,904
THAT WAS...

454
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,105
THAT WAS...

455
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,007
PERFECTION?

456
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,513

457
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,921
BLAH BLAH BLAH- BLAH BLAH.

458
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,324
BLAH BLAH BLAH- BLAH BLAH BLAH.

459
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,526
BL BL BL BL BLAH.

460
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:32,331
THAT WAS NO TOUSLE.

461
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,938
HEY, WHAT DID HE SAY THAT WAS SO FUNNY?

462
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,940
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA.

463
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,343
THAT'S, THAT'S CLASSIC.

464
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:47,045
MY GOD, YOU GUYS, WHAT AM I DOING?

465
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:48,247
THIS IS SO UN ME.

466
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,249
IF YOU WANT, I'LL DO IT.

467
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,952
I KNOW.

468
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,355
I JUST WANT TO BITE HIS BOTTOM LIP.

469
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,757
BUT I WON'T.

470
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,359
WHEN HE FIRST SMILED

471
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,361
THOSE THREE SECONDS WERE MORE EXCITING

472
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,564
THAN THREE WEEKS IN BERMUDA WITH BARRY.

473
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,165
DID YOU RENT MOPEDS?

474
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,968
BECAUSE I'VE HEARD...

475
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,572
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW. OKAY.

476
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:17,576
I KNOW IT'S TOTALLY SUPERFICIAL AND WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON

477
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,779
AND WE DON'T EVEN SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE

478
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,381
BUT, GOD!

479
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,687
PAOLO, HI.

480
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:29,888

KIND OF A THING.

486
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:45,604
THING?

487
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,906
THING. YES, THING.

488
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:50,409
YOU HAVE THE SEX.

489
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,610
NO.

490
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,612
NO, NO, UM...

491
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:56,415
TECHNICALLY THE, THE SEX IS NOT BEING HAD

492
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,016
BUT THAT'S, UH...

493
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,618
SEE, BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

494
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,020
SEE, UM, THE POINT IS, UH...

495
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,823

00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,231
NO.

500
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,433

501
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,435
NO, NOT WHERE I WAS GOING.

502
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,837
UH, IF YOU GET IN THE WAY...

503
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,839
WAY OF US BECOMING A THING

504
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:24,843
THEN, UH, I WOULD BE, WELL, VERY SAD.

505
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,845
OH, OH.

506
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,046

00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,652
OKAY.

00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,054
SO YOU, UH... YOU DO KNOW A LITTLE ENGLISH.

513
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,255
POCO. LITTLE.

514
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:40,058
DO YOU KNOW THE WORD "CRAPWEASEL"?

515
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,560
NO.

516
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,161
NO? THAT'S FUNNY

517
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,163
BECAUSE YOU ARE A HUGE CRAPWEASEL.

518
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,568
GRAZIE.

00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:52,070

OH, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,492
THE LAST CANDLE'S ABOUT TO BURN OUT.

528
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,594
TEN, NINE

529
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,996
EIGHT, SEVEN...

530
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,799

 THANK YOU.

00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:26,204
 THANKS.

535
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:30,208
 KIND OF SPOOKY WITHOUT ANY LIGHTS.

536
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:34,212
 MWAAAHH! HA HA HA!

537
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:37,015
 MWAAAHH! HA HA HA!

538
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,818

541
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:46,625

542
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,331
UH, ROSS

543
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,734
THIS PROBABLY ISN'T THE BEST TIME

544
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:56,935
TO BRING IT UP

545
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,338
BUT YOU HAVE TO THROW A PARTY FOR MONICA.

546
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,847
WELL, THIS HAS BEEN FUN.

547
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:12,150
YES, AND THANKS FOR LETTING ME USE YOUR PHONE

548
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,953

00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,156
WELL, GOOD BYE, CHANDLER.

550
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:20,158
I HAD A GREAT BLACKOUT.

551
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,361
SEE YA.

552
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,577

I'M ACCOUNT NUMBER 7143457

554
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:44,583
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GOT ANY OF THAT

555
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,786
BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE A COPY OF THE TAPE.
