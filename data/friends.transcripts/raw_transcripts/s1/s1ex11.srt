1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:04,804
 WHY?

2
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:06,806
I JUST WANT TO CHECK MY HOROSCOPE

3
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:08,008
TO SEE IF IT WAS RIGHT.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:08,808
 OH, MY GOD!

5
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,110
PHOEBE, DON'T LOOK NOW

6
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,112
BUT BEHIND YOU THERE IS A GUY

7
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:14,514
WHO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BREAK OUR HEARTS

8
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,916
AND PLUNGE US INTO A PIT OF DEPRESSION.

9
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:17,817
WHERE?

10
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,519
OOH, COME TO MAMA.

11
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,121
HE'S COMING. BE COOL.

12
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,922
BE COOL. BE COOL.

13
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:24,124
NICE HAT.

14
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:25,325
 THANKS.

15
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,727
WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING-- WHISTLE.

16
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:29,329
WE ARE NOT GOING TO WHISTLE.

17
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,430
YEAH, COME ON, DO IT! NO!

18
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,332
DO IT! DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!

19
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:33,333
WHOO HOO!

20
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,334

21
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:35,535

22
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,237

23
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,840
OH! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THAT!

37
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,288
 IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

38
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,290
NO, IT'S MINE.

39
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,292
WHY DID I "WHOO HOO"?

40
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,294
I MEAN, WHAT WAS I HOPING WOULD HAPPEN?

41
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,895
THAT HE'D TURN AROUND AND SAY

42
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,097
"OOH. I LOVE THAT SOUND.

43
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,099
I MUST HAVE YOU NOW."

44
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,700
I JUST WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING

45
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,702
WE COULD DO.

46
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,304
HELLO.

47
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:45,505
HELLO, COMA GUY.

48
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,309
GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!

49
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,810
PHOEBE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

50
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,113
MAYBE NOBODY'S TRIED THIS.

51
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,117
I WISH WE AT LEAST KNEW HIS NAME.

52
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,919
I KNOW. I HATE THAT THEY'RE CALLING HIM

53
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,321
JOHN DOE. IT'S SO SAD.

54
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,723
IT'S LIKE HE'S A DEER, A FEMALE DEER.

55
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:04,924
PHOEBE...

56
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,726
OH, I WAS GOING TO STOP.

57
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,930
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT FACE?

58
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,633
I MEAN, EVEN SLEEPING, HE LOOKS SMART.

59
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,735
YEAH, BUT DID YOU SEE THE DENTS IN HIS KNUCKLES?

60
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:16,936
THAT MEANS HE'S ARTISTIC.

61
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,838
OKAY. HE'S A LAWYER

62
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:22,041
WHO TEACHES SCULPTING ON THE SIDE.

63
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,243
AND HE CAN DANCE.

64
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,844
AND, HE'S THE KIND OF GUY

65
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,247
WHO, WHEN YOU'RE TALKING, HE'S LISTENING, YOU KNOW

66
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,249
AND NOT SAYING, "YEAH, I UNDERSTAND."

67
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,051
BUT REALLY WONDERING WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE NAKED.

68
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,553
OH, DEFINITELY!

69
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:38,558
I WISH ALL GUYS COULD BE LIKE HIM.

70
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,761
I KNOW.

71
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,067
I DON'T GET IT.

72
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,269
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS GUY.

73
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,271
YEAH, ARE THERE NO CONSCIOUS MEN

74
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,872
IN THE CITY FOR YOU TWO?

75
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,774
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYONE.

76
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:57,177
YEAH. WE FEEL KIND OF RESPONSIBLE.

77
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,579
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SAID "WHOO HOO."

78
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,782
I DON'T EVEN SAY "WHOO HOO."

79
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,584
OH! SHE'S COMING UP! SHE'S COMING UP!

80
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,786
Folks, when we come back, we'll be talking about

81
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,788
her new book Euphoria Unbound.

82
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:09,989
The always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.

83
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,591
You might want to put the kids to bed for this one...

84
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,193
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T HAVE TO WATCH THIS.

85
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,595
WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S IS ON SHOWTIME, HBO,  AND CINEMAX.

86
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:16,796
NO WAY!

87
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:17,797
OH, COME ON.

88
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:18,998
SHE'S YOUR MOM.

89
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:19,899
EXACTLY.

90
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,100
WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S!

91
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,903
DEAD GUY GETTING HIT IN THE GROIN 20, 30 TIMES!

92
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,705
NO?

93
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,307
CHANDLER, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU.

94
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,508
I LOVE YOUR MOM'S BOOKS.

95
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:29,709
I LOVE HER BOOKS.

96
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,711
I CANNOT GET ON A PLANE WITHOUT ONE.

97
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,912
I MEAN, THIS IS SO COOL.

98
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,914
YEAH, WELL, YOU WOULDN'T THINK IT'S COOL

99
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,115
IF YOU WERE 11 YEARS OLD

100
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,117
AND ALL YOUR FRIENDS WERE PASSING AROUND

101
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,319
PAGE 79 OF MISTRESS BITCH.

102
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,321
OH. I REMEMBER PAGE 79.

103
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,121
YOW!

104
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,723
OH, YEAH, THE THING AFTER THE OPERA

105
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,725
WITH THE GIRL WITH THE TRICK HIP, HUH?

106
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,926

107
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,630
COME ON, CHANDLER, I LOVE YOUR MOM.

108
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,431
I THINK SHE'S A BLAST.

109
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,533
YOU CAN SAY THAT BECAUSE SHE'S NOT YOUR MOM.

110
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:54,734
 PLEASE.

111
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,935
BUONA SERA.

112
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,537
HI, SWEETIE.

113
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,541
WHEN DID RIGATONI GET BACK FROM ROME?

114
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,744
LAST NIGHT.

115
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,146
REALLY? SO THEN HIS PLANE DIDN'T EXPLODE

116
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,748
IN A BIG BALL OF FIRE?

117
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,350
JUST A DREAM I HAD.

118
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,752
BUT, PHEW!

119
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,354
HEY! HEY! SHE'S ON!

120
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,360
AH! NORA BING!

121
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,461
Before we get to the book

122
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,662
now what is this about you

123
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,863
being arrested in London?

124
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,064
What is that all about?

125
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,566
YOUR MOM WAS ARRESTED?

126
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:27,867
SHH! SHH!

127
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,869
I'M BUSY BEAMING WITH PRIDE.

128
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,071
THIS IS KIND OF EMBARRASSING, BUT...

129
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:36,175
OCCASIONALLY, AFTER I'VE BEEN INTIMATE WITH A MAN...

130
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:37,777
NOW, WHY WOULD SHE SAY THAT'S EMBARRASSING?

131
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,779
 SHH!

132
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,383
I JUST GET THIS CRAVING FOR KUNG PAO CHICKEN.

133
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,985
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!

134
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,390
 Needless to say

135
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,192
HE GOT A HUGE TIP.

136
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,794

137
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,797
OH, GOD, I LOVE HER!

138
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,600
I THINK I'M HAVING A STROKE.

139
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,703
ALL RIGHT, SO NOW YOU'RE DOING THIS WHOLE BOOK TOUR THING.

140
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:04,504
HOW IS THAT GOING?

141
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,105
OH, FINE. I'M LEAVING

142
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,908
FOR NEW YORK TOMORROW-- WHICH I HATE.

143
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,210
BUT I GET TO SEE MY SON, WHO I LOVE.

144
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,812
 AW!

145
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,615
OH. AND THIS IS THE WAY THAT I FIND OUT.

146
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,216
MOST MOMS USE THE PHONE.

147
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,218
YOU KNOW, I... DON'T TAKE THIS WRONG--

148
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,220
I JUST DON'T SEE YOU AS A MOM

149
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,122
SOMEHOW-- I DON'T MEAN THAT BAD.

150
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,525
OH. NO. I AM A FABULOUS MOM.

151
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,027
I BOUGHT MY SON HIS FIRST CONDOMS.

152
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,436
AND THEN HE BURST INTO FLAMES.

153
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,441
? NOTHING YOU CAN SAY ?

154
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,644
? CAN TEAR ME AWAY FROM MY GUY... ?

155
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,646
 OH. LET'S SEE.

156
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,648
CONGRESS IS DEBATING A NEW DEFICIT REDUCTION BILL.

157
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,851
THE MAYOR WANTS TO RAISE SUBWAY FARES AGAIN.

158
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,454
THE HIGH TODAY WAS 45.

159
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,856
AND... OH, AND TEAMS PLAYED SPORTS.

160
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,758

161
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,861
? ...LIKE BIRDS OF FEATHER, WE STICK TOGETHER ?

162
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,863
? I'M TELLING YOU FROM THE START ?

163
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,867
? I CAN'T BE TORN APART FROM MY GUY ?

164
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,471
? NOTHING YOU CAN DO ?

165
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:15,074
? COULD MAKE ME UNTRUE TO MY GUY ?

166
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,877
?MY GUY?

167
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,078
? NOTHING YOU COULD BUY ?

168
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:22,382
? COULD MAKE ME TELL A LIE TO MY GUY ?

169
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,583
?MY GUY...?

170
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,985
 WHAT ABOUT "GLEN"?

171
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,387
HE COULD BE A "GLEN."

172
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,588
UH UH.

173
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,189
NOT SPECIAL ENOUGH.

174
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,791
OOH, HOW ABOUT "AGAMEMNON"?

175
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,992
WAY TOO SPECIAL.

176
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,594
? YOU BEST BE BELIEVIN' ?

177
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:39,799
? I WON'T BE DECEIVIN' MY GUY. ?

178
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,401

179
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,403
MMM. I AM FAMISHED.

180
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,004
WHAT DO I WANT?

181
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,005
PLEASE, GOD.

182
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,408
DON'T LET IT BE KUNG PAO CHICKEN.

183
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,009
OH! YOU WATCHED THE SHOW!

184
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,611
WHAT DID YOU THINK?

185
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,412
I THINK YOU NEED

186
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,013
TO COME OUT OF YOUR SHELL

187
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,015
JUST A...

188
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,017
WHAT IS THIS DIVE?

189
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,420
ONLY YOU COULD HAVE PICKED THIS PLACE.

190
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,521
OH!

191
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,122
COME ON. SHUT UP. IT'S FUN.

192
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,323
GIVE ME A HUG.

193
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,125
I HEARD ABOUT THE DIVORCE.

194
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,727
LESBIAN, HUH?

195
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,328
YEAH.

196
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,532
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY:

197
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,534
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR.

198
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,739
WELL, I THINK WE'RE READY FOR SOME TEQUILA.

199
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,340
I KNOW I AM. WHO'S DOING SHOTS?

200
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,542
YEAH. I'M IN.

201
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,143
THERE YOU GO... ROSS?

202
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,146
UH, I'M NOT REALLY A SHOT DRINKING KIND OF GUY.

203
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,048
SORRY! SORRY! WE'RE LATE.

204
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,650
WE, UH, KIND OF JUST

205
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,052
YOU KNOW, LOST TRACK OF TIME.

206
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:35,855
BUT A MAN CAN CHANGE.

207
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,664
ANYONE WANT ME TO APPRAISE ANYTHING?

208
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,778
WELL, I'M GOING TO GO TO TINKER TOWN.

209
00:07:58,778 --> 00:07:59,879
MRS. BING, I HAVE TO TELL YOU

210
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,080
I HAVE READ EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER WRITTEN.

211
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,182
NO, I MEAN IT.

212
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,584
I MEAN, WHEN I READ EUPHORIA AT MIDNIGHT

213
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,185
ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS BECOME A WRITER.

214
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:07,487
OH! PLEASE, HONEY!

215
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,489
LISTEN, IF I CAN DO IT, ANYBODY CAN.

216
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,890
YOU JUST START

217
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,692
WITH HALF A DOZEN EUROPEAN CITIES

218
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,694
THROW IN 30 EUPHEMISMS FOR MALE GENITALIA--

219
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,096
AND, BAM! YOU HAVE GOT YOURSELF A BOOK.

220
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:21,300
MY MOTHER, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

221
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:27,006
YEAH. ANY MESSAGES FOR ROOM 226?

222
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,809
YOU OKAY, SLUGGER?

223
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,410
OH. YEAH. I'M FINE. I'M FINE.

224
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,012

225
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,213

226
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,626
WHAT IS WITH YOU TONIGHT?

227
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,426
NOTHING.

228
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,829
NOTHING. NOTHING. NOTHING.

229
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,030
OKAY. THANK YOU.

230
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,231

231
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:57,436
IT'S THE ITALIAN HAND LICKER, ISN'T IT?

232
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:01,040
NO. IT'S THE ONE HE'S LICKING.

233
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,042
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE WITH YOU.

234
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,044
YOU'RE GOOD.

235
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,646
OH, ROSS, LISTEN TO ME.

236
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,648
I HAVE SOLD A HUNDRED MILLION

237
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,050
COPIES OF MY BOOKS-- AND YOU KNOW WHY?

238
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,452
A GIRL ON THE COVER

239
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,855
WITH HER NIPPLES SHOWING?

240
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,058
NO. BECAUSE I KNOW HOW TO WRITE MEN

241
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,460
THAT WOMEN FALL IN LOVE WITH.

242
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,462
BELIEVE ME. I CANNOT SELL A PAOLO.

243
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:26,265
PEOPLE WILL NOT TURN 325 PAGES FOR A PAOLO.

244
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:29,068
COME ON. THE GUY'S A SECONDARY CHARACTER.

245
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,269
HE'S JUST, UH, YOU KNOW

246
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,072
A COMPLICATION YOU EVENTUALLY KILL OFF.

247
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,076
WHEN?

248
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,080
HE'S NOT A HERO.

249
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,082
YOU KNOW WHO OUR HERO IS?

250
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,885
THE GUY ON THE COVER WITH HIS NIPPLES SHOWING?

251
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,287
NO. IT'S YOU.

252
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,088
PLEASE.

253
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:50,690
NO. REALLY. COME ON.

254
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,291
YOU'RE SMART. YOU'RE SEXY.

255
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,492
OH. RIGHT.

256
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,694
YES, YOU ARE.

257
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:57,096
AND THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T THINK YOU ARE

258
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,297
MAKES YOU EVEN SEXIER.

259
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,498
LISTEN TO ME, KIDDO.

260
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,100
YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.

261
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,901
BELIEVE ME.

262
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,307
UH OH.

263
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,121
UH...

264
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,123
I'LL JUST PEE IN THE STREET.

265
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,731

266
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,634
HEY, IS CHANDLER HERE?

267
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,635
YEAH.

268
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,836
OKAY, COME HERE.

269
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,439
OKAY. ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

270
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,441
YOU KNOW. CHANDLER. YOU DIDN'T TELL...

271
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,442
OKAY! BECAUSE I'M THINKING

272
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,044
WE DON'T NEED TO TELL CHANDLER.

273
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,646
I MEAN, IT WAS JUST A KISS, RIGHT?

274
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,247
ONE KISS-- NO BIG DEAL, RIGHT?

275
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,348
RIGHT, NO BIG DEAL.

276
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,349
OKAY.

277
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,151
IN BIZARRO WORLD!

278
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,856
YOU BROKE THE CODE.

279
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:57,857
WHAT CODE?

280
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,459
YOU DON'T KISS YOUR FRIEND'S MOM.

281
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,663
SISTERS ARE OKAY, MAYBE A HOT LOOKING AUNT

282
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,463
BUT NOT A MOM.

283
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:05,765
NEVER A MOM!

284
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,569
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING OUT HERE?

285
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,571
AH, WELL, JOEY AND I HAD DISCUSSED

286
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,974
GETTING IN AN EARLY MORNING RACQUETBALL GAME

287
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:19,278
BUT, APPARENTLY, SOMEBODY OVERSLEPT.

288
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,382
YEAH, WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR RACQUET.

289
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,585
NO. NO, I DON'T BECAUSE IT'S BEING RESTRUNG.

290
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,587
SOMEBODY WAS SUPPOSED TO BRING ME ONE.

291
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,392
YEAH, WELL, YOU DIDN'T CALL AND LEAVE YOUR GRIP SIZE.

292
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,496
YOU GUYS SPEND WAY TOO MUCH TIME TOGETHER.

293
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,500
OKAY, I'M SCUM. I'M SCUM.

294
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,103
ROSS, HOW COULD YOU LET THIS HAPPEN?

295
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,104
I DON'T KNOW!

296
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,506
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S A REGULAR MOM.

297
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,308
YOU KNOW, SHE'S SHE'S SEXY. SHE'S...

298
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,511
YOU DON'T THINK MY MOM'S SEXY?

299
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,613
WELL, NOT IN THE SAME WAY.

300
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,815
HEY!

301
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,616
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW THAT GLORIA TRIBBIANI

302
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,019
WAS A HANDSOME WOMAN IN HER DAY, ALL RIGHT?

303
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,622
YOU THINK IT'S EASY GIVING BIRTH TO SEVEN CHILDREN?

304
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:06,425
HUH?

305
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,628
OKAY. I THINK WE'RE GETTING INTO A WEIRD AREA HERE.

306
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,230
HEY. HEY.

307
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,232
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING OUT HERE?

308
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,836
WELL, NOT PLAYING RACQUETBALL.

309
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,339
HE FORGOT TO LEAVE HIS GRIP SIZE.

310
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,941
HE DIDN'T GET THE GOGGLES.

311
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,142
OH.

312
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,946
WELL... SOUNDS LIKE YOU TWO HAVE ISSUES.

313
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,550
BYE, BABY.

314
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,752
CIAO, BELLA.

315
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,953

316
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,855
DO THEY WAIT FOR ME

317
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,156
TO DO THIS?

318
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,461
SO, ARE YOU GOING TO TELL HIM?

319
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,463
NO, I'M NOT GOING TO TELL HIM.

320
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,664
WHY WOULD I TELL HIM?

321
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:48,467
HOW ABOUT... BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, HIS MOTHER MIGHT?

322
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,468
OH.

323
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,070
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

324
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,074
AH, HE'S NOT EVEN WEARING A JOCK STRAP.

325
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,882
WHAT DID I ASK?

326
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,292
HI.

327
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,095
HI.

328
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,797
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

329
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,299
NOTHING. I JUST THOUGHT I'D STOP BY

330
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,102
YOU KNOW, AFTER THE, AH, THAT I, YOU KNOW.

331
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,703
SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

332
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,306
UM, I'M NOT REALLY HERE.

333
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:31,310
I JUST THOUGHT I'D DROP THESE OFF ON...

334
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,312
THE WAY. MY WAY.

335
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:38,717
DO YOU, UM, COME HERE A LOT...

336
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,119
WITHOUT ME?

337
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,320
NO.

338
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,822
NO! NO!

339
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,026
SO, UM, DO YOU THINK HE'S

340
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,328
DOING ANY BETTER THAN HE WAS THIS MORNING?

341
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,730
HOW WOULD I KNOW?

342
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,732
I I WASN'T HERE.

343
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,835
REALLY? NOT EVEN TO, UM...

344
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,036
CHANGE HIS PAJAMAS?!

345
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,241
OH, MY GOD.

346
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,542
YOU'RE MY FRIEND. I...

347
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,944
I HAD TO TELL YOU.

348
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,446
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

349
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,448
PAOLO KISSED MY MOM?

350
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,351
YEAH. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED

351
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,953
BUT HE HADA LOT TO DRINK.

352
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,855
YOU KNOW HOW HE GETS WHEN HE'S DRU...

353
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:20,659
I CAN'T DO THIS. I DID IT.

354
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:21,961
IT WAS ME. I'M SORRY.

355
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,362
I KISSED YOUR MOM.

356
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,064
WHAT?

357
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,466
I WAS REALLY UPSET ABOUT RACHEL AND PAOLO

358
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,869
AND I THINK I HAD TOO MUCH TEQUILA AND NORA...

359
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,871
UM, MRS. MOM, YOUR BING, WAS, AH...

360
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,873
SHE WAS JUST BEING NICE

361
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,275
YOU KNOW, BUT NOTHING HAPPENED

362
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,877
NOTHING. ASK JOEY.

363
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,777
JOEY CAME IN...

364
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,279
YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS?

365
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,481
UH... YOU KNOW, KNOWLEDGE IS A TRICKY THING.

366
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,384
I SPENT THE ENTIRE DAY WITH YOU.

367
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,386
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

368
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,687
HEY, HEY, HEY. YOU'RE LUCKY I CAUGHT THEM

369
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,689
WHEN I DID, OR ELSE WHO KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED?

370
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,992
THANKS, MAN. BIG HELP.

371
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,193
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

372
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,794
WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING?!

373
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,997
I WASN'T. I DON'T KNOW...

374
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,098
YOU KNOW, OF ALL MY FRIENDS

375
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,299
NO ONE KNOWS THE CRAP I GO THROUGH

376
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:01,500
WITH MY MOM MORE THAN YOU.

377
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,402
I KNOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE

378
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,603
YOU DID THIS.

379
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:05,804
ME NEITHER. YOU KNOW WHAT...?

380
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,406
I'M STILL MAD AT YOU FOR NOT TELLING ME.

381
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,209
YOU GOTTA LET ME SLAM THE DOOR!

382
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,311
CHANDLER, I DIDN'T KISS HER; HE DID.

383
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,313
SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU BREAK THE CODE?

384
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:14,713
JOEY!

385
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,715
AH... UH?!

386
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,324
HI, RACH.

387
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,525
HEY.

388
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:27,726
AH...

389
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,930
A WOMAN UNDONE, BY RACHEL KAREN GREEN.

390
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,932
YEAH. THOUGHT I'D GIVE IT A SHOT.

391
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,934
I'M STILL ON THE FIRST CHAPTER.

392
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,936
NOW, DO YOU THINK HIS LOVE STICK

393
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:41,340
CAN BE LIBERATED FROM ITS DENIM PRISON?

394
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,143
YEAH. I'D SAY SO.

395
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:48,547
AND THERE'S NO "J" IN ENGORGED.

396
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:49,548
HEY, RACH.

397
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,150
HEY. HELLO.

398
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,351
HELLO.

399
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,253
GOING TO THE HOSPITAL TONIGHT?

400
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,654
NO. YOU?

401
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,256
NO. YOU?

402
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,859
YOU JUST ASKED ME.

403
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,163
OKAY. MAYBE IT WAS A TRICK QUESTION.

404
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,865
UM, RACHEL, CAN WE DO THIS NOW?

405
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,668
OKAY.

406
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:13,272
I AM SO HOT!

407
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,875
HERE'S A PICTURE OF MY MOTHER AND FATHER ON THEIR WEDDING DAY.

408
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,877
NOW YOU TELL ME SHE'S NOT A KNOCKOUT.

409
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,379
HUH?

410
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,182
I CANNOT BELIEVE WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.

411
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,985
COME ON. JUST TRY TO PICTURE HER NOT PREGNANT. THAT'S ALL.

412
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:33,392
CENTRAL PERK IS PROUD TO PRESENT MISS PHOEBE BUFFAY.

413
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:34,994
THANKS.

414
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,197
HI. UM, OKAY. I'D LIKE TO START WITH A SONG

415
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,599
THAT'S ABOUT A MAN THAT I RECENTLY MET

416
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,002
WHO'S, UM, COME TO BE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

417
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,006
OKAY.

418
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,812
? YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AWAKE TO BE MY MAN ?

419
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,816
? LONG AS YOU HAVE BRAIN WAVES ?

420
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,020
? I'LL BE THERE TO HOLD YOUR HAND ?

421
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:05,824
? THOUGH WE JUST MET THE OTHER DAY, THERE'S SOMETHING ?

422
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,227
? I HAVE GOT TO SAY... ?

423
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,329
OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

424
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,731
I'M GOING TO TAKE A SHORT BREAK.

425
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:18,337
 HEY, THAT WAS PHOEBE BUFFAY, EVERYBODY.

426
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,739
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

427
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,341
OH, UH, PHOEBE JUST STARTED HER...

428
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,343
I BELIEVE I WAS TALKING TO JOEY.

429
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:27,146
ALL RIGHT THERE, MOTHER KISSER?

430
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,652
MOTHER KISSER!

431
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:34,853
I'LL SHUT UP.

432
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,855
CHANDLER, CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING?

433
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,457
I KNOW YOU'RE STILL MAD AT ME.

434
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,658
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT

435
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,660
THERE WERE TWO PEOPLE THERE THAT NIGHT.

436
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,562
OKAY? THERE WERE TWO SETS OF LIPS.

437
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,164
YES, WELL, I EXPECT THIS FROM HER.

438
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:48,367
OKAY? SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN A FREUDIAN NIGHTMARE.

439
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,069
IF SHE ALWAYS BEHAVES LIKE THIS

440
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,270
WHY DON'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?

441
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,871
BECAUSE IT'S COMPLICATED.

442
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,373
IT'S COMPLEX. IT'S...

443
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,375
HEY! YOU KISSED MY MOM!

444
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,381
WE'RE REHEARSING A GREEK PLAY.

445
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,982
THAT'S VERY FUNNY.

446
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,684
ARE WE DONE NOW? NO.

447
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,686
YOU MEAN, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TALK TO HER?

448
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,288
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL HER HOW YOU FEEL?

449
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,489
THAT WOULD BE A NO.

450
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,891
LOOK, JUST BECAUSE YOU PLAYED TONSIL TENNIS WITH MY MOM

451
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,093
DOESN'T MEAN YOU KNOW HER.

452
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,095
ALL RIGHT, TRUST ME, YOU CAN'T TALK TO HER.

453
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,497
OKAY. YOU CAN'T OR YOU CAN'T?

454
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,799
OKAY. THAT'S MY FINGER.

455
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,603
OKAY. THAT'S MY KNEE.

456
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,205
STILL DOING THE PLAY.

457
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,607

458
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,215
ALL RIGHT. WHAT'D YOU DO WITH HIM?

459
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,717

460
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,919
YOU'RE AWAKE!

461
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,121
LOOK AT YOU!

462
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,722
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

463
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,525
AH, A LITTLE WOOZY BUT BASICALLY OKAY.

464
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,127
GOSH, YOU LOOK GOOD.

465
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,929
I FEEL GOOD.

466
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,131
WHO ARE YOU?

467
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,732
OH, SORRY!

468
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:54,933
I'M PHOEBE BUFFAY.

469
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,736
I'M MONICA GELLER. I'VE BEEN TAKING CARE OF YOU.

470
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:58,937
WELL, WE BOTH HAVE.

471
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,839
SO THE ETCH A SKETCH IS FROM YOU GUYS?

472
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,940
ACTUALLY, IT'S JUST FROM ME.

473
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,542
I GOT YOU THE FOOT MASSAGER.

474
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,544
YOU KNOW WHO SHAVED YOU?

475
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:06,345
THAT WAS ME.

476
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,546
I READ TO YOU.

477
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,148
I SANG. HAH!

478
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,350
WELL... THANKS.

479
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,351
MY PLEASURE.

480
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,552
YOU'RE WELCOME.

481
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,755
SO... I GUESS I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

482
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,057
WHAT, THAT'S IT?

483
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,059
"SEE YOU AROUND"?

484
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,462
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

485
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,164
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

486
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,367
MAYBE, UH, "THAT WAS NICE."

487
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,968
IT MEANT SOMETHING TO ME.

488
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,571
I'LL CALL YOU.

489
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:33,772
ALL RIGHT.

490
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,073
I'LL CALL YOU.

491
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,176
I DON'T THINK YOU MEAN THAT.

492
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,381
THIS IS SO TYPICAL.

493
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,184
YOU KNOW, WE GIVE AND WE GIVE AND WE GIVE

494
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,586
AND THEN WE JUST GET NOTHING BACK

495
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,588
AND THEN ONE DAY, IT'S JUST

496
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,791
YOU KNOW, YOU WAKE UP AND "SEE YOU AROUND."

497
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,397
LET'S GO, PHOEBE.

498
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:00,399
YOU KNOW WHAT?

499
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,401
WE THOUGHT YOU WERE DIFFERENT

500
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,803
BUT I GUESS IT WAS JUST THE COMA.

501
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,814
HEY, KIDDO. CAR'S RUNNING DOWNSTAIRS.

502
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,816
I JUST WANTED TO DROP OFF THESE COPIES

503
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,818
OF MY BOOK FOR YOUR FRIENDS.

504
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:20,619
AUTOGRAPHED.

505
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:23,021
AND GIVE YOU A GOOD BYE KISS.

506
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:24,223
SO... HERE'S A KISS.

507
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:25,824
HERE'S THE GOOD BYE.

508
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,227
ANYTHING YOU WANT FROM LISBON?

509
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,730
NO, NO. JUST KNOWING YOU'RE GOING TO BE THERE IS ENOUGH.

510
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,132
ALL RIGHT, WELL, BE GOOD.

511
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:35,734
I LOVE YOU.

512
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,138
YOU KISSED MY BEST ROSS!

513
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,543
OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT.

514
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:47,145
OKAY.

515
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,552
LOOK, IT WAS STUPID.

516
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,553
REALLY STUPID.

517
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,356
REALLY STUPID AND...

518
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,958
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED.

519
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:04,763
I'M SORRY, HONEY, AND I PROMISE IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

520
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,666
REALLY, REALLY STUPID.

521
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,268
REALLY, REALLY STUPID.

522
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,170
ARE WE OKAY NOW?

523
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,572
YEAH... NO.

524
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:16,375
NO.

525
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:23,181
AH. THE FORBIDDEN LOVE OF A MAN AND HIS DOOR.

526
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,584
SHH!

527
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,386
HE DID IT! HE TOLD HER OFF

528
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:28,987
AND NOT JUST ABOUT THE KISS, ABOUT EVERYTHING.

529
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,088
YOU'RE KIDDING!

530
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,891
HE SAID, "WHEN YOU GONNA GROW UP AND START BEING A MOM?"

531
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,394
WOW! WAIT! SHE THEN CAME BACK WITH

532
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,397
"THE QUESTION IS: WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GROW UP

533
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,998
AND REALIZE I HAVE A BOMB?"

534
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:43,502
OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE. ARE YOU SURE SHE DIDN'T SAY

535
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:47,506
"WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GROW UP AND REALIZEI AM YOUR MOM?"

536
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,811
THAT MAKES MORE SENSE.

537
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,112
YOU THINK? YEAH.

538
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:57,015
SO WHAT'S GOING ON NOW? I DON'T KNOW.

539
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,618
I'VE BEEN STANDING HERE SPELLING IT OUT FOR YOU.

540
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,121
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.

541
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,323
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

542
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,924
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

543
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,727
IT'S HARD TO TELL. THEY'RE SO TINY AND UPSIDE DOWN.

544
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:10,329
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

545
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,532
THEY'RE WALKING AWAY, THEY'RE WALKING AWAY...

546
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:14,733
NO! NO, THEY'RE NOT!

547
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,735
THEY'RE COMING RIGHT AT US!

548
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:17,936
RUN, RUN!

549
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,540
YOU OKAY, KIDDO?

550
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,741
YEAH, I'M OKAY.

551
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,343
ALL RIGHT. YOU BE GOOD.

552
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,544
FLY SAFE.

553
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,548
MRS. BING.

554
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,550
MR. GELLER.

555
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:36,755
HEY.

556
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,258
YOU MEAN THAT?

557
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,260
YEAH.

558
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,563
WHY NOT?

559
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:46,965
SO I TOLD HER.

560
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,367
OH... HOW DID IT GO?

561
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:49,668
AWFUL... AWFUL.

562
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,269
COULDN'T HAVE GONE WORSE.

563
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:54,673
WELL... HOW DO YOU FEEL?

564
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:55,774
PRETTY GOOD.

565
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,478
I TOLD HER.

566
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:00,479
WELL, SEE?

567
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,481
SO MAYBE IT WASN'T SUCH A BAD IDEA

568
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,483
YOU KNOW, ME KISSING YOUR MOM.

569
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:05,484
HUH? HUH?

570
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:08,286
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD.

572
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,498
OKAY. NOW, THIS IS JUST THE FIRST CHAPTER

573
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,300
AND I WANT YOUR ABSOLUTE HONEST OPINION. OKAY?

574
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:28,006
OH! AND ON PAGE TWO, HE'S NOT REACHING FOR HER HEAVING BEASTS.

575
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,409
WHY? SHE COULD HAVE HEAVING BEASTS.

576
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,413
RIGHT, RIGHT. BUT IN THIS CASE, SHE DOESN'T.

577
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,814
WHAT'S A NIFFLE?

578
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:38,917
YOU CAN USUALLY FIND THEM ON THE HEAVING BEASTS.

579
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,419
OH!

580
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,221
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. SO I'M NOT A GREAT TYPIST.

581
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:46,425
WAIT. DID YOU GET TO THE PART ABOUT HIS HUGE THROBBING PENS?

582
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,427
I TELL YOU, DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND

583
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,429
WHEN HE STARTS WRITING WITH THOSE.

584
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,932
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT, GIVE THEM BACK.

585
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,133
NO. OH, NO.

586
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,635
OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, NO.

587
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,037
NO, I JUST GOT TO THE PART ABOUT HER PUBLIC HAIR.

588
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,540
COME ON, THAT'S IT! COME ON!
