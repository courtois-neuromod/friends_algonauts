2
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:05,205
HI, GUYS!

3
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,006
HEY, PHOEBE!

4
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,707
HEY, OH, HOW DID IT GO?

5
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:08,808
UM, NOT SO GOOD.

6
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:11,211
HE SAID, "WE SHOULD DO THIS AGAIN."

8
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:14,714
WHAT? "WE SHOULD DO IT AGAIN."

9
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:15,915
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

10
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:17,517
NO, LOOSELY TRANSLATED

11
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,519
"WE SHOULD DO THIS AGAIN" MEANS

12
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,521
"YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME NAKED."

13
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,722
SINCE WHEN?

14
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,324
SINCE ALWAYS.

15
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:27,527
IT'S LIKE DATING LANGUAGE.

16
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:31,031
YOU KNOW, LIKE, "IT'S NOT YOU" MEANS "IT IS YOU."

17
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,034
OR "YOU'RE SUCH A NICE GUY" MEANS:

18
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,836
"I'LL BE DATING LEATHER WEARING ALCOHOLICS

19
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:37,637
"AND COMPLAINING

20
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,139
ABOUT THEM TO YOU."

21
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,841
OR "I THINK WE SHOULD SEE OTHER PEOPLE"

22
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,843
MEANS "HA, HA, I ALREADY AM."

23
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,446
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS.

24
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,948
OH, YEAH... CUSHIONS THE BLOW.

25
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,451
LIKE WHEN YOU'RE A KID AND YOUR PARENTS PUT YOUR DOG TO SLEEP

26
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,853
AND THEY TELL YOU IT WENT OFF TO LIVE ON SOME FARM.

27
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:55,255
THAT'S FUNNY.

28
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,458
NO, BECAUSE OUR PARENTS ACTUALLY DID

29
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,860
SEND OUR DOG UP TO LIVE ON A FARM.

30
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,663
UH... ROSS?

31
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:07,367
WHAT, HELLO? THE MILNERS' FARM IN CONNECTICUT?

32
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,769
THE MILNERS HAD THIS UNBELIEVABLE FARM.

33
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,371
THEY HAD HORSES

34
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,772
AND RABBITS TO CHASE

35
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,074
AND...

36
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:19,779
OH, MY GOD, CHI CHI!

50
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:16,336
 "SO HOW DOES IT FEEL KNOWING YOU'RE ABOUT TO DIE?"

51
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,139
"WARDEN, IN FIVE MINUTES MY PAIN WILL BE OVER

52
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,540
"BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO LIVE

53
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,144
WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU SENT AN HONEST MAN TO DIE."

54
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,945
HEY, THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.

55
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,047
YEAH? THANKS, LET'S KEEP GOING.

56
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,249
OKAY.

57
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:33,653
"SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME, DIMONE... HUH?"

58
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,857
"I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO MY CELL

59
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:40,260
BECAUSE IN MY CELL I CAN SMOKE."

60
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,161
"SMOKE AWAY!"

61
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,176
I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY WHY

62
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,978
DIMONE SMOKES IN HIS CELL, ALONE.

63
00:02:58,978 --> 00:02:59,979
WHAT?

64
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,981
RELAX YOUR HAND.

65
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,683
LET YOUR WRIST GO.

66
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,083
NOT SO MUCH.

67
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:04,584
WHOA.

68
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:04,884
HEY.

69
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,886
HEY.

70
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,889
ALL RIGHT, NOW, TRY TAKING A PUFF.

71
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,692
RIGHT.

72
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,294
OKAY, NO, GIVE IT TO ME.

73
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,796
NO, NO, I'M NOT GIVING YOU A CIGARETTE.

74
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,598
DO YOU WANT TO GET THIS PART

75
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,600
OR NOT? HERE.

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,901
ALL RIGHT, NOW

77
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,903
DON'T THINK OF IT AS A CIGARETTE.

78
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,505
THINK OF IT AS THE THING

79
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,106
THAT HAS BEEN MISSING

80
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,308
FROM YOUR HAND.

81
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:32,712
WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING IT, YOU FEEL RIGHT, YOU FEEL COMPLETE.

82
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,913
DO YOU MISS IT?

83
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,815
NO, NOT SO MUCH.

84
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,819
ALL RIGHT, NOW WE SMOKE.

85
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,024
OH, MY GOD!

86
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,626
CHANDLER, GIVE ME THAT.

87
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,627
NO, NO, NO. YOU GOT YOUR OPTIONS.

88
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,828
YOU CAN SMOKE IT LIKE THIS...

89
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,230
CHANDLER...

90
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,131
OR YOU CAN JUST HOLD IT IN YOUR MOUTH AND SMOKE IT LIKE THIS.

91
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:52,932
CHANDLER, GIVE ME THE CIGARETTE.

92
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,133
GIMME, GIMME.

93
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,335
ALL RIGHT, YOU TRY.

94
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,936
THANK YOU. OKAY, HOW'S THIS?

95
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,341
OKAY, THAT'S NOT BAD.

96
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,542
YEAH?

97
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,143
ALL RIGHT, NOW, WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED

98
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:05,745
IT'S REALLY COOL IF YOU FLICK IT.

99
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,946
YOU KIND OF FLICK IT.

100
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,348
YOU FLICK IT.

101
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,549
THAT'S GOOD.

102
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,150
ALL RIGHT, YOU KEEP PRACTICING

103
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,152
AND, UH... I'LL GO PUT OUT THE SOFA.

104
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,660
I THOUGHT IT HAD TO DO WITH THE SIZE OF A GUY'S FEET.

105
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,861
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

106
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,863
THEY SAY IT'S THE SAME AS THE DISTANCE

107
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,666
FROM THE TIP OF A GUY'S THUMB TO THE TIP OF HIS INDEX FINGER.

108
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,074
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

109
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,878
CAN I USE EITHER THUMB?

110
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,681
I'D RATHER GO WITH THE FOOT THEORY.

111
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,384
ALL RIGHT, DON'T TELL ME, DON'T TELL ME.

112
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,587
DECAF CAPPUCCINO FOR JOEY.

113
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,591
COFFEE BLACK.

114
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,793
LATTE.

115
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,997
AND AN ICED TEA.

116
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,299
I'M GETTING PRETTY GOOD AT THIS.

117
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,600
EXCELLENT!

118
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,401
VERY GOOD.

119
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,002
GOOD FOR ME!

120
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:16,816

121
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,817
YOU OKAY, PHOEBE?

122
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,818
YEAH, NO, I'M...

123
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,220
IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH IT-- IT'S MY BANK.

124
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,722
WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU?

125
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:23,823
IT'S JUST... OKAY.

126
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,425
I'M GOING THROUGH MY MAIL

127
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,827
AND I OPEN UP THEIR MONTHLY STATEMENT!

128
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,028
EASY!

129
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,030
OKAY, I KNOW.

130
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,833
AND THERE'S 500 DOLLARS EXTRA IN MY ACCOUNT.

131
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:37,837
OH, SATAN'S MINIONS AT WORK AGAIN.

132
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,540
YES, BECAUSE NOW I HAVE TO GO DOWN THERE AND DEAL WITH THEM.

133
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,442
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? KEEP IT!

134
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,544
IT'S NOT MINE. I DIDN'T EARN IT.

135
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,946
IF I KEPT IT, IT WOULD BE LIKE STEALING.

136
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:50,550
YEAH, BUT IF YOU SPENT IT, IT WOULD BE LIKE SHOPPING.

137
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,854
OKAY, OKAY, LET'S SAY I BOUGHT A REALLY GREAT PAIR OF SHOES.

138
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,458
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'D HEAR WITH EVERY STEP I TOOK?

139
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,860
"NOT MINE, NOT MINE, NOT MINE."

140
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,063
EVEN IF I WAS HAPPY, AND SKIPPING, I'D HEAR

141
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,866
"NOT, NOT MINE, NOT, NOT MINE..."

142
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,668
WE'RE WITH YOU, WE GOT IT.

143
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,570
OKAY. I'D NEVER BE ABLE ENJOY IT.

144
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,972
IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS GIANT KARMIC DEBT.

145
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,974
 CHANDLER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

146
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,378
HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

147
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,883
OH, GROSS!

148
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,385
WHAT IS THIS?

149
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,686
I'M SMOKING, I'M SMOKING.

150
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:27,887
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU!

151
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,489
YOU'VE BEEN SO GOOD FOR THREE YEARS.

152
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:33,493
AND THIS IS MY REWARD.

153
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,694
HOLD ON A SECOND, ALL RIGHT?

154
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,096
JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH THE LAST TIME YOU QUIT.

155
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,297
YOU KNOW WHAT? FORGET ABOUT YOU.

156
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,700
THINK ABOUT WHAT WE WENT THROUGH THE LAST TIME YOU QUIT.

157
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,802
OKAY, SO THIS TIME I WON'T QUIT.

158
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,103
PUT IT OUT!

159
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,705
I'M PUTTING IT OUT.

160
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:50,910
OH, NO! I CAN'T DRINK THIS NOW.

161
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,915
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO GO CHANGE.

162
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,716
I'VE GOT A DATE.

163
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,418
WITH ALAN AGAIN?

164
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,619
HOW'S IT GOING?

165
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,821
IT'S GOING PRETTY GOOD, YOU KNOW.

166
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,823
HE'S NICE, WE'RE HAVING FUN.

167
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,425
SO WHEN DO WE GET TO MEET THE GUY?

168
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,427
LET'S SEE, TODAY IS MONDAY.

169
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,628
NEVER.

170
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,431
NO, NOT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED WITH STEVE.

171
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,433
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

172
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,635
WE LOVED SCHTEVE.

173
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,836
SCHTEVE WAS SCHEXY.

174
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,239
SORRY.

175
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,642
LOOK, I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT HIM YET.

176
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,243
JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

177
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,445
WELL, THEN CAN WE MEET HIM?

178
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,449
MMM... NO... SCHORRY.

179
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,852
JOEY, JOEY...

180
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,053
LET IT GO.

181
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:40,059
 I MEAN, WHY SHOULD I LET THEM MEET HIM?

182
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,060
I MEAN, I BRING A GUY HOME

183
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,062
AND WITHIN FIVE MINUTES THEY'RE ALL OVER HIM.

184
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:46,966
THEY'RE LIKE COYOTES PICKING OFF THE WEAK MEMBERS OF THE HERD.

185
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:52,271
LISTEN, AS SOMEONE WHO'S SEEN MORE THAN HER SHARE OF BAD BEEF

186
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:56,075
THAT IS NOT SUCH A TERRIBLE THING.

187
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,677
COME ON, NOW, THEY'RE YOUR FRIENDS

188
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,878
THEY'RE JUST LOOKING OUT AFTER YOU.

189
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:02,482
JUST WISH THAT ONCE I'D BRING A GUY HOME THEY ACTUALLY LIKED.

190
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,284
WELL, YOU DO REALIZE THAT THE ODDS OF THAT HAPPENING

191
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:08,087
ARE A LITTLE SLIMMER IF THEY NEVER GET TO MEET THE GUY.

192
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:08,988
I KNOW, I KNOW.

193
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,390
DO YOU MIND IF I WHIMPER A LITTLE BIT?

194
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,191
WHIMPER.

195
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,894

196
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,496
OKAY, I'M DONE.

197

00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:39,318

204
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,722
YOU CAN COME IN

205
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,525

206
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,132

00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,045

00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,247
"THIS FOOTBALL PHONE...

214
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,450
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS?

215
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,654

216
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,558
WHAT BANK IS THIS?

217
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,358

218
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,260
OKAY, IT'S HIM.

219
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,262

HOW ABOUT CLOSED. YEAH.

227
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,175
I DIDN'T KNOW.

228
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:36,976
YEAH.

229
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,177

230
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,378
OH, OKAY.

231
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:40,580

232
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,582
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW MUCH YOU ALL LIKE ME?

233
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,183

234
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,587
HI, ALAN, THIS IS EVERYBODY.

235
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,988
EVERYBODY, THIS IS ALAN.

236
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,190
HI.

237
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,491
 HI, ALAN.

238
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:56,596
I'VE HEARD SCHO MUSCH ABOUT ALL YOU GUYS.

239
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,405
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW. THANKS.

240
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:12,411
OKAY... OKAY, LET'S LET THE ALAN BASHING BEGIN.

241
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:15,615
WHO'S GOING TO TAKE THE FIRST SHOT? HMM?

242
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,918
COME ON!

243
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,419
I'LL GO.

244
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:26,025
LET'S START WITH THE WAY HE KEPT PICKING AT...

245
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,728
YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY, I CAN'T DO THIS.

246
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:29,528
WE LOVED HIM.

247
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:30,830
 WE LOVED HIM!

248
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,431
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE

249
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,433
THAT I'M GOING OUT WITH?

250
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,635
 YES!

251
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,236
THAT PIMENTO TRICK?

252
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,139
I WILL NEVER LOOK AT AN OLIVE THE SAME WAY AGAIN.

253
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,441
AND DID YOU NOTICE?

255
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:48,648
YOU KNOW WHAT WAS GREAT?

256
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,650
THE WAY HIS SMILE WAS KIND OF CROOKED.

257
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,052
YES, YES, LIKE THE MAN IN THE SHOE.

258
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,854
WHAT SHOE?

259
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,856
FROM THE NURSERY RHYME:

260
00:10:56,856 --> 00:11:00,059
"THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN WHO HAD A CROOKED SMILE

261
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,862
"WHO LIVED IN A SHOE FOR A... WHILE."

262
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,367
SO I THINK ALAN... WILL BECOME THE YARDSTICK

263
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:12,772
AGAINST WHICH ALL FUTURE BOYFRIENDS WILL BE MEASURED.

264
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,373
WHAT FUTURE BOYFRIENDS?

265
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,375
NO, I THINK THIS COULD BE...

266
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,576
REALLY?

267
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:18,778
OH, YEAH. I'D MARRY HIM

268
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,780
JUST FOR HIS DAVID HASSELHOFF IMPRESSION ALONE.

269
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,182
YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO BE

270
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,584
DOING THAT AT PARTIES, RIGHT?

271
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,089
YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE MOST ABOUT HIM?

272
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:30,890
WHAT?

273
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,894
THE WAY HE MAKES ME FEEL ABOUT MYSELF.

274
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:40,099
YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. YEAH.

275
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:53,813
HI.

276
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,217
HOW WAS THE GAME?

277
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,720
WELL...

278
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,321
 WE WON!

279
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,522
THANK YOU! YES!

280
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,925
FANTASTIC! I HAVE ONE QUESTION.

281
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,126
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

282
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:08,427
ALAN.

283
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,628
HE WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

284
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,630
HE WAS LIKE THAT BUGS BUNNY CARTOON

285
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,433
WHERE BUGS IS PLAYING ALL THE POSITIONS

286
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,435
BUT INSTEAD OF BUGS IT WAS FIRST BASE, ALAN;

287
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,838
SECOND BASE, ALAN; THIRD BASE, ALAN.

288
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,244
I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE HE MADE US INTO A TEAM.

289
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,047
YEP, WE SURE SHOWED THOSE HASIDIC JEWELERS

290
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,449
A THING OR TWO ABOUT SOFTBALL.

291
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,251
CAN I ASK YOU GUYS A QUESTION?

292
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,855
DO YOU EVER THINK THAT ALAN IS MAYBE SOMETIMES...

293
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:36,956
WHAT?

294
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,358
I DON'T KNOW, A LITTLE TOO ALAN?

295
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,761
OH, NO, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

296
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,763
ONE CAN NEVER BE TOO ALAN.

297
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,466
YEAH, IT'S HIS INNATE ALAN NESS THAT WE ADORE.

298
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:51,070
I PERSONALLY COULD HAVE A GALLON OF ALAN.

299
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,179
HEY, LIZZY.

300
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,181

DID YOU PICK OUT THE VOWELS?

303
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,986
YES, BUT I LEFT IN THE "Y"s

304
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,388

305
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:10,589

SALTINES?

307
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,394
NO, BUT WOULD YOU LIKE 1,000 DOLLARS AND A FOOTBALL PHONE?

308
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,595
WHAT?

309
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,398
OH, MY GOD!

310
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,400
OH, MY GOD, THERE'S REALLY MONEY IN HERE.

311
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,201
I KNOW.

312
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,203
WEIRD GIRL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

313
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,205
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT. I DON'T WANT IT.

314
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,408
NO, NO, I HAVE TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING.

315
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,410
NO, IT'S FINE, YOU DON'T...

316
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,412
DO YOU WANT MY TINFOIL HAT?

317
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,414
NO, BECAUSE YOU NEED THAT.

318
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,615
NO, IT'S OKAY.

319
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:39,018
PLEASE, LET ME DO SOMETHING.

320
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,219
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

321
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,422
YOU BUY ME A SODA, AND THEN WE'RE EVEN, OKAY?

322
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,024
OKAY.

323
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,225
OKAY.

324
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,889
KEEP THE CHANGE.

325
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,090
THANKS, LIZZY.

326
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,092
SURE YOU DON'T WANT A PRETZEL?

327
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,293
NO, I'M FINE, THANKS.

328
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,895
SEE YOU.

329
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,302
HUH!

330
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,303
A THUMB?

331
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,006
EWW!

332
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,408
I KNOW, I KNOW, I OPENED IT UP

333
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,110
AND THERE IT WAS JUST FLOATING IN THERE

334
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,711
LIKE THIS TINY LITTLE HITCHHIKER.

335
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:17,416
MAYBE IT'S A CONTEST, LIKE, COLLECT ALL FIVE.

336
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,220
DOES ANYONE WANT TO SEE?

337
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,621
 NO!

338
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,223
OH, HEY, DON'T DO THAT.

339
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:25,424
PUT THAT OUT.

340
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,025
COME ON!

341
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,027
IT'S WORSE THAN THE THUMB.

342
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,430
HEY, THIS IS SO UNFAIR.

343
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,032
WHY IS IT UNFAIR?

344
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,233
SO I HAVE A FLAW.

345
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,434
BIG DEAL!

346
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,836
LIKE JOEY'S CONSTANT KNUCKLE CRACKING

347
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,038
ISN'T ANNOYING?

348
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,240
AND ROSS WITH HIS OVER PRONOUNCING EVERY SINGLE WORD;

349
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,043
AND MONICA WITH THAT SNORT WHEN SHE LAUGHS.

350
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,244
I MEAN

351
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,246
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT THING?

352
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,847
I ACCEPT ALL THOSE FLAWS.

353
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:51,250
WHY CAN'T YOU ACCEPT ME FOR THIS?

354
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:04,263
DOES THE KNUCKLE CRACKING BOTHER EVERYBODY OR JUST HIM?

355
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:07,466
WELL, I COULD LIVE WITHOUT IT.

356
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,970
OH, WELL, IS IT, LIKE, A LITTLE ANNOYING

357
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,173
OR IS IT LIKE WHEN PHOEBE CHEWS HER HAIR?

358
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,478
NOW, DON'T LISTEN TO HIM, PHEEBS.

359
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,080
I THINK IT'S END EARING.

360
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,382
OH, YOU DO, DO YOU?

361
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,585

362
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:32,992
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH SPEAKING CORRECTLY.

363
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,894
INDEED, THERE ISN'T.

364
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,598
I SHOULD REALLY GET BACK TO WORK.

365
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,200
YEAH, OTHERWISE SOMEONE MIGHT GET

366
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,401
WHAT THEY ACTUALLY ORDERED.

367
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,403
 OOH, WELL!

368
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:48,807
OH, HO, HO, THE HAIR COMES OUT AND THE GLOVES COME OFF.

369
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:55,214

370
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,025
DID YOU EVER GO OUT WITH A GUY

371
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,027
YOUR FRIENDS ALL REALLY LIKED?

372
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,429
NO.

373
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,031
OKAY. WELL, I'M GOING OUT

374
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,833
WITH A GUY MY FRIENDS ALL REALLY LIKE.

375
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,337
WERE WE TALKING ABOUT THE COYOTES HERE?

376
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,938
ALL RIGHT!

377
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,940
A COW GOT THROUGH!

378
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,743
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

379
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:26,645
IT'S JUST... YOU KNOW WHAT?

380
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,647
I JUST DON'T FEEL THE THING.

381
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:32,651
I MEAN, THEY FEEL THE THING, I DON'T FEEL THE THING.

382
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:37,556
HONEY, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS FEEL THE THING.

383
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:42,361
LISTEN, IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE GUY, MONICA, DUMP HIM.

384
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,164
I KNOW, IT'S JUST GOING TO BE REALLY HARD.

385
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,965
YEAH, HE'S A BIG BOY, HE'LL GET OVER IT.

386
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,967
NO, HE'LL BE FINE.

387
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:52,571
IT'S THE OTHER FIVE I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

388
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,373
DO YOU HAVE ANY RESPECT FOR YOUR BODY?

389
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,675
DON'T YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO YOURSELF?

390
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,078
I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU GUYS AND YOUR CANCER

391
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,080
AND YOUR EMPHYSEMA AND YOUR HEART DISEASE.

392
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,882
THE BOTTOM LINE IS SMOKING IS COOL AND YOU KNOW IT.

393
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,289
CHANDLER... IT'S ALAN, HE WANTS TO SPEAK TO YOU.

394
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,491
REALLY, HE DOES?

395
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:16,495
HEY, BUDDY, WHAT'S UP?

396
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:20,499
OH, SHE TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT, HUH?

397
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:23,702
WELL, YEAH, I HAVE ONE NOW AND THEN.

398
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,304
WELL, YEAH, NOW.

399
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,606
WELL, IT'S NOT THAT...

400
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,210
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

401
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:38,417
GEE, YOU KNOW, NO ONE'S EVER PUT IT LIKE THAT BEFORE.

402
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,819
SO, WELL, OKAY, THANKS.

403
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,030
GOD, HE'S GOOD.

404
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,234
IF ONLY HE WERE A WOMAN.

405
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,236
YEAH.

406
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,042
And Lamb Chop and Hush Puppy...

407
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:07,646
HOW OLD IS THAT SOCK?

408
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,849
IF I HAD A SOCK ON MY HAND FOR 30 YEARS

409
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,252
IT'D BE TALKING, TOO.

410
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,254
OKAY, I THINK IT'S TIME TO CHANGE

411
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,857
SOMEBODY'S NICOTINE PATCH.

412
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,459
HEY!

413
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,861
WHERE'S JOEY?

414
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,763
JOEY ATE MY LAST STICK OF GUM

415
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:25,964
SO I KILLED HIM.

416
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,968
DO YOU THINK THAT WAS WRONG?

417
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,571
I THINK HE'S ACROSS THE HALL.

418
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,173
THANKS.

419
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,974
THERE YOU GO.

420
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:39,178
OOH, I'M ALIVE WITH PLEASURE NOW.

421
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,980
HEY, PHEEBS, YOU GOING TO HAVE

422
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,783
THE REST OF THAT POP TART? PHEEBS?

423
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,385
DOES ANYONE WANT

424
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,387
THE REST OF THIS POP TART?

425
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,590
HEY, I MIGHT.

426
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,592
SORRY.

427
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,395
YOU KNOW, THOSE STUPID SODA PEOPLE GAVE ME

428
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,596
7,000 DOLLARS FOR THE THUMB.

429
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:58,797
7,000 DOLLARS?

430
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,399
AND ON MY WAY OVER HERE

431
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,100
I STEPPED IN GUM.

432
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,104
WHAT IS UP WITH THE UNIVERSE?

433
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,005
WHAT'S GOING ON?

434
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,007
NOTHING, I JUST THINK IT'S NICE

435
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,009
WHEN WE'RE ALL HERE TOGETHER.

436
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,112
EVEN NICER WHEN EVERYONE GETS TO WEAR THEIR UNDERWEAR.

437
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,316
UH, JOEY.

438
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,117
OH.

439
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,721
OH, OKAY.

440
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,622

441
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:24,823
PLEASE, GUYS

442
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,024
WE HAVE TO TALK.

443
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,226
WAIT, WAIT.

444
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,027
I'M GETTING A DEJA VU.

445
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,629
NO, I'M NOT.

446
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,533
ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE TO TALK.

447
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:35,734
THERE IT IS!

448
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,739
OKAY, IT'S ABOUT ALAN.

449
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,741
OH! SPEAKING OF WHICH, WOULD YOU TELL HIM WE'RE ON

450
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,343
FOR THE RENAISSANCE FAIRE NEXT WEEKEND.

451
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,445

452
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,847
GUYS, BEFORE YOU GET INTO THAT, THERE'S SOMETHING

453
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,349
THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

454
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:54,353
I MEAN, THERE'S REALLY NO EASY WAY TO SAY THIS.

455
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,155
I'VE DECIDED TO BREAK UP WITH ALAN.

456
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,763
IS THERE SOMEBODY ELSE?

457
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,967
NO, NO, NO, NO, IT'S JUST...

458
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:12,170
YOU KNOW, THINGS CHANGE, PEOPLE CHANGE.

459
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,973
WE DIDN'T CHANGE.

460
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,877
SO THAT'S IT? IT'S OVER?

461
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,781
JUST LIKE THAT?

462
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,183
YOU KNOW, YOU LET YOUR GUARD DOWN

463
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:28,387
YOU KNOW, YOU START TO REALLY CARE ABOUT SOMEONE

464
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,588
AND I JUST... I...

465
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,592
LOOK, I CAN GO ON PRETENDING...

466
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:34,693
OKAY.

467
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:35,494
NO.

468
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:36,695
THAT WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO ME

469
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,697
IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO ALAN, IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO YOU.

470
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,999
YEAH, WELL, WHO WANTS FAIR?

471
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,402
I MEAN, I JUST WANT THINGS BACK

472
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,404
YOU KNOW, THE WAY THEY WERE.

473
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:48,206
I'M SORRY.

474
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,408
OH, SHE'S SORRY.

475
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,009
I FEEL BETTER.

476
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,713
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

477
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,916
I MEAN, WITH THE HOLIDAYS COMING UP.

478
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,319
I WANTED HIM TO MEET MY FAMILY.

479
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,820
I'LL MEET SOMEONE ELSE.

480
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,422
THERE'LL BE OTHER ALANS.

481
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,023
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

482
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:11,029
ARE YOU GUYS GONNA BE OKAY?

483
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,931
HEY, HEY, WE'LL BE FINE.

484
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:16,134
WE'RE JUST GOING TO NEED A LITTLE TIME.

485
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,437
I UNDERSTAND.

486
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,543
WOW!

487
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,445
I'M REALLY SORRY.

488
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,246
YEAH. I'M SORRY, TOO.

489
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:32,250
BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU, I AM A LITTLE RELIEVED.

490
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,251
RELIEVED?

491
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:36,755
WELL, I MEAN, I HAD A GREAT TIME WITH YOU...

492
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,157
I JUST CAN'T STAND YOUR FRIENDS.

493
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:51,169
REMEMBER WHEN WE WENT TO CENTRAL PARK AND RENTED BOATS?

494
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,572
THAT WAS FUN.

495
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:54,773
YEAH.

496
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,376
HE COULD ROW LIKE A VIKING.

497
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,681
HI.

498
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,483

499
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,386
SO HOW'D IT GO?

500
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,988
UH... YOU KNOW.

501
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,990
DID... DID HE MENTION US?

502
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,498
HE SAYS HE'S REALLY GOING TO MISS YOU GUYS.

503
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,999

504
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:27,906
YOU HAD A ROUGH DAY, HUH?

505
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,308
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

506
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,910
COME HERE.

507
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,214
THAT'S IT, I'M GETTING CIGARETTES.

508
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,215
 NO, NO, NO!

509
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,417
I DON'T CARE.

510
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,218
GAME'S OVER, I'M WEAK. I'VE GOTTA SMOKE.

511
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,420
I'VE GOTTA HAVE THE SMOKE!

512
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,021
 IF YOU NEVER SMOKE AGAIN

513
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,523
I'LL GIVE YOU $7,000.

514
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,525
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
