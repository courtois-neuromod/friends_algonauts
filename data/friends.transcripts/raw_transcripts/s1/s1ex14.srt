1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:00,800

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,404
I'M TELLING YOU, ROSS, SHE WANTS YOU.

3
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:05,605
SHE BARELY KNOWS ME.

4
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:07,207
WE JUST LIVE IN THE SAME BUILDING.

5
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,408
ANY CONTACT?

6
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:09,809
SHE LENT ME AN EGG ONCE.

7
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:11,311
YOU'RE IN.

8
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:14,414
OH, RIGHT.

9
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:15,115
HI, ROSS.

10
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,117
HI, K K K...

11
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:18,718

12
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,522
COME ON, ROSS.

13
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,924
YOU GOT TO GET BACK IN THE GAME HERE, OKAY?

14
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:26,226
THE RACHEL'S NOT HAPPENING

15
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,128
YOUR EX WIFE'S A LESBIAN...

16
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,631
I DON'T THINK WE NEED A THIRD.

17
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,633
EXCUSE ME, COULD WE GET AN EGG OVER HERE

18
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,235
STILL IN THE SHELL? THANKS.

19
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:36,836
AN EGG?

20
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:39,339
YEAH. YOU'RE GOING TO GO UP TO HER AND SAY

21
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:40,540
"HERE'S YOUR EGG BACK.

22
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,142
I'M RETURNING YOUR EGG."

23
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,544
I THINK IT'S WINNING.

24
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,146
COME ON. I THINK IT'S INSANE.

25
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,147
SHE'LL LOVE IT.

26
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,548
THANK YOU.

27
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:49,749
THANK YOU.

28
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,351
HERE.

29
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:54,354

30
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,156
GO WITH THE EGG, MY FRIEND.

31
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,660
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO, GO.

32
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,662
IS IT GOING TO WORK?

33
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,264
NO WAY. IT'S SUICIDE.

34
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,465
THE MAN'S GOT AN EGG.

48
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,117
YOU CANNOT DO THIS.

49
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,718
WHAT? DO WHAT?

50
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,520
ROGER WANTS TO TAKE HER OUT TOMORROW NIGHT.

51
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,723
NO, PHEEBS! DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHY YOU DUMPED THE GUY?

52
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,326
BECAUSE HE WAS CREEPY.

53
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,728
AND MEAN, AND A LITTLE FRIGHTENING.

54
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,531
STILL, IT'S NICE TO HAVE A DATE ON VALENTINE'S DAY.

55
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,133
HI. HI.

56
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,135
PHOEBE, YOU CAN GO OUT WITH A CREEPY GUY

57
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,736
ANY NIGHT OF THE YEAR.

58
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,738
I KNOW I DO.

59
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:19,939
HI.

60
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,141
HI. HI.

61
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,743
WH WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING TOMORROW NIGHT?

62
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:24,744
ACTUALLY, TOMORROW NIGHT

63
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,346
KIND OF DEPENDS ON HOW TONIGHT GOES.

64
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:27,947
OH, UH, LISTEN, ABOUT TONIGHT...

65
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:29,849
NO, NO, NO, DON'T YOU DARE BAIL ON ME.

66
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,851
THE ONLY REASON SHE'S GOING OUT WITH ME

67
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,254
IS BECAUSE I SAID I COULD BRING A FRIEND FOR HER FRIEND.

68
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,656
YES, I KNOW, BUT HER FRIEND SOUNDS LIKE SUCH A...

69
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,557
PATHETIC MESS.

70
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,159
I KNOW, BUT...

71
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,360
COME ON, MAN.

72
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,961
SHE'S NEEDY, SHE'S VULNERABLE.

73
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,963
I'M THINKING... CHA CHING.

74
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,469
THANKS.

75
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,971
LOOK, YOU HAVE NOT BEEN OUT

76
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,173
WITH A WOMAN SINCE JANICE.

77
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,374
YOU'RE DOING THIS.

78
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,475
HI.

79
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,076
HI. HI.

80
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,278
SHE SAID YES.

81
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,078
OH, YES!

82
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,080
WAY TO GO, MAN!

83
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,182

84
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:03,883
STILL GOT THE EGG, HUH?

85
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:04,684
YEAH.

86
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,199
HOW DO I LOOK?

87
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,001
OH, UM... I DON'T CARE.

88
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,606
THERE'S LORRAINE.

89
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:27,807
OKAY, NOW REMEMBER--

90
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,108
NO TRADING.

91
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,511
YOU GET THE PRETTY ONE, I GET THE MESS.

92
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,012
HI, JOEY.

93
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,214
HEY.

94
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,819
WELL, WELL, LOOK WHAT YOU BROUGHT.

95
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,821
VERY NICE.

96
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,624
AND WHAT DID YOU BRING?

97
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,626
SHE'S CHECKING HER COAT.

98
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:50,630
JOEY, I'M GOING TO GO WASH THE CAB SMELL OFF MY HANDS.

99
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,433
WILL YOU GET ME A WHITE ZINFANDEL

100
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,435
AND A GLASS OF RED FOR JANICE.

101
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,441
JANICE?

102
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,042
NO.

103
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,445
JANICE?

104
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:10,250
OH... MY... GOD.

105
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,656
HEY, IT'S JANICE.

106
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,463
OKAY, I'M MAKING A BREAK FOR IT.

107
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,064
I'M GOING OUT THE WINDOW.

108
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,366
NO, NO, DON'T.

109
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,768
PLEASE, I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR, LIKE, FOREVER

110
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,969
TO GO OUT WITH LORRAINE.

111
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,170
JUST CALM DOWN.

112
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,372
CALM DOWN? CALM DOWN?

113
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,174
YOU SET ME UP WITH A WOMAN I DUMPED TWICE

114
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,776
IN THE LAST FIVE MONTHS!

115
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,178
HEY, CAN YOU STOP YELLING?

116
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,581
YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS AND...

117
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,186
I CAN'T GO WHEN I'M NERVOUS.

118
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,989
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY. YOU'RE RIGHT.

119
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,595
COME ON! DO IT! DO IT!

120
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,196
GO! COME ON!

121
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,699
OKAY, OKAY, ROGER WAS CREEPY

122
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,500
BUT HE WAS NOTHING

123
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,101
COMPARED TO PETE CARNEY.

124
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,703
WHICH ONE WAS PETE CARNEY?

125
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:04,704
PETE THE WEEPER?

126
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,106
REMEMBER THE GUY THAT USED TO CRY

127
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,108
EVERY TIME WE HAD SEX?

128
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,511
"WAS IT GOOD FOR YOU?"

129
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,015
YEAH, WELL, I'D TAKE A LITTLE CRYING ANY DAY

130
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,017
OVER HOWARD THE "I WIN" GUY.

131
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,019
"I WIN! I WIN!"

132
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,220
I WENT OUT

133
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,222
WITH THE GUY FOR TWO MONTHS.

134
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,824
I DIDN'T GET TO WIN ONCE.

135
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,226
HOW DO WE END UP WITH THESE JERKS?

136
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,428
WE'RE GOOD PEOPLE.

137
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,629
I DON'T KNOW.

138
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,031
MAYBE WE'RE LIKE SOME KIND OF MAGNETS.

139
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,232
I KNOW I AM.

140
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:36,035
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T WEAR A DIGITAL WATCH.

141
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,440
THERE'S MORE BEER, RIGHT?

142
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:46,346
OH! YOU KNOW MY FRIEND ABBY WHO SHAVES HER HEAD?

143
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,947
NO.

144
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:51,150
OKAY, WELL, I HAVE THIS FRIEND ABBY WHO SHAVES HER HEAD

145
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,152
BUT SHE SAYS THAT IF YOU WANT TO BREAK

146
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,754
THE BAD BOYFRIEND CYCLE

147
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,156
YOU CAN DO, LIKE, A CLEANSING RITUAL.

148
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:04,063
PHEEBS, THIS WOMAN IS VOLUNTARILY BALD.

149
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,366
YEAH. SO...

150
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,568
WE CAN DO IT TOMORROW NIGHT, GUYS.

151
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,370
IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY.

152
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,571
IT'S PERFECT.

153
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,173
OKAY. WELL, WHAT KIND OF RITUAL?

154
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:18,878
OKAY. WE CAN BURN THE STUFF THEY GAVE US.

155
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,080
OR...

156
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,484
OR... OR WE CAN CHANT AND DANCE AROUND NAKED.

157
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,085
YOU KNOW, WITH STICKS.

158
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,289
BURNING'S GOOD. BURNING'S GOOD.

159
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,291
I GOT STUFF TO BURN.

160
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,301
YOU KNOW...

161
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,703
EVER SINCE I WAS LITTLE

162
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,705
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO PICK UP QUARTERS

163
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:46,906
WITH MY TOES.

164
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:48,107
YEAH?

165
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,709
GOOD FOR YOU.

166
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:55,715
UH... QUARTERS OR ROLLS OF QUARTERS?

167
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,723
BY THE WAY, CHANDLER...

168
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,725
I CUT YOU OUT OF ALL MY PICTURES

169
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,928
SO IF YOU WANT, I HAVE A BAG WITH JUST YOUR HEADS.

170
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,331
THAT'S OKAY.

171
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,332
ARE YOU SURE? REALLY?

172
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:16,936
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD MAKE LITTLE PUPPETS OUT OF THEM

173
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,139
AND YOU COULD USE THEM IN YOUR THEATER OF CRUELTY.

174
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,944
WE CAN'T DO THAT.

175
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,647
WHAT? WHAT CAN'T YOU DO?

176
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,251
UH... CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND OVER THERE?

177
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:42,261
UH... WE MIGHT BE LEAVING NOW.

178
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,964
TELL ME IT'S "YOU AND ME" WE.

179
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,968
SHE SAID SHE WANTS TO SLATHER MY BODY WITH STUFF

180
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,570
AND THEN LICK IT OFF.

181
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,372
I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHAT SLATHERING IS.

182
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:57,376
BUT I DEFINITELY WANT TO BE A PART OF IT.

183
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:01,380
OKAY, YOU CANNOT DO THIS TO ME.

184
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,182
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY.

185
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,383
YOU'RE RIGHT.

186
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:09,489
CAN WE HAVE THREE CHOCOLATE MOUSSES TO GO, PLEASE?

187
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,790
I'M OUT OF HERE.

188
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,391
LOOK...

189
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,993
HERE'S MY CREDIT CARD.

190
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:14,794
DINNER'S ON ME.

191
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,395
I'M SORRY, CHANDLER.

192
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,397
I HOPE SHE THROWS UP ON YOU.

193
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,401
THANKS.

194
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:25,605
SO...

195
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,607
JUST US.

196
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,309
OH, WHAT A CRAPPY NIGHT.

197
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,211
ALTHOUGH... I HAVE ENJOYED THE FACT

198
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,213
THAT YOUR SHIRT'S BEEN STICKING OUT

199
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,616
OF YOUR ZIPPER EVER SINCE YOU CAME BACK

200
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,817
FROM THE BATHROOM.

201
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:38,918

202
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:43,923
EXCUSE ME.

203
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,128
HOW YOU DOING?

204
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,434
SO...

205
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,837
DO WE HAVE THE BEST FRIENDS OR WHAT?

206
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,338
JOEY'S NOT A FRIEND.

207
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:02,141
HE'S...

208
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,745
A STUPID MAN WHO LEFT US HIS CREDIT CARD.

209
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:10,650
ANOTHER DRINK? SOME DESSERT? A BIG SCREEN TV?

210
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,652
I WILL GO FOR THAT DRINK.

211
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:13,753
YOU GOT IT.

212
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,254
GOOD WOMAN?

213
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,059
COULD WE GET A BOTTLE

214
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,461
OF YOUR MOST OVERPRICED CHAMPAGNE?

215
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,362
EACH.

216
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,764
THAT'S RIGHT, EACH.

217
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,365
OH, AND A ROB ROY.

218
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,168
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW.

219
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:51,591
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY.

220
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:03,102
OH, I MISS YOU ALREADY.

221
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,204
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED?

222
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,405
NO... NO!

223
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,808
AND YET IT DID.

224
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,210
GOOD BYE, JANICE.

225
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,411
KISS ME.

226
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,917
OH, CHANDLER, SORRY.

227
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:21,921
OH, CHANDLER, SORRY...

228
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,522
HEY, JANICE.

229
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,024
HI, MONICA.

230
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,426
OKAY, WELL, THIS WAS VERY SPECIAL.

231
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:32,231
RACH, COME SEE WHO'S OUT HERE.

232
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:33,332
WHAT'S GOING...

233
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,334
OH, MY GOD.

234
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,936
JANICE, HI.

235
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,137
HI.

236
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,140
JANICE IS GOING TO GO AWAY NOW.

237
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,643
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

238
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,844
OH...

239
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:48,047
JOEY, LOOK WHO IT IS.

240
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,449
WHOA.

241
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,953
OH, GOOD, JOEY'S HOME NOW.

242
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,555
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.

243
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,558
THIS IS LIKE A REUNION IN THE HALL.

244
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,560

245
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,361
OH, HI, ROSS. YEAH.

246
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,764
THERE'S SOMEONE I WANT YOU TO SAY HI TO.

247
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,868
HE JUST HAPPENED TO CALL.

248
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:09,669
HELLO, ROSS.

249
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,870
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

250
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,071
IT'S ME.

251
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,272
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

252
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,081

253
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,590
I'M JUST SAYING IF DOGS DO EXPERIENCE JET LAG

254
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,592
THEN BECAUSE OF THE WHOLE

255
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,796
"SEVEN DOG YEARS TO ONE HUMAN YEAR" THING

256
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,999
THAT WHEN A DOG FLIES FROM NEW YORK TO LOS ANGELES

257
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,401
HE DOESN'T JUST LOSE THREE HOURS

258
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:45,204
HE LOSES, LIKE, A WEEK AND A HALF.

259
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,508
THAT'S FUNNY.

260
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,710
YEAH.

261
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:01,120
YOU KNOW, THEY SHOULD BE COOKING THE FOOD SOON.

262
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,122
OH, GOOD.

263
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:09,829
WHAT?

264
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,533
WHO ARE THEY?

265
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,336
THE BLONDE IS MY EX WIFE

266
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,938
AND THE WOMAN

267
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,239
TOUCHING HER IS HER

268
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,042
CLOSE, PERSONAL FRIEND.

269
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,245
YOU MEAN THEY'RE LOVERS?

270
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,448
IF YOU WANT TO PUT A LABEL ON IT.

271
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,450
WOW...

272
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,853
UH, ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD KNOW?

273
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,855
NOPE, NOPE. THAT'S IT.

274
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,358
OH, AND SHE'S PREGNANT WITH MY BABY.

275
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,964
I ALWAYS FORGET THAT PART.

276
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,769
HELLOOO...

277
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,777
 OKAY, SO NOW WE NEED SAGE BRANCHES

278
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,779
AND THE SACRAMENTAL WINE.

279
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,583
ALL I HAD IS OREGANO AND A FRESCA.

280
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,585
UM... THAT'S OKAY.

281
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,787
OKAY.

282
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,189
OOH...

283
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,390
OKAY.

284
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,591
ALL RIGHT.

285
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,994
NOW WE NEED THE SEMEN OF A RIGHTEOUS MAN.

286
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,401
OKAY, PHEEBS, YOU KNOW WHAT?

287
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,204
IF WE HAD THAT, WE WOULDN'T BE DOING THE RITUAL

288
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:26,906
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

289
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,908
CAN WE JUST START THROWING THINGS IN?

290
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,109
YEAH, OKAY.

291
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,310
OH.

292
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,312
OKAY.

293
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,714
OKAY, BARRY'S LETTERS.

294
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,918
ADAM RITTER'S BOXER SHORTS.

295
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:39,718
OH, AND I HAVE

296
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,821
THE RECEIPT FROM MY DINNER WITH

297
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,223
NOKULULE OON  AH.

298
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,329
HERE'S A PICTURE OF SCOTTY JARED NAKED.

299
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,530
OH, LET ME SEE.

300
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,132
HE'S WEARING A SWEATER.

301
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,333
NO.

302
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,534
EWW! EWW!

303
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,540
OH, WAIT-- WHO'S M.C.I. CARD IS THAT?

304
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,142
MINE. OH, SHOOT.

305
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,544
OKAY, REMEMBER THIS NUMBER: 9743...

306
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:09,148
OH... OH, WELL.

307
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,351
OKAY, AND HERE WE HAVE THE LAST OF PAOLO'S GRAPPA.

308
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,152
WAIT, RACHEL.

309
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,154
ISN'T THAT ALMOST PURE--

310
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,055

311
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:23,262
HOW CAN I DUMP THIS WOMAN ON VALENTINE'S DAY?

312
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,563
I DON'T KNOW.

313
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,165
YOU DUMPED HER ON NEW YEAR'S.

314
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,368
OH, MAN.

315
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,571
IN MY NEXT LIFE, I'M COMING BACK AS A TOILET BRUSH.

316
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,675
HELLO, FUNNY VALENTINE.

317
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,378
HI, JUST JANICE.

318
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,181
HELLO, JOEY

319
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,382
OUR LITTLE MATCHMAKER.

320
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,986
I COULD JUST KISS YOU ALL OVER AND I'M GONNA.

321
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,492
IF YOU DON'T DO IT, I WILL.

322
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,111
SO, UH...

323
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,712

324
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,515
SO, ARE YOU ACTUALLY FROM NEW YORK?

325
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,918
NO, NOT ORIGINALLY. I'M FROM...

326
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:19,818
 OH, GOD!

327
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,020
OH, NO. I THOUGHT YOU SAID

328
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,621
THEY COULD SHOOT THE SPOT WITHOUT YOU.

329
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,623
I THOUGHT THEY COULD.

330
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:27,026
I MEAN, THE MAXI PADS WERE A PIECE OF CAKE.

331
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:30,229
YOU'D THINK THE MINI PADS WOULD BE THAT MUCH EASIER.

332
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,231
BUT IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY.

333
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,533
I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT IT'S MY JOB. FINE.

334
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,336
LOOK, I'LL TRY TO GET BACK AS SOON AS I CAN.

335
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,537
I'M SORRY.

336
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:39,738
 WELL, ACTUALLY

337
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,141
I'M SPENDING MOST OF MY TIME TEACHING SCIENCE

338
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,342
WHICH IS FUNNY

339
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,944
BECAUSE THAT WASN'T EVEN MY MAJOR.

340
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,158
NOW, THAT IS FUNNY.

341
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,462
HEY, DO YOU THINK...

342
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,064
WOULD IT BE TOO WEIRD

343
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,866
IF I INVITED CAROL OVER TO JOIN US?

344
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,669
BECAUSE SHE'S, SHE'S... SHE'S ALONE NOW

345
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,671
AND AND PREGNANT AND AND SAD.

346
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,273
I GUESS.

347
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,074
ARE YOU SURE?

348
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,675
THANKS.

349
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,478
CAROL, WANT TO COME OVER AND JOIN US?

350
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,879
OH, NO, NO. I'M FINE, I'M FINE.

351
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,182
COME ON. THESE PEOPLE WILL SCOOCH DOWN.

352
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,083
COME ON.

353
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,284
COME ON, WILL YOU?

354
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,086
YOU GUYS WILL SCOOCH, WON'T YOU?

355
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,687
LET'S TRY SCOOCHING.

356
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,990
COME ON.

357
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,191
COME ON.

358
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,392
THANK YOU.

359
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:38,197
UH, KRISTEN RIGGS, THIS... THIS IS CAROL WILLICK.

360
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:39,798
CAROL, KRISTEN.

361
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,000
HOW DO YOU DO?

362
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,402
UM, OH, UH, CAROL TEACHES SIXTH GRADE.

363
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:47,806
AND, UH, KRISTEN...

364
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:54,613
KRISTEN DOES SOMETHING THAT, FUNNILY ENOUGH

365
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:58,617
WASN'T EVEN HER MAJOR.

366
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,923
THANKS, YOU GUYS, FOR COMING OVER.

367
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,925
NOT AT ALL. IT'S PRETTY MUCH OUR JOB.

368
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:08,927
THAT'S WHY WE GET THE COOL HATS.

369
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,730
WHAT DO WE GOT THERE?

370
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,033
PIECE OF SILK... BOXER SHORTS...

371
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,335
SOME GREETING CARDS...

372
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:19,438
LOOKS LIKE A HALF CHARRED PICTURE...

373
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,241
WOW, THAT GUY'S HAIRIER THAN THE CHIEF.

374
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,947
YOU KNOW, IT'S A REALLY FUNNY STORY

375
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,549
HOW THIS HAPPENED.

376
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,752
WELL, YOU SEE, I WAS TAKING OUT THE TRASH

377
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,155
AND PHOEBE WAS LIGHTING INCENSE...

378
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,856
IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

379
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,058
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

380
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,060
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST BOYFRIEND BONFIRE

381
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,062
THAT WE'VE SEEN GET OUT OF CONTROL.

382
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,064
YOU'RE OUR THIRD CALL TONIGHT.

383
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,265
REALLY?

384
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:49,068
OH, SURE. VALENTINE'S OUR BUSIEST NIGHT

385
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,370
OF THE YEAR.

386
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,671
LOOK, LADIES, IN THE FUTURE

387
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,673
WHEN YOU'RE BURNING YOUR EX BOYFRIEND'S STUFF

388
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,275
NUMBER ONE: MAKE SURE

389
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,876
YOU'RE IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA.

390
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,679
NUMBER TWO: IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE BURNING HIS CLOTHING

391
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,281
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO STAY AWAY

392
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,882
FROM YOUR SYNTHETIC FABRICS.

393
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,484
NUMBER THREE: TRY TO LET GO

394
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,886
OF THE ANGER AND LEARN TO LOVE YOURSELF.

395
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,392
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING.

396
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,394
IS IT LOADED?

397
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,800
OH, LITTLE CANDY HEARTS.

398
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,804
"CHAN AND JAN FOREVER."

399
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:28,207
I HAD THEM MADE SPECIAL.

400
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,713
OKAY, JANICE.

401
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:35,514
JANICE...

402
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,317
HEY, JANICE.

403
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,122
LOOK, THERE'S NO WAY FOR ME TO TELL YOU THIS.

404
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,524
AT LEAST, THERE'S NO NEWWAY FOR ME

405
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,725
TO TELL YOU THIS.

406
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,731
I JUST DON'T THINK THINGS ARE GOING TO WORK OUT.

407
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,735
THAT'S FINE.

408
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:00,739
IT IS?

409
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,341
MM HMM.

410
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,944
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THIS ISN'T THE END.

411
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:10,349
OH, NO, YOU SEE, ACTUALLY IT IS.

412
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,550
NO, IT ISN'T

413
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,552
BECAUSE YOU WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

414
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,554
DON'T YOU KNOW IT YET?

415
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,757
YOU LOVE ME, CHANDLER BING.

416
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,763
OH, NO, I DON'T.

417
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,365
WELL, THEN, ASK YOURSELF THIS:

418
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,767
WHY DO YOU THINK WE KEEP ENDING UP TOGETHER?

419
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,369
NEW YEAR'S-- WHO INVITED WHO?

420
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,371
VALENTINE'S-- WHO ASKED WHO INTO WHOSE BED?

421
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,373
I DID, BUT...

422
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,574
YOU SEEK ME OUT.

423
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:41,180
SOMETHING DEEP IN YOUR SOUL CALLS OUT TO ME LIKE A FOGHORN.

424
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,184
JAN ICE, JAN ICE.

425
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,586
AND THEN YOU PUSH ME AWAY, YOU PULL ME BACK.

426
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,689
JAN ICE.

427
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,890
YOU WANT ME.

428
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,091
YOU NEED ME.

429
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,894
YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT ME

430
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,496
AND YOU KNOW IT.

431
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:01,099
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW IT.

432
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,105
SEE YA.

433
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,614
CALL ME.

434
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:27,426
NOT TRUE. I NEVER CALLED YOUR MOTHER A WOLVERINE.

435
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,027
YOU DID SO.

436
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,029
I SWEAR, I SWEAR TO...

437
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,236
HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN IN THE BATHROOM?

438
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,339
UH, I DON'T THINK SHE'S IN THE BATHROOM.

439
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,540
HER COAT IS GONE.

440
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,543
WELL, MAYBE IT'S COLD IN THERE.

441
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,144
OH...

442
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,346
MAYBE I SCREWED UP

443
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,348
THE FIRST DATE I HAD IN NINE YEARS.

444
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,549
THAT COULD BE IT.

445
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,150
OH, GOD.

446
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,354
YOU KNOW, THIS IS STILL PRETTY HOT.

447
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,360
MUSHROOM.

448
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,162
OH, SMILE.

449
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,565
THEY WON'T ALL BE LIKE THIS.

450
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,967
SOME WOMEN MIGHT EVEN STAY THROUGH DINNER.

451
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,969
I'M SORRY. THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

452
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,571
IT'S JUST...

453
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,172
WELL, YOU KNOW THE WHOLE

454
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,975
"GETTING ON WITH YOUR LIFE" THING?

455
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,977
WELL, DO I HAVE TO?

456
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:23,382
I MEAN, I'M SITTING HERE WITH THIS CUTE WOMAN

457
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,184
AND, AND, AND SHE'S PERFECTLY NICE, YOU KNOW?

458
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,786
AND, BUT THAT THERE'S...

459
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,889
THAT'S IT.

460
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:34,493
AND, UM, AND THEN I'M HERE TALKING TO YOU

461
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:39,698
AND IT'S EASY, AND IT'S FUN AND I DON'T HAVE TO...

462
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:40,899
I KNOW.

463
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,301
YOU KNOW?

464
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,906
HERE'S A WACKY THOUGHT:

465
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:51,510
WHAT SAY YOU AND I GIVE IT ANOTHER SHOT?

466
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,111
ROSS...

467
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,514
NO, NO, NO. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY.

468
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,516
YOU'RE A LESBIAN.

469
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:58,717
BUT LET'S...

470
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:02,721
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE JUST PUT THAT ASIDE FOR NOW, YOU KNOW?

471
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,524
LET'S JUST STICK A PIN IN IT, OKAY?

472
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,327
BECAUSE WE'RE GREAT TOGETHER.

473
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,329
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T DENY IT.

474
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,731
AND BESIDES

475
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:17,135
I'VE GOT A RING AT HOME THAT FITS YOU.

476
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,538
UH... I'VE GOT, UH, LOTS OF PICTURES

477
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,139
WITH BOTH OF US IN THEM, OKAY?

478
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,141
AND AND, BEST OF ALL... HEY, HEY--

479
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,743
YOU'RE CARRYING MY BABY.

480
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,145
I MEAN, HOW PERFECT IS THAT?

481
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,347
ROSS...

482
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,649
NOW, SEE, YOU KNOW, YOU KEEP SAYING THAT

483
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,651
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING RIGHT HERE.

484
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,653
I LOVE YOU.

485
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,762
OH, I LOVE YOU, TOO.

486
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:44,563
BUT...

487
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,866
NO BUT, NO BUT.

488
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,268
YOU KNOW THAT THING WE PUT OVER HERE

489
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:51,470
WITH THE PIN IN IT?

490
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,874
IT'S TIME TO TAKE THE PIN OUT.

491
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,681
YEAH.

492
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,683
YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE, I KNOW YOU WILL.

493
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:07,085
THE RIGHT WOMAN IS JUST WAITING FOR YOU.

494
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,087
THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

495
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:11,890
YOU FOUND ONE ALREADY.

496
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,192
ALL YOU NEED IS A WOMAN WHO LIKES MEN

497
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,794
AND YOU'LL BE SET.

498
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,499
NOT HER.

500
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:37,015
SO YOU GUYS REALLY JUST SLIDE DOWN A POLE, HUH?

501
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,019
ABSOLUTELY.

502
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,523
THAT'S SO COOL.

503
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,925
AND HOW DO YOU GET BACK UP?

504
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:53,331
WELL, WE RARELY HAVE TO RETURN FROM A FIRE AS QUICKLY.

505
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,537
UM, SO, UH, WOULD YOU GUYS, UH...

506
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,539
WELL, WOULD YOU LIKE TO, UH...

507
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,142
SOMETIME MAYBE, UH, MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO...?

508
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,144
GO FOR A DRINK SOMETIME?

509
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,746
SURE, DRINK SOUNDS GOOD.

510
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:08,947
YEAH. WE GOT TO GO NOW

511
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:10,949
BUT WE GET OFF AROUND MIDNIGHT.

512
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,551
WHY DON'T WE PICK YOU UP THEN.

513
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,553
OKAY, GREAT.

514
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:17,255
SO, UM, WILL YOU BRING THE TRUCK?

515
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,660
I'LL EVEN LET YOU RING THE BELL.

516
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,861
WHOO HOO!

517
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,062
WE'LL SEE YOU LATER. BYE.

518
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,664
BYE. I CAN'T WAIT.

519
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:26,865
SEE YOU LATER.

520
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,066
OKAY, SEE YOU.

521
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,267
OH, MY GOD.

522
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:31,670
SEE, THERE YOU GO.

523
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,271
THE CLEANSING WORKED.

524
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:34,473
YOU'RE RIGHT.

525
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,475
THEY'RE NICE GUYS.

526
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,178
THEY'RE FIREMEN GUYS.

527
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,180
YOU GUYS TELL THEM YOU WERE MARRIED?

528
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:42,981
NO WAY. YOU KIDDING?

529
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,182
MY GIRLFRIEND DOESN'T KNOW.

530
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:45,684
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL THEM.
