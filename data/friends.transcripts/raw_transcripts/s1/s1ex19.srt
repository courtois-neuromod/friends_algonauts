00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,287
OH. RIGHT.

00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,090

00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,014
LUCKY.

41
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,618
TO HAVE HAD A FRIEND LIKE YOU.

42
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:03,123
AND NOW IT'S QUIET TIME.

43
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,724
SHH! SHH! SHH! SHH!

00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,130
MARCEL, BRING ME THE RICE.

00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:12,932

00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,735
THANK YOU. GOOD BOY.

49
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,538
I SEE HE'S FINALLY MASTERED THE DIFFERENCE

50
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,741
BETWEEN "BRING ME THE..." AND "PEE IN THE..."

51
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,944
"BRING ME THE..." AND...

52
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,546
RACH.

53
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:27,747
WHAT?

54
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:28,448
HI.

55
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,649
OH. I'M SORRY.

56
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,051
OH, THIS IS SO STUPID.

57
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,454
I MEAN, I GAVE BARRY UP, RIGHT?

58
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:35,655
MMM.

59
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,657
I SHOULD BE HAPPY FOR THEM.

60
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,659
I AM. I'M HAPPY FOR THEM.

61
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,460
REALLY?

62
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,561
NO.

63
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:42,762
OH.

64
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,764
OH, I GUESS IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT

65
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,766
IF I WERE WITH SOMEBODY.

66
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,468
WHOA. WHAT, UH...?

67
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,671
WHAT HAPPENED TO, UH... "FORGET RELATIONSHIPS"?

68
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,273
"I'M DONE WITH MEN"?

69
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,675
THE WHOLE, UH, PENIS EMBARGO?

70
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,880
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

71
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,683
I GUESS IT'S... IT'S NOT ABOUT NO GUYS.

72
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,085
IT'S ABOUT THE RIGHT GUY, YOU KNOW?

73
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,087
I MEAN, WITH BARRY

74
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,890
IT WAS SAFE AND IT WAS EASY, BUT THERE WAS NO HEAT.

75
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,793
YOU KNOW, WITH PAOLO, THAT'S ALL THERE WAS

76
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:14,994
WAS HEAT.

77
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,697
IT WAS JUST THIS RAW, ANIMAL, SEXUAL...

78
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,699
RIGHT, RIGHT. I GOT IT.

79
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,301
I WAS THERE.

80
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,502
WELL, I MEAN

81
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,904
DO YOU THINK IT CAN EVER HAVE BOTH?

82
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,707
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE WHO'S, LIKE, YOUR BEST FRIEND

83
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,709
BUT THEN ALSO CAN MAKE YOUR TOES CURL?

84
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,311
YES, YES.

85
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,912
YES, YES, I DO.

86
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,514
I REALLY DO.

87
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,516
UH, IN FACT, IT'S FUNNY.

88
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,319
VERY OFTEN SOMEONE WHO YOU WOULDN'T THINK

89
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,820
COULD, COULD...

90
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,422
CURL YOUR TOES

91
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,625
MIGHT JUST BE THE ONE WHO, UH... WHO...

92
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,227
HI.

93
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,428
GETS INTERRUPTED. HI.

94
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,630
HEY, GUYS, HOW WAS THE MOVIE?

95
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,232
WONDERFUL. SO GOOD.

96
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,733
SUCK FEST.

97
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,335
TOTAL CHICK FLICK.

98
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,239
I'M SORRY IT WASN'T ONE OF THOSE MOVIES

99
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,041
WITH, LIKE, YOU KNOW, LIKE, GUNS AND BOMBS

100
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,344
AND, LIKE, BUSES GOING REALLY FAST.

101
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,148
HEY, I DON'T NEED VIOLENCE TO ENJOY A MOVIE

102
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,551
JUST SO LONG AS THERE'S A LITTLE NUDITY.

103
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,553
THERE WAS NUDITY.

104
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,054
I MEANT FEMALE NUDITY.

105
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,058
I DON'T NEED TO SEE LOU GRANT FROLICKING.

106
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,460
HUGH. HUGH.

107
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,061
HUGH GRANT. HUGH GRANT.

108
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,665
ALL RIGHT, I'VE GOT TO GO.

109
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,667
COME ON, MARCEL. COME ON.

110
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,469
WE'RE GOING TO GO TAKE A BATH.

111
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,471
YES, WE ARE, AREN'T WE? YES, WE ARE.

112
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,873
THEY'RE STILL JUST FRIENDS, RIGHT?

113
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,078
AND I WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

114
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,680
THAT'S RIGHT.

115
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,881
YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND TOMORROW

116
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,883
AT AUNT RACHEL'S, AREN'T YOU, HUH?

117
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:44,884
HANG ON, HANG ON.

118
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,886
DOES AUNT MONICA GET A SAY IN THIS?

119
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,288
PLEASE, AUNT MONICA?

120
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,889
PLEASE?

121
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,191
OH, UNCLENCH. YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING

122
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,593
TO BE HERE.

123
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,299
YOU KNOW, I CANNOT BELIEVE

124
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,701
WE ARE EVEN HAVING THIS DISCUSSION.

125
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,703
I AGREE. I'M, LIKE, IN DISBELIEF.

126
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:04,904
I MEAN, DON'T YOU THINK

127
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,307
IF THINGS WERE GOING TO HAPPEN WITH RACHEL

128
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,908
THEY WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ALREADY?

129
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,911
I'M TELLING YOU, SHE SAID SHE'S LOOKING FOR A RELATIONSHIP

130
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,513
WITH SOMEONE EXACTLY LIKE ME.

131
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,014
SHE REALLY SAID THAT?

132
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:18,017
WELL, I ADDED THE "EXACTLY LIKE ME" PART.

133
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,020
BUT SHE SAID SHE'S LOOKING FOR SOMEONE

134
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,423
AND SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE THERE TONIGHT.

135
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,924
TONIGHT TONIGHT?

136
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,826
WELL, I THINK IT'S PERFECT, YOU KNOW?

137
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,828
IT'S JUST GOING TO BE THE TWO OF US.

138
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,031
SHE SPENT ALL DAY TAKING CARE OF MY MONKEY.

139
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,033
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME

140
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,936
I GOT A GIRL TO TAKE CARE OF MY MONKEY.

141
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,943
ANYWAY, I FIGURED AFTER WORK

142
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,646
I'D GO PICK UP A BOTTLE OF WINE

143
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,849
GO OVER THERE AND TRY TO WOO HER.

144
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:50,850
HEY, YOU KNOW

145
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,452
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?

146
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,854
YOU SHOULD TAKE HER BACK TO THE 1890s

147
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,856
WHEN THAT PHRASE WAS LAST USED.

148
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,061
She keeps this up, honey,

149
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,464
I swear you'll be finished with this sucker

150
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,264
by the end of the week

151
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,167
NOW, NOW THE ONE IN THE FEATHER BOA...

152
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,769
THAT'S DR. FRANCIS.

153
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,771
NOW SHE USED TO BE A MAN.

154
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,373
OKAY? OH, LOOK. SEE, NOW THERE'S RAVEN

155
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,274
AND WE HATE HER.

156
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,877
WE'RE GLAD SHE'S DYING AND THAT...

157
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,680
MARCEL, ARE YOU PLAYING WITH MONICA'S SHOES?

158
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,483
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO PLAY...

159
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,885
WHOA. WHOA.

160
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:29,889
MARCEL, DID YOU POO IN THE SHOE?

161
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,192
OH, MARCEL, BAD MONKEY.

162
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,794
OH, GOSH.

163
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:35,995
OH.

164
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,597
OH.

165
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,601
SORRY, BARRY.

166
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,404
LITTLE ENGAGEMENT GIFT.

167
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,806
I'M SURE YOU DIDN'T REGISTER FOR THAT.

168
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,514

169
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,616
WHO DIED? WHO DIED?

170
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,618
ROLL HIM OVER.

171
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,620
OH, COME ON, ROLL HIM OVER.

172
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,121
OH. WELL...

173
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,524
WE KNOW IT WASN'T DEXTER, RIGHT, MARCEL?

174
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,125
BECAUSE...

175
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,326
MARCEL?

176
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,228
MARCEL? MAR...

177
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,031
HOW COULD YOU LOSE HIM?

178
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,633
I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

179
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:14,434
WE WERE WATCHING TV

180
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,035
AND THEN HE POOPED IN MONICA'S SHOE...

181
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,236
WAIT...

182
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,439
HE POOPED IN MY SHOE?

183
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,239
WHICH ONE?

184
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,441
I DON'T KNOW.

185
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,443
THE LEFT ONE.

186
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,644
WHICH ONES?

187
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,847
OH. THOSE LITTLE CLUNKY AMISH THINGS YOU THINK

188
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,849
GO WITH EVERYTHING.

189
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:30,950
HEY. HEY. HEY.

190
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,151
WHOA. OH.

191
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,554
WHY IS THE AIR IN HERE SO NEGATIVE?

192
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,658
RACHEL LOST MARCEL.

193
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:39,759
OH, NO. HOW?

194
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,960
HE POOPED IN MY SHOE.

195
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,161
WHICH ONE?

196
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,564
THOSE CUTE BLACK ONES I WEAR ALL THE TIME.

197
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,566
NO. WHICH ONE?

198
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,167
THE RIGHT OR LEFT?

199
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,371
BECAUSE THE LEFT ONE IS LUCKY.

200
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,974
COME ON, YOU GUYS, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

201
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,175
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

202
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,777
ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE A MONKEY.

203
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,378
YOU'RE LOOSE IN THE CITY.

204
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,179
WHERE DO YOU GO?

205
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,181
OKAY, IT'S HIS FIRST TIME OUT

206
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,584
SO HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO WANT TO DO

207
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,986
SOME OF THE TOURISTY THINGS.

208
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,588
I'LL GO TO CATS.

209
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,390
YOU GO TO THE RUSSIAN TEA ROOM.

210
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,592
OH, MY GOD.

211
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:13,793
COME ON.

212
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,795
HE'S GOING TO BE HOME ANY MINUTE.

213
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,497
HE'S GOING TO KILL ME.

214
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,698
OKAY, WE'LL START WITH THE BUILDING.

215
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,299
YOU GUYS TAKE THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOOR.

216
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,901
PHOEBE AND I'LL TAKE THIRD AND FOURTH.

217
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,603
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

218
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,403
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

219
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,005
OKAY, YOU STAY HERE, JUST WAIT BY THE PHONE

220
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,708
SPRAY LYSOL IN MY SHOE AND WAIT FOR ROSS TO KILL YOU.

221
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,910
DOES ANYBODY WANT TO TRADE?

222
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,512
OH...

223
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,720
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

224
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,522
MR. HECKLES, OUR FRIEND LOST A MONKEY.

225
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,723
HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

226
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,725
I LEFT A BELGIAN WAFFLE OUT HERE.

227
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,326
DID YOU TAKE IT?

228
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,528
NO.

229
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,930
WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE YOUR BELGIAN WAFFLE IN THE HALL?

230
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,932
I WASN'T READY FOR IT.

231
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,334
THE MONKEY. HAVE YOU SEEN A MONKEY?

232
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:58,638
SAW REGIS PHILBIN ONCE.

233
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,040
OKAY, THANK YOU, MR. HECKLES.

234
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,843
YOU OWE ME A WAFFLE.

235
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,647
OKAY, HE'S A BLACK CAPUCHIN MONKEY

236
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,248
WITH A WHITE FACE...

237
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:13,252
WITH RUSSIAN DRESSING AND PICKLES ON THE SIDE.

238
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,055
OKAY, THANKS.

239
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,256
HI.

240
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,258
HI. HOW DID IT GO TODAY?

241
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,159
OH, GREAT!

242
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,161
IT WENT GREAT, REALLY GREAT.

243
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,362
HEY, IS THAT WINE?

244
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:24,564
YEAH, YEAH.

245
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,165
YOU WANT SOME?

246
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,366
OH, I WOULD LOVE SOME.

247
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,568
YEAH?

248
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,769
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT?

249
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:30,970
LET'S NOT DRINK IT HERE.

250
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,171
I'M FEELING KIND OF CRAZY.

251
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,372
YOU WANT TO GO TO NEWARK?

252
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,177
UH, OKAY.

253
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,779
YEAH, WE COULD DO THAT.

254
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,380
BUT BEFORE WE HEAD OFF

255
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,183
TO THE MURDER CAPITAL OF THE NORTHEAST

256
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,986
I WAS, UH... KIND OF WANTED TO RUN SOMETHING BY YOU.

257
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:50,189
YOU KNOW HOW WE WERE, YOU KNOW, TALKING BEFORE

258
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:53,292
ABOUT, UH, RELATIONSHIPS AND STUFF? WELL...

259
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,294
OH, GOD, ROSS, I CANNOT DO THIS.

260
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,096
OKAY, QUICK AND PAINFUL.

261
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,106
OH, GOD.

262
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,708
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

263
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,309
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

264
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,311
ROSS, PLEASE DON'T HATE ME.

265
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,412
OH, WHY?

266
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:14,614
WHAT? WHAT?

267
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:19,018
UH... YOU KNOW MARCEL?

268
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,620
YEAH?

269
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,823
WELL, I I KIND OF...

270
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,225
I KIND OF LOST HIM.

271
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,142
I I I... I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

272
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,144
I MEAN, ALL I ASKED YOU TO DO

273
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,246
WAS KEEP HIM IN THE APARTMENT.

274
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,447
I KNOW, I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

275
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,850
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT? I GUESS IT'S PARTIALLY MY FAULT.

276
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,252
I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED YOU TO START OFF WITH A MONKEY.

277
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,254
I SHOULD HAVE STARTED YOU OFF WITH LIKE A PEN OR A PENCIL.

278
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,057
ROSS, I'M DOING EVERYTHING THAT I CAN.

279
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,860
I'VE GOT EVERYBODY LOOKING FOR HIM AND I...

280
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,461

281
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,663
OH!

282
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,864
WHO IS IT?

283
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,065
 Animal Control.

284
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,067
SEE, I'VE EVEN GOT ANIMAL CONTROL.

285
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,069
YOU CALLED ANIMAL CONTROL?

286
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,470
UH HUH.

287
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,875
W WHY? DO YOU NOT LIKE THEM?

288
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:22,281
MARCEL IS AN ILLEGAL, EXOTIC ANIMAL.

289
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:27,086
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HIM IN THE CITY.

290
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:30,289
IF THEY FIND HIM, THEY'LL TAKE HIM AWAY FROM ME.

291
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,692
OH, OKAY. WELL, NOW, SEE.

292
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,694
YOU NEVER, EVER, EVER TOLD US THAT.

293
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,696
THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU

294
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,298
WERE GOING TO INVITE THEM TO THE APARTMENT.

295
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,101

296
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,705
HI, THANKS FOR COMING.

297
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,707
SOMEBODY CALLED ABOUT A MONKEY?

298
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,308
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

299
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,111
THAT WAS A COMPLETE MISUNDERSTANDING.

300
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,513
WE THOUGHT WE HAD A MONKEY, BUT WE DIDN'T.

301
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,715
TURNED OUT IT WAS A HAT.

302
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,916
CAT! CAT!

303
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,217
WHAT DID I SAY?

304
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,819
HI. WE CHECKED THE THIRD AND FOURTH FLOOR

305
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:00,619
AND NO ONE'S SEEN MARCEL.

306
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:01,921
MARCEL?

307
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,222
MY UNCLE MARCEL.

308
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,824
OH, IS THAT WHO THE MONKEY'S NAMED AFTER?

309
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,726
OKAY, ARE YOU AWARE THAT POSSESSION

310
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,327
OF AN ILLEGAL EXOTIC

311
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:11,130
IS PUNISHABLE BY UP TO TWO YEARS IN PRISON

312
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,132
AND CONFISCATION OF THE ANIMAL.

313
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,134
 OH, MY GOD.

314
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,337
YOU'D PUT THAT POOR, LITTLE CREATURE IN JAIL?

315
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,845
PHEEBS, REMEMBER HOW WE TALKED ABOUT

316
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,647
SAYING THINGS QUIETLY TO YOURSELF FIRST?

317
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:31,851
YES, BUT THERE ISN'T ALWAYS TIME.

318
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,654
LOOK, I'M SURE THERE IS SOME FRIENDLY WAY

319
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:36,856
TO RECONCILE THIS.

320
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,457
HAVE A SEAT.

321
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,260
FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVEN'T BEEN INTRODUCED.

322
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,461
I'M MONICA GELLER.

323
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,764
OH, MY GOD! YOU ARE!

324
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,166
AND YOU'RE RACHEL GREEN!

325
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,367
YEAH.

326
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,969
LOUISA GIANETTI.

327
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,570
LINCOLN HIGH?

328
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,673
I SAT BEHIND YOU GUYS IN HOMEROOM.

329
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,476
OH! LOUISA!

330
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,078
OH, MY GOD!

331
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,380
MONICA, IT'S LOUISA!

332
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,184
HEY, I WENT THERE, TOO.

333
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,686
OH, LOUISA FROM HOMEROOM!

334
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:08,687
YES.

335
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:09,889
YOU HAVE NO IDEA

336
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,490
WHO I AM, DO YOU?

337
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,892
NO. NOT AT ALL.

338
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,894
NONE.

339
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,896
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE

340
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,298
YOU SPENT FOUR YEARS IGNORING ME.

341
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,100
I MEAN, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN

342
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,502
SO HARD TO SAY, "MORNING, LOUISA"

343
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,703
OR "NICE OVERALLS"?

344
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,911
OH, I I'M SO SORRY.

345
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,113
AW, IT'S NOT SO MUCH YOU.

346
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,314
YOU WERE FAT.

347
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,716
YOU HAD YOUR OWN PROBLEMS.

348
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:38,918
BUT YOU!

349
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,519
WHAT A BITCH!

350
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:43,722
WHAT?!

351
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:44,824
YOU KNOW WHAT?

352
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,425
BE THAT AS IT MAY

353
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,627
YOU THINK YOU COULD HELP US OUT

354
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:51,430
ON THAT MONKEY THING, YOU KNOW, JUST FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE?

355
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,032
GO, BOBCATS!

356
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:56,735
I COULD... BUT I WON'T.

357
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,939
IF I FIND THAT MONKEY, HE'S MINE.

358
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:03,742
? DUN DUN DAH! ?

359
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,545
SORRY.

360
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,851
MARCEL?

361
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,052
MARCEL?

362
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,253
MARCEL?

363
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,454
MARCEL?

364
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,657

365
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,462
HI, CAN I HELP YOU?

366
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,368
UH, WE'RE KIND OF HAVING AN EMERGENCY

367
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,770
AND WE WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

368
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:33,772
A MONKEY.

369
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,374
YES, HAVE YOU SEEN ANY?

370
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,376
NO. I HAVEN'T SEEN A MONKEY.

371
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,179
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT FIXING RADIATORS?

372
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,581
SURE. DID YOU TRY TURNING THE KNOB

373
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,782
BACK THE OTHER WAY?

374
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,384
OF COURSE.

375
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,786
OH, THEN, NO.

376
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,690
TASTE THIS DAIQUIRI.

377
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,692
IS THERE TOO MUCH RUM IN HERE?

378
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,294
JUST A SECOND.

379
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,296
HOPE YOU FIND YOUR MONKEY.

380
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,898
OH, NO! WAIT! WAIT! WAIT!

381
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,499
UM... WE MAY NOT

382
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,902
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RADIATORS PER SE

383
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,904
BUT WE DO HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF EXPERTISE

384
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,306
IN THE HEATING AND COOLING MILIEU.

385
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:13,312
UH, AREN'T WE KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING HERE?

386
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,714
YES, BUT THESE WOMEN ARE VERY HOT

387
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,516
AND THEY NEED OUR HELP.

388
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:20,719
AND THEY'RE VERY HOT.

389
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,522
WE CAN'T, ALL RIGHT?

390
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,723
UH, WE'RE SORRY.

391
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,725
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW SORRY.

392
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:29,128
BUT WE PROMISED WE'D FIND THIS MONKEY.

393
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,530
IF YOU SEE HIM, HE'S ABOUT YEA HIGH

394
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,933
AND ANSWERS TO THE NAME "MARCEL."

395
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,935
SO IF WE COULD GET PICTURES OF YOU

396
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,337
YOU'D REALLY BE HELPING US OUT.

397
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,245
OKAY, FROM NOW ON

398
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,048
YOU DON'T GET TO TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE.

399
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,249
MARCEL!

400
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,750
MARCEL!

401
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,352
Phoebe and  MARCEL?

402
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,954
MARCEL?

403
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,155
MARCEL! MARCEL?

404
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:57,356
OH, MY GOD!

405
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,557
WHAT?!

406
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,159
SOMETHING JUST BRUSHED UP

407
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,360
AGAINST MY RIGHT LEG.

408
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,561
WHAT IS IT?

409
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,762
OH, IT'S OKAY.

410
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,364
IT WAS JUST MY LEFT LEG.

411
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,867
LOOK, PHOEBE!

412
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:09,668
OH, YEAH.

413
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:10,869
OH, MARCEL.

414
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:12,071
OH, COME HERE.

415
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,272
STEP ASIDE, LADIES.

416
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,075
 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

417
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,077
JUST A SMALL TRANQUILIZER.

418
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,594
 RUN, MARCEL, RUN!

419
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,397
ARE YOU OKAY?

420
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,499
YEAH, I THINK SO.

421
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,101
I JUST... OH.

422
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,105
HUH...

423
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,007
WHOA.

424
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:48,807
OH...

425
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,309
OH, GOSH.

426
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,019
 MARCEL?

427
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,620
 MARCEL?

428
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,821
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

429
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,224
WE'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

430
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,025
HE'S GONE. HE'S JUST GONE.

431
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,226
ROSS, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

432
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,827
OH, COME ON. IT'S COLD. IT'S DARK.

433
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,429
HE DOESN'T KNOW THE VILLAGE.

434
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,831
OH... AND NOW I HAVE A BROKEN FOOT.

435
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,033
OH, MY...

436
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,236
I HAVE NO MONKEY AND A BROKEN FOOT.

437
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,837
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

438
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:21,240
ROSS, YOU KNOW, I'VE SAID "I'M SORRY" LIKE A MILLION TIMES.

439
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,041
WHAT DO YOU WANT

440
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:22,841
ME TO DO, HUH?

441
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,943
YOU WANT ME TO BREAK MY FOOT TOO? OKAY.

442
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,146
HERE, I'M GOING TO BREAK MY FOOT RIGHT NOW. OW!

443
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,148
OH! GOD! OH... MY GOD.

444
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,849
THERE, ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

445
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:35,254
YEAH, NOW THAT YOU KICKED THE SIGN, HEY...

446
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:38,457
I DON'T MISS MARCEL ANYMORE.

447
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,260
YOU KNOW, IT IS NOT LIKE I DID THIS ON PURPOSE.

448
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,561
NO, NO.

449
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,563
NO, THIS IS JUST VINTAGE RACHEL.

450
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,965
I MEAN, THINGS JUST SORT OF HAPPEN AROUND YOU.

451
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:50,569
I MEAN, YOU'RE OFF IN RACHEL- LAND, DOING YOUR RACHEL THING

452
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,971
TOTALLY OBLIVIOUS TO PEOPLE'S MONKEYS

453
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,573
OR TO PEOPLE'S FEELINGS.

454
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,774
ROSS...

455
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,376
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO HEAR IT.

456
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,577
ROSS...

457
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,678
FORGET IT, HUH?

458
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:00,379
ROSS!

459
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,081
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?

460
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,485
HEY!

461
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,686
HEY, BANANA MAN! HEY

462
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,592

463
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,194
OH, THIS IS SO INTENSE.

464
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,596
ONE SIDE OF MY BUTT IS TOTALLY ASLEEP

465
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,598
AND THE OTHER SIDE HAS NO IDEA.

466
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,602
WHAT'S WITH PHOEBE?

467
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,204
TRANQUILIZER DART.

468
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,805
OH, SURE.

469
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,409
HI. DID YOU ORDER SOME BANANAS?

470
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,610
WHAT ABOUT IT?

471
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,212
GIVE ME MY MONKEY BACK!

472
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,413
I DON'T HAVE A MONKEY.

473
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,815
THEN WHAT'S WITH ALL THE BANANAS?

474
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,417
POTASSIUM.

475
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,421
MARCEL?

476
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,123
MARCEL? OKAY, WHERE IS HE?

477
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:44,923
WHERE IS HE?

478
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,125
MARCEL, MARCEL?

479
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,427
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.

480
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,630
WHAT? WHAT?!

481
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,034
MARCEL?

482
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,036

483
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,238
MARCEL?!

484
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,741
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO HIM?

485
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,343
THAT'S MY MONKEY.

486
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,644
THAT'S PATTY.

487
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,845
PATTY THE MONKEY.

488
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,847
ARE YOU INSANE?

489
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,048
COME HERE, MARCEL, COME ON.

490
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,651
COME HERE, PATTY.

491
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,553
COME HERE, MARCEL.

492
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:15,454
COME HERE, PATTY.

493
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,755
HERE, MONKEY, HERE, MONKEY.

494
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:17,956
HERE, MONKEY.

495
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,959
GOTCHA!

496
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,061
OKAY, GIVE ME MY MONKEY BACK.

497
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,263
THAT'S MY MONKEY.

498
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,665
YOU'RE BOTH GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THIS UP WITH THE JUDGE.

499
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,066
THAT'S NOT MY MONKEY.

500
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,268
JUST THE DRESS IS MINE.

501
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,470
YOU CAN SEND IT BACK WHENEVER.

502
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,271
ALL RIGHT, I WANT MY MONKEY.

503
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,472
NO!

504
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,374
OH, COME ON, LOUISA.

505
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:36,475
SORRY, PROM QUEEN.

506
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,977
YOU HAD TO BE A BITCH IN HIGH SCHOOL.

507
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,580
YOU COULDN'T HAVE BEEN FAT.

508
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,681
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

509
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,083
OKAY, IN HIGH SCHOOL, I WAS THE PROM QUEEN

510
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,285
AND I WAS THE HOMECOMING QUEEN

511
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,486
AND THE CLASS PRESIDENT

512
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,687
AND YOU...

513
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,688
WERE ALSO THERE.

514
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,990
BUT THIS ISN'T HIGH SCHOOL ANYMORE--

515
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,592
THIS IS REAL LIFE, OKAY?

516
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,594
AND WE ARE ALL ADULTS HERE.

517
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,797
HECKLES. CAN I HAVE THIS?

518
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,799
FOR THE MOST PART.

519
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,801
LOOK, IF YOU TAKE THIS MONKEY

520
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,403
I WILL LOSE ONE OF THE MOST

521
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,004
IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN MY LIFE.

522
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,006
YOU CAN HATE ME IF YOU WANT

523
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,008
BUT PLEASE DO NOT PUNISH HIM.

524
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:13,512
COME ON, LOUISA, YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO BE THE BIGGER PERSON HERE.

525
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,513
TAKE IT!

526
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,415

527
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,618
NO.

528
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:20,719
ALL RIGHT.

529
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,721
THEN HOW ABOUT I CALL YOUR SUPERVISOR

530
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,922
AND I TELL HER

531
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,725
THAT YOU SHOT MY FRIEND IN THE ASS WITH A DART?

532
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,436
HEY, IT'LL BE NICE TO GET THIS OFF FINALLY, WON'T IT?

533
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,637
YES, IT...

534
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,440
OR WE CAN LEAVE IT ON FOR NOW, THAT'S FINE.

535
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,842
YOU KNOW, WITH THE RIGHT PAIR OF PUMPS

536
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,245
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT LITTLE OUTFIT.

537
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:52,351
LISTEN, I'M I'M SORRY I WAS SO HARD ON YOU BEFORE.

538
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,552
YOU KNOW, I JUST...

539
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,554
OH, ROSS, COME ON. NO, NO, IT WAS MY FAULT.

540
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,755
I ALMOST LOST YOUR...

541
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:00,759
NO, BUT YOU WERE THE ONE WHO GOT HIM BACK, YOU KNOW?

542
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,361
YOU... YOU YOU WERE GREAT.

543
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,467
HEY, WE STILL HAVE THAT... THAT BOTTLE OF WINE.

544
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,869
ARE YOU IN THE MOOD FOR, UH...

545
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,871
SOMETHING GRAPE?

546
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,473
SURE. THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

547
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,074
ALL RIGHT.

548
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,481
OH!

549
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,487
THE, UH, NEIGHBORS MUST BE VACUUMING.

550
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,493

551
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,696
WELL, AS LONG AS WE'RE HERE

552
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:41,300
AND, UH, NOT ON THE SUBJECT

553
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,905
UM... I WAS THINKING ABOUT, UH...

554
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:50,509
HOW MAD WE GOT AT EACH OTHER BEFORE.

555
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,710
OH...

556
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,913
AND, UH... I WAS THINKING

557
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:57,316
MAYBE IT WAS PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF HOW WE, UH...

558
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,318

559
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,519
RACHEL?

560
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,720
BARRY!

561
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,521
I CAN'T.

562
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,722
I CAN'T DO IT.

563
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,324
I CAN'T MARRY MINDY.

564
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,525
I THINK I'M STILL

565
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:07,926
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

566
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,127
OH! OH!

567
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:16,635
WE HAVE GOT TO START LOCKING THAT DOOR.

568
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,545
SHOW US!

569
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:27,746
COME ON!

570
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,348
IT WAS SUCH A LONG TIME AGO.

571
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,350
OKAY, OKAY, FINE. ALL RIGHT.

572
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,251
THIS IS ME IN THE SOUND OF MUSIC.

573
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,453
YOU SEE THE VON TRAPP KIDS?

574
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:38,056
NO. THAT'S BECAUSE I'M IN FRONT OF THEM.

575
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:40,859
WHOA, BIG NUN.

576
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,161
YEAH, I THOUGHT THAT WAS AN ALP.

577
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:46,365
WELL, HIGH SCHOOL WAS NOT MY FAVORITE TIME.

578
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,566
I DON'T KNOW.

579
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,167
I LOVED HIGH SCHOOL, YOU KNOW?

580
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,771
IT WAS JUST, LIKE, FOUR YEARS OF PARTIES AND DATING AND SEX.

581
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:55,974
WELL, I WENT TO BOARDING SCHOOL WITH 400 BOYS.

582
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,976
AND ANY SEX I HAD WOULD HAVE INVOLVED

583
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,578
A MAJOR LIFESTYLE CHOICE.

584
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:06,785
GOSH, DOESN'T IT SEEM LIKE A MILLION YEARS AGO?

585
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,387
OOH, OH, OH!

586
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,789
OH! OOH! MY BUTT CHEEK IS WAKING UP! OH!
