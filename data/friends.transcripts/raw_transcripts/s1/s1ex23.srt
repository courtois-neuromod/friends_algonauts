1
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,206
SHE'S NOT HERE YET.

2
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:08,608
SHE'S HAVING MY BABY, AND SHE'S NOT HERE.

3
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:10,210
I'M SURE EVERYTHING'S FINE.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,212
HAS HER WATER BROKEN YET?

5
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:13,013
I DON'T KNOW

6
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:14,314
BUT WHEN I SPOKE TO HER

7
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,316
SHE SAID SHE HAD ALREADY PASSED THE MUCUS PLUG.

8
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,418

9
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,022
DO WE HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT THAT?

10
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,923
JOEY, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO

11
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:25,125
WHEN YOU HAVE A BABY?

12
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,127
I'M GOING TO BE IN THE WAITING ROOM

13
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,328
HANDING OUT CIGARS.

14
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:29,929
JOEY'S MADE ARRANGEMENTS

15
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,732
TO HAVE HIS BABY IN A MOVIE FROM THE 50s.

16
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,535
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

17
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,937
SHE COULD BE GIVING BIRTH IN THE CAB.

18
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,339
OH, ROSS, RELAX.

19
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:42,142
IT'S PROBABLY ONLY, LIKE, $2 FOR THE FIRST CONTRACTION

20
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,944
AND THEN 50 CENTS EACH ADDITIONAL CONTRACTION.

21
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,346
WHAT?

22
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,548
IT'S OKAY WHEN CHANDLER DOES IT?

23
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,351
YOU HAVE TO PICK YOUR MOMENTS.

24
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,753
DID I MISS IT?

25
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:54,954
SHE'S NOT EVEN HERE YET.

26
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,556
WHAT'S WITH THE GUITAR?

27
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,259
I JUST THOUGHT WE MIGHT BE HERE FOR A WHILE.

28
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,261
YOU KNOW, THINGS MIGHT GET MUSICAL.

29
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,263
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?!

30
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,464
THE GIFT SHOP.

31
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,466
I WAS LOOKING AT STUFFED ANIMALS

32
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,068
AND SUSAN WANTED A CHUNKY.

33
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:08,868
SUSAN WANTED...

34
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,570
YOU'RE HAVING A BABY, OKAY?!

35
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,172
YOU DON'T STOP FOR CHUNKYS!

36
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,873
I USED TO HAVE THAT BUMPER STICKER.

37
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,277
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN.

51
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,227
 STOPPED FOR A CHUNKY.

52
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,428
LET IT GO, ROSS.

53
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,629
I GOT AN EXTRA ONE.

54
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:10,830
YOU WANT THIS?

55
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,332
NO.

56
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,436
HEY, HOW'S MY FAVORITE PARENTING TEAM DOING?

57
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,037
DR. FRANZBLAU, HI.

58
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,840
SO, I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE THINKING OF HAVING A BABY?

59
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,344
WELL, I SEE YOU'RE NINE MONTHS PREGNANT.

60
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:25,945
THAT'S A GOOD START.

61
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,148
HOW YOU DOING WITH YOUR CONTRACTIONS?

62
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,149
OH, I LOVE THEM.

63
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,951
EACH ONE'S LIKE A LITTLE PARTY IN MY UTERUS.

64
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,155
THEY'RE EVERY FOUR MINUTES, AND LAST 55 SECONDS.

65
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:36,356
59 SECONDS.

66
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,457
QUARTZ. HA!

67
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,959
SWISS QUARTZ. HA HA!

68
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,063
AM I ALLOWED TO DRINK ANYTHING?

69
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:47,267
JUST ICE CHIPS-- THEY'RE AT THE NURSES' STATION.

70
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,668
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

71
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,869
I'M GETTING IT!

72
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,272
HI!

73
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,074
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE SOME ICE CHIPS.

74
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:56,276
THANKS.

75
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,278
AND IF YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE

76
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,078
I...

77
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,181
DO NOT BELIEVE WE HAVE MET.

78
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,582
HI.

79
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,184
I'M RACHEL GREEN.

80
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,787
I'M CAROL'S EX HUSBAND'S SISTER'S ROOMMATE.

81
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,389
IT IS NICE TO MEET YOU.

82
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,590
I'M DR. FRANZBLAU.

83
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,194
I'M YOUR ROOMMATE'S BROTHER'S EX WIFE'S OBSTETRICIAN.

84
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,997
OH... THAT'S FUNNY!

85
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,005
I WANT A BABY.

86
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,207
NOT TONIGHT, HONEY.

87
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,609
I GOT AN EARLY DAY TOMORROW.

88
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,710
GET UP.

89
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,312
LET'S GET SOME COFFEE.

90
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,513
OH, OKAY...

91
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,515
BECAUSE WE NEVER DO THAT.

92
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,917
 SHOOT! SHOOT! SHOOT!

93
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,819
SHOOT... OR JUST FALL DOWN.

94
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,020
THAT'S GOOD, TOO.

95
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,021
KNICK FAN?

96
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:42,822
OH, YEAH.

97
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,325
OH, BOY, DO THEY SUCK.

98
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,326
HEY, LISTEN, LADY...

99
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,728
WHOA.

100
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:49,929
LOOK.

101
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,031
LOOK AT YOUR MAN EWING. NICE SHOT.

102
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,233
HE COULDN'T HIT WATER

103
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,335
IF HE WAS STANDING ON A BOAT.

104
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,636
OH, YEAH? AND WHO DO YOU LIKE?

105
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:57,937
THE CELTICS.

106
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:58,938
CELTICS? HA!

107
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,341
THEY COULDN'T HIT A BOAT IF...

108
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,542
WAIT.

109
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,346
THEY SUCK, ALL RIGHT?

110
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,648
OH, SHUT UP-- IT'S A REBUILDING YEAR.

111
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:09,849

112
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,751
WHA? WHA AH? LET ME GET A FATHER.

113
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,353
HEY, WE NEED A FATHER OVER HERE!

114
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,554
WE NEED A FATHER!

115
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,556
THERE IS... NO FATHER.

116
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,157
OH...OH.

117
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,359
SORRY.

118
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,560
OH, THAT'S OKAY.

119
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,761
I'M FINE.

120
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,962

00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,564
OH! UH... OKAY.

122
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:25,765
RIGHT THIS WAY.

123
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:30,169
ALL THE OTHER PREGNANT WOMEN SEEM TO BE GOING IN HERE.

124
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,375

125
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:39,779

131
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,197
THANKS, ROSS.

132
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,499
I'M PAYING YOU TO STOP.

133
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,800
OKAY.

134
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,504
OH, LOOK. TWINS.

135
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,705
HI, GUYS.

136
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,707
OH, CUTE, CUTE.

137
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:08,908
NO FAIR.

138
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,510
I DON'T EVEN HAVE ONE.

139
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,111
HOW COME THEY GET TWO?

140
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,713
YOU'LL GET ONE.

141
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:14,914
OH, YEAH? WHEN?

142
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,516
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

143
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,319
WHEN WE'RE 40, IF NEITHER OF US ARE MARRIED

144
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,422
WHAT DO YOU SAY YOU AND I GET TOGETHER AND HAVE ONE?

145
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,223
WHY WON'T I BE MARRIED WHEN I'M 40?

146
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,425
OH, NO, NO.

147
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,427
I JUST MEANT HYPOTHETICALLY.

148
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,830
OKAY, HYPOTHETICALLY-- WHY WON'T I BE MARRIED WHEN I'M 40?

149
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,031
NO... NO, NO.

150
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,733
NO. WHAT IS IT? SERIOUSLY.

151
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,135
IS THERE SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY UNMARRIABLE ABOUT ME?

152
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,537
UH... UH...

153
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,338
WELL?

154
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,740
DEAR GOD!

155
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,142
THIS PARACHUTE IS A KNAPSACK!

156
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,945
HEY.

157
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,146
HEY. OOH!

158
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,549
LOOK AT YOU, DRESSY DRESS.

159
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,351
DID YOU GO HOME AND CHANGE?

160
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,753
YEAH, WELL, IT'S AN IMPORTANT DAY.

161
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,355
I WANT TO LOOK NICE.

162
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,757
UM... HAS DR. FRANZBLAU BEEN BY?

163
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,560
NO. I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

164
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,061
WELL, WHERE IS HE?

165
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,464
HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

166
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,565
WHAT IF THE BABY

167
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,166
NEEDS HIM?

168
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,169
RACHEL, WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH YOU AND DOCTORS ANYWAY?

169
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,771
IS, LIKE, YOUR FATHER A DOCTOR?

170
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,373
YEAH. WHY?

171
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,576
NO REASON.

172
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,580
MOM, WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.

173
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,582
NO, I AM NOT CALLING HIM.

174
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,984
I DON'T CARE IF IT IS HIS KID.

175
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,586
THE GUY'S A JERK.

176
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,588
NO, I AM NOT ALONE.

177
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,391
JOEY'S HERE.

178
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,393
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, JOEY WHO?

179
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:35,895
TRIBBIANI.

180
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,697
JOEY TRIBBIANI.

181
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,500
YES... OKAY.

182
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,701
HOLD ON.

183
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,103
SHE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

184
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,306
TAKE THE PHONE.

185
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:48,508
HI.

186
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,109
YEAH, IT'S ME.

187
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,111
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

188
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,113
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

189
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,716
YEAH, I'M SINGLE.

190
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,718
25.

191
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,319
AN ACTOR.

192
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,321
HELLO?

193
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,928
SHE'S NOT MUCH OF A PHONE PERSON.

194
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,129
YEAH.

195
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,332
SO, UH, WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THIS FATHER GUY?

196
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,835
IF SOMEONE WAS HAVING MY BABY SOMEWHERE

197
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,437
I'D WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

198
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,941
HEY, KNICK FAN, AM I INTERESTED IN YOUR VIEWS ON FATHERHOOD?

199
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,142
UM,NO.

200
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,744
OKAY.

201
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,146
LOOK, MAYBE I SHOULD JUST GO.

202
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,147
MAYBE YOU SHOULD.

203
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,049
GOOD LUCK.

204
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,051
AND TAKE CARE, HUH?

205
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,561
YOU KNOW WHAT THE CELTICS' PROBLEM IS?

206
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,162
THEY LET THE PLAYERS RUN THE TEAM.

207
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,263
OH, THAT IS SO NOT TRUE.

208
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:45,565
OH, IT IS. IT ISN'T.

209
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,365
IT IS! ISN'T!

210
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,567
BREATHE. BREATHE.

211
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,367
BREATHE. BREATHE.

212
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:49,569
BREATHE. BREATHE.

213
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,571
YOU'RE GONNA KILL ME!

214
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,573
15 MORE SECONDS. 14, 13, 12...

215
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,774
COUNT FASTER.

216
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:55,975
IT'S OKAY.

217
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,977
JUST REMEMBER-- WE'RE DOING IT FOR JORDIE.

218
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,579
FOCUS. HE'LL BE HERE BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

219
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,280
... FOUR, THREE, TWO...

220
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,482
WHO THE HELL IS JORDIE?

221
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,383
YOUR SON.

222
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,185
I DON'T HAVE A SON NAMED JORDIE.

223
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,588
WE ALL AGREED MY SON'S NAME IS JAMIE.

224
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,991
WELL, JAMIE WAS THE NAME OF SUSAN'S FIRST GIRLFRIEND

225
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,993
SO WE WENT BACK TO JORDIE.

226
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,096
WHOA-- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BACKTO JORDIE?

227
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,098
WE NEVER LANDED ON JORDIE.

228
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,299
WE JUST PASSED BY IT

229
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,503
DURING THE WHOLE JESSE CODY DYLAN FIASCO.

230
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,805
OW! OW! OW! LEG CRAMP! LEG CRAMP!

231
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,807
 I GOT IT! I GOT IT!

232
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,910
HEY! YOU GET TO SLEEP WITH HER, I GET THE CRAMPS.

233
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,712
OH... NO, YOU DON'T.

234
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:33,913
THAT IS IT.

235
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,114
I WANT BOTH OF YOU OUT.

236
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,315
HE STARTED IT!

237
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:37,116
YOU STARTED IT!

238
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,317
I DON'T CARE!

239
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,720
I AM TRYING TO GET A PERSON OUT OF MY BODY HERE

240
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,722
AND YOU'RE NOT MAKING IT ANY EASIER.

241
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,323
NOW GO!

242
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,927
THANKS A LOT.

243
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,529
SEE WHAT YOU DID.

244
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,730
OUT!

245
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:57,236
BREATHE, BREATHE, BREATHE.

246
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,238
OH, NO.

247
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,040
EW!

248
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,642
WHAT WAS THAT?

249
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,243
SOMETHING EXPLODED!

250
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:06,946
THAT'S NOT THE BABY, IS IT?

251
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,248
IT'S JUST HER WATER BREAKING. CALM DOWN.

252
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:10,950
WATER BREAKING? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

253
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,552
WHAT'S THAT-- WATER BREAKING?

254
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:13,452
BREATHE.

255
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,755
BREATHE.

256
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,558
OKAY, OKAY.

257
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,259
LET'S DISCUSS THIS.

258
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,662
OKAY, OKAY.

259
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,064
OH, PLEASE, THIS IS SO YOUR FAULT.

260
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,666
HOW? HOW IS THIS MY FAULT?

261
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,867
CAROL NEVER THREW ME OUT OF A ROOM

262
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,368
BEFORE YOU CAME ALONG.

263
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,370
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS CAROL NEVER DID

264
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,572
BEFORE I CAME ALONG.

265
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,074
OH, YOU'RE TRYING TO BE CLEVER?

266
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,076
YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS?

267
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,678
YOU'RE SO THREATENED BY ME...

268
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,279
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT!

269
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,480
GET IN HERE!

270
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,082
COME ON.

271
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,084
MY GOD, YOU GUYS, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

272
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,486
THERE ARE CHILDREN COMING INTO THE WORLD

273
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:48,688
IN THIS VERY BUILDING

274
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,690
AND YOUR NEGATIVE FIGHTING NOISES

275
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,092
ARE NOT THE FIRST THING THEY SHOULD BE HEARING

276
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,694
SO JUST STOP ALL THE YELLING.

277
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,295
JUST STOP IT!

278
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,698
YEAH, SUSAN.

279
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,299
DON'T MAKE ME DO THIS AGAIN.

280
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,702
I DON'T LIKE MY VOICE LIKE THIS.

281
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:10,309
OKAY, WHO WANTS TO HEAR SOMETHING IRONIC?

282
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,216

283
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,818

00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,419
BUT WE'RE GOING TO FIND THEM

285
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,220
AND UNTIL WE DO

286
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,822
WE ARE ALL HERE FOR YOU, OKAY?

287
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,023
OKAY. OKAY?

00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,227
SO YOU WERE TELLING ME ABOUT PARIS.

00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,830
THERE WAS THIS GREAT LITTLE PASTRY SHOP

291
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,031

292
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,733

293
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,334

00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,661
AND A HELPER... GUY.

383
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,864
SO, DID YOU SEE WHO WON THE GAME?

384
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,666
YEAH. KNICKS BY TEN.

385
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,268
THEY SUCK.

386
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,471
AW, THEY'RE NOT SO BAD.

387
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:58,097
ON! COME ON. COME

388
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,598
I THINK YOU'RE DOING IT TOO HARD.

389
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:02,001
YOU HAVE TO DO IT HARD, OR ELSE IT DOESN'T...

390
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,803
DAMN IT! DAMN IT!

391
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,005
DAMN IT, DAMN IT!

392
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,206
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

393
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,908
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE, LIKE

394
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,509
THE GREATEST DAY OF MY LIFE.

395
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,312
MY SON IS BEING BORN, AND I SHOULD BE IN THERE.

396
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,314
INSTEAD, I'M STUCK IN A CLOSET WITH YOU.

397
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,916
THE WOMAN I LOVE IS HAVING A BABY.

398
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,918
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS JUST AS MUCH AS YOU.

399
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,819
BELIEVE ME, NO ONE HAS BEEN WAITING FOR THIS

400
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,021
AS MUCH AS I HAVE, OKAY?

401
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,622
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE FUNNY THING IS?

402
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:24,823
WHEN THIS DAY IS OVER

403
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,425
YOU GET TO GO HOME WITH THE BABY.

404
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,626
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE ME?

405
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,528
YOU GET TO BE THE BABY'S FATHER.

406
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,530
EVERYONE KNOWS WHO YOU ARE, AND WHO AM I?

407
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,933
THERE'S FATHER'S DAY, THERE'S MOTHER'S DAY.

408
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,935
THERE'S NO... LESBIAN LOVER DAY.

409
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,537
EVERY DAY IS LESBIAN LOVER DAY.

410
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,042
THIS IS SO GREAT.

411
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,048
YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN THAT?

412
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,250
I MEAN, BECAUSE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP

413
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,053
YOU KNOW, MY DAD LEFT AND MY MOTHER DIED

414
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,055
AND MY STEPFATHER WENT TO JAIL

415
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,457
SO I BARELY HAD ENOUGH PIECES OF PARENTS

416
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,059
TO MAKE ONE WHOLE ONE

417
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,560
AND HERE'S THIS LITTLE BABY

418
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,761
WHO HAS, LIKE

419
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:03,963
THREE WHOLE PARENTS

420
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,765
WHO CARE ABOUT IT SO MUCH THAT THEY'RE FIGHTING

421
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,767
OVER WHO GETS TO LOVE IT THE MOST

422
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,369
AND IT'S NOT EVEN BORN YET.

423
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,771
IT'S JUST... IT'S JUST THE LUCKIEST BABY

424
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:13,973
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

425
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,077
I'M SORRY. YOU WERE FIGHTING.

426
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,780
WHERE ARE THEY?

427
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,982
THEY'LL BE HERE SOON.

428
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,384
YEAH, HONEY, THEY WOULDN'T MISS THIS.

429
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,786
RELAX. YOU'RE ONLY AT NINE CENTIMETERS

430
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,788
AND THE BABY'S AT ZERO STATION.

431
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,794
HEY, YOU ARE REALLY FRIGHTENING ME.

432
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,796

433
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,199
SOMEBODY WANT TO HELP ME?

434
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,201
TRYING TO RIP OUT MY HEART.

435
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:43,902
UH, THAT'S GREAT.

436
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,904
ANYBODY SEEN A NIPPLE?

437
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,407
ALL RIGHT, TEN CENTIMETERS.

438
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:49,608
HERE WE GO.

439
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,610
HONEY, TIME TO START PUSHING.

440
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,212
THEY'RE NOT HERE YET.

441
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,514
SORRY. I CAN'T TELL THE BABY TO WAIT FOR THEM.

442
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,916
OH, GOD!

443
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,420

444
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,322
OKAY, GOT THE VENT OPEN.

WELL, SUSAN, I SEE WHAT APPEARS TO BE A DARK VENT.

00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:18,677

553
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,908
AND SOMETIMES, I'LL WANT YOU TO STEAL THIRD

554
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,510

555
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,721
HE IS SO AMAZING.

556
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:03,922
OH, I KNOW.

557
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,524
LOOK AT HIM.

558
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:09,127

559
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,129
HEY, BEN.

560
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,331
NOTHING.

561
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,333
I DON'T THINK THAT'S HIS NAME.

562
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,135
OH, LOOK, LOOK

563
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,337
HE'S CLOSING HIS EYES.

564
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,139
OH, LOOK, HE'S OPENING HIS EYES.

565
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,745
HE DOESN'T DO MUCH, DOES HE?

566
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,147
NO. THIS IS PRETTY MUCH IT.

567
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:37,956
YOU GUYS WANT TO GET SOME COFFEE?

568
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,558
YEAH. YEAH.

569
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,159
YEAH. YEAH.

570
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,161
SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

572
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:14,393

573
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,994

574
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,195
HE'S CLOSING HIS EYES AGAIN.
