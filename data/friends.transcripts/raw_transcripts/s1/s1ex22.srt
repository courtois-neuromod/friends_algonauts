1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:00,800

2
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:02,702
PLEASE TELL HIM.

3
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:03,503
SHUT UP.

4
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:05,205
TELL ME WHAT?

5
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,606
LOOK AT YOU-- YOU WON'T EVEN LOOK AT HIM.

6
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:08,208
OH, COME ON, TELL ME.

7
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:11,811
I COULD USE ANOTHER REASON WHY WOMEN WON'T LOOK AT ME.

8
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,613
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

9
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:18,418
LAST NIGHT, I HAD A DREAM THAT, UM, YOU AND I WERE, UH...

10
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,120
DOING IT ON THIS TABLE.

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,222
WOW!

12
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:25,425
EXCELLENT DREAM SCORE.

13
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:31,031
WHY, WHY... WHY WOULD YOU DREAM THAT?

14
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,832
MORE IMPORTANTLY:

15
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:35,235
WAS I ANY GOOD?

16
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:39,239
WELL, YOU WERE PRETTY DAMN "ANY GOOD."

17
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,341
INTERESTING, BECAUSE IN MY DREAMS

18
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:42,942
I'M SURPRISINGLY INADEQUATE.

19
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:47,647
WELL, LAST NIGHT, YOU SEEMED TO KNOW YOUR WAY

20
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,949
AROUND THE TABLE.

21
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,951

22
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:53,953
I LOVE IT WHEN WE SHARE.

23
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,159
YOU OKAY THERE?

24
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,961
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TWO HAD SEX IN HER DREAM.

25
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,563
WELL, I'M SORRY.

26
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,165
IT WAS A ONE TIME THING.

27
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,766
I WAS VERY DRUNK

28
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:09,169
AND IT WAS SOMEONE ELSE'S SUBCONSCIOUS.

42
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,820
HELLO, RACHEL.

43
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:02,422
GET OFF.

44
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,225
OOH! GIVE ME.

45
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,426
CAN YOU SEE ME

46
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,428
OPERATING A DRILL PRESS?

47
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:11,231
I DON'T KNOW. WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

48
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,538
PHEEBS, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO OPERATE A DRILL PRESS?

49
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,140
JUST FOR SOME SHORT TERM WORK.

50
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,542
YOU KNOW, TILL I GET BACK SOME OF MY MASSAGE CLIENTS.

51
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,844
PIRATES AGAIN?

52
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,946
NO. NOTHING LIKE THAT.

53
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:29,349
I'M JUST... SUCH A DUMMY.

54
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,952
I TAUGHT THIS "MASSAGE YOURSELF AT HOME" WORKSHOP.

55
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,554
AND THEY ARE.

56
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:36,956
HEY, HEY, CHAN--

57
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:38,958
SHE COULD WORK FOR YOU.

58
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,361
THANKS, JOEY. THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

59
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,463
I COULD. I COULD DO IT!

60
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,664
WHAT IS IT?

61
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,467
MY SECRETARY WILL BE OUT FOR A COUPLE WEEKS.

62
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,068
SHE'S HAVING ONE

63
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,270
OF HER BOOBS REDUCED.

64
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,972
IT'S A WHOLE BIG BOOB STORY.

65
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,574
WELL, I COULD BE A SECRETARY.

66
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,677
WELL, YOU KNOW, PHEEBS, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S YOUR KIND OF THING

67
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,880
BECAUSE IT INVOLVES A LOT OF BEING NORMAL...

68
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,882
FOR A LARGE PORTION OF THE DAY.

69
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,285
I COULD DO THAT.

70
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,386

71
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,587
WHAT ARE YOU PLAYING WITH?

72
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:08,788
OH, IT'S MY NEW BEEPER.

73
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,290
WHAT THE HELL DOES A PALEONTOLOGIST

74
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,491
NEED A BEEPER FOR?

75
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,293
IS IT LIKE FOR DINOSAUR EMERGENCIES?

76
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,695
"HELP! COME QUICK! THEY'RE STILL EXTINCT!"

77
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:19,098
NO. IT'S FOR WHEN CAROL GOES INTO LABOR.

78
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,501
SHE CAN GET ME WHEREVER I AM.

79
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,704
ALL SHE HAS TO DO IS DIAL 55 JIMBO.

80
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,105
A COOL PHONE NUMBER

81
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:28,908
AND A POSSIBLE NAME FOR THE KID.

82
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:29,909
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

83
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,611
OFF TO SEE YOUNG ETHAN?

84
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:32,812
THANK YOU.

85
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,417
HOW YOUNG IS YOUNG ETHAN? YOUNG?

86
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,220
HE'S... OUR AGE.

87
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,222
WHEN WE WERE...?

88
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,427
OKAY. HE'S A SENIOR IN COLLEGE.

89
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:48,228
COLLEGE?

90
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,329
WHOA.

91
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,931
OOH, ROB THAT CRADLE.

92
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:56,135
YEAH, WELL, HE'S SMART AND AND MATURE AND GROWN UP.

93
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:57,737
MATURE AND GROWN UP.

94
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,139
HE'S A BIG BOY.

95
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,842
AND THIS MAN CHILD HAS NO PROBLEM

96
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,444
WITH HOW OLD YOU ARE?

97
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,845
NO. OF COURSE NOT.

98
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,447
IT'S NOT EVEN AN ISSUE.

99
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,849
BECAUSE I TOLD HIM I WAS 22.

100
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,251
WHAT?

101
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,253
OH, I CAN'T PASS FOR 22?

102
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,355
WELL, MAYBE 25, 26.

103
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,656
I AM 26.

104
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,057
THERE YOU GO.

105
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,764

106
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,968

107
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,371
CAN YOU HEAR THAT?

108
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,874
YEAH.

109
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,376
YOU SEE, THAT'LL STOP

110
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,778
WHEN YOU PICK UP THE PHONE.

111
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,079
OH!

112
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,482
OOH! I'M ON.

113
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,484
OKAY.

114
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:48,087
 MR. BING'S OFFICE.

115
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,689
NO, I'M SORRY.

116
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,691
HE'S IN A MEETING RIGHT NOW.

117
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,293
I'M NOT IN A MEETING.

118
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,095
WILL HE KNOW WHAT THIS IS IN REFERENCE TO?

119
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,097
AND HE HAS YOUR NUMBER?

120
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,099
I'LL SEE THAT HE GETS THE MESSAGE.

121
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,301
BYE BYE.

122
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,604
WHA...

123
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,805
ROSS SAYS HI.

124
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,407
AH.

125
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,608
THIS IS SO FUN.

126
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,209
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

127
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:13,413
WELL, NOW, I ACTUALLY HAVE TO GET TO WORK.

128
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,214
"MOST LIKELY."

129
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:18,017

130
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,219
OKAY. I'M GOING TO BE OUT THERE.

131
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,421
OKAY.

132
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,522
ALL RIGHT.

133
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,723
BYE BYE.

134
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:24,924
BYE BYE.

135
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,530

136
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,731
YES?

137
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,133
 What you doin'?

138
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,538
OKAY, WINDOWS ARE CLEAN.

139
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,540
CANDLES ARE LIT.

140
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,541
OOH, BELT'S TOO TIGHT.

141
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,742
GOT TO CHANGE IT.

142
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,344
DID I TURN THE FISH?

143
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,045
NOPE. BECAUSE I MADE LASAGNA.

144
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,848
AM I OUT OF CONTROL?

145
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,850
JUST A TOUCH.

146
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,452
MON, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

147
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,854
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN DATING THIS GUY

148
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,856
SINCE LIKE, WHAT, HIS MIDTERMS.

149
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,858
I MEAN, WHY ALL OF A SUDDEN

150
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,360
ARE YOU SO...

151
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,764
OHHH.

152
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,665
WHAT?

153
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,569
COULD TONIGHT BE THE NIGHT?

154
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,371
I DON'T KNOW.

155
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:15,775
LOOK, HE'S A GREAT GUY AND I LOVE BEING WITH HIM

156
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,978
BUT, YOU KNOW, THINGS HAPPEN WHEN THEY HAPPEN.

157
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,980
YOU DON'T PLAN THESE THINGS.

158
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,984
OH. SO DID YOU SHAVE YOUR LEGS?

159
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:25,885
YEAH.

160
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,286
UH HUH.

161
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,190
WOULD YOU LET IT GO, ROSS?

162
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,792
IT WAS JUST A DREAM.

163
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:33,993
IT DOESN'T MEAN...

164
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,595

165
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,796
OOH HOO!

166
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:37,997
OOH, THIS IS IT!

167
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,400
OH, MY GOD! IT'S BABY TIME, BABY TIME!

168
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,001
RELAX, JUST RELAX. BE COOL. BE COOL.

169
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:45,405
YEAH, HI. I WAS JUST BEEPED.

170
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,809
NO. ANDRE IS NOT HERE.

171
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,211
THIRD TIME TODAY.

172
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,213
YES, I AM SURE.

173
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,417
NO, SIR, I DO NOT PERFORM THOSE KIND OF SERVICES.

174
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,419
SERVICES?

175
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,622
OOH. SERVICES.

00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:06,025

THAT'S RIGHT.

179
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,233
THAT'S RIGHT. JUMBO WITH A "U," SIR.

180
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,636
NO. BELIEVE ME, YOU DON'T WANT ME.

181
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,237
JUDGING BY HIS NUMBER

182
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,640
I'D BE A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.

183
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,042
ALL RIGHTY. BYE BYE.

184
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,044
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

185
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:26,345
 HEY, HEY!

186
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,947
HOW WAS THE FIRST DAY?

187
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,549
OH. EXCELLENT.

188
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,351
EVERYONE WAS SO, SO NICE.

189
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,954
SEE? IT PAYS TO KNOW THE MAN WHO WEARS MY SHOES.

190
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,556
ME.

191
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,757
OH.

192
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:38,958
NO, I DIDN'T TELL

193
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,960
ANYBODY THAT I KNEW YOU.

194
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,761
WHY NOT?

195
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,763
WELL, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW...

196
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,364
THEY DON'T LIKE YOU.

197
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,770
WHAT?

198
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,271
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW THAT.

199
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,273
NUH UH.

200
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,875
WHO DOESN'T LIKE ME?

201
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,977
EVERYONE.

202
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,979
EXCEPT FOR, UM...

203
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,381
NO. EVERYONE.

204
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,085
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

205
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:07,587
DON'T FEEL BAD.

206
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,989
YOU KNOW, THEY USED TO LIKE YOU A LOT.

207
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,892
BUT THEN YOU GOT PROMOTED, AND, YOU KNOW

208
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,594
NOW YOU'RE ALL, LIKE, MR. BOSS MAN.

209
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,996
YOU KNOW, MR. BING. MR. BING-- BOSS MAN BING.

210
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,900
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

211
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,102
YEAH, YEAH. THEY EVEN DO YOU.

212
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,404
THEY DO ME?

213
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,807
YOU KNOW, LIKE, UM... OKAY.

214
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:31,010
"COULD THAT REPORT BE ANY LATER?"

215
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,513

216
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,618
I DON'T SOUND LIKE THAT.

217
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,019
OH, OH, CHANDLER... YEAH, YOU DO.

218
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,824
"THE HILLS ARE ALIVE WITH THE SOUND...

219
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,226
OF MUSIC."

220
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,332
MY SCONE!

221
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,434
 MY SCONE!

222
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,437
OKAY, I DON'T SOUND LIKE THAT.

223
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,039
THAT IS SO NOT TRUE.

224
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,643
THAT IS SO NOT...

225
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:04,844
THAT IS SO NO...

226
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,045
THAT...

227
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,647
OH, SHUT UP!

228
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:11,951
YOU DID NOT.

229
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,953
I AM TELLING YOU, UP UNTIL I WAS, LIKE, NINE

230
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:17,156
I THOUGHT THAT GUNPOINT WAS AN ACTUAL PLACE WHERE CRIMES HAPPENED.

231
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,157
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

232
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,358
WELL, THINK ABOUT IT.

233
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,360
IT'S ALWAYS ON THE NEWS:

234
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,763
"A MAN IS BEING HELD UP AT GUNPOINT."

235
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,165
"TOURISTS ARE BEING TERRORIZED AT GUNPOINT."

236
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,867
AND I JUST KEPT THINKING

237
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,869
"WHY DO PEOPLE CONTINUE TO GO THERE?"

238
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,676
OH, AH... I SHOULD GO.

239
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,678
OKAY.

240
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,585
OKAY.

241
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,485
UNLESS...

242
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:47,687
WHAT?

243
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:51,290
UH, UH, UNLESS YOU WANT TO STAY OVER.

244
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,093
I MEAN, I'M GOING TO, SO...

245
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,898
YEAH. I'D REALLY LIKE THAT.

246
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,303

247
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,504
UH...

248
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:09,008
BEFORE WE GET INTO ANY STAYING OVER STUFF

249
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,410
THERE'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW.

250
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,012
OKAY.

251
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,413
IS THIS LIKE

252
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,816
"I HAVE AN EARLY CLASS TOMORROW

253
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,619
OR, "I'M SECRETLY MARRIED TO A GOAT"?

254
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,822
WELL, IT'S SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN.

255
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:26,025
YOU SEE, IN A STRICTLY TECHNICAL SENSE, OF COURSE

256
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,627
I'M NOT, UH...

257
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,830
WELL, I MEAN, I HAVEN'T EVER, UM...

258
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,431
ETHAN? YEAH?

259
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,433
ARE YOU A VIRGIN?

260
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,636
WELL... IF THAT'S WHAT YOU KIDS

261
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,638
ARE CALLING IT THESE DAYS

262
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,239
THEN, YES, I AM.

263
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,242
WOW!

264
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,443
I MEAN...

265
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,445
WELL, YOU'RE JUST SUCH A GOOD KISSER

266
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,047
I WOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN.

267
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:51,150
OH, WELL, I'VE EXCELLED AT EVERY LEVEL I'VE BEEN TO

268
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,351
I JUST...

269
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,657
I JUST HAVEN'T BEEN TO THAT PARTICULAR ONE... YET.

270
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,459
I, UH, I'VE KIND OF BEEN WAITING

271
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,461
FOR THE RIGHT PERSON.

272
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,664
REALLY?

273
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,865
YEAH.

274
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:08,668
YOU DO KNOW

275
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,269
I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU, RIGHT?

276
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,280
WOW!

277
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,282
YOU KEEP SAYING THAT.

278
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,084
YOU KNOW, YOU READ ABOUT IT.

279
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,086
YOU SEE IT IN THE MOVIES

280
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,488
EVEN WHEN YOU PRACTICE IT AT HOME

281
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,090
MAN, OH, MAN...

282
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,293
IT IS NOTHING LIKE THAT.

283
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,895
OH!

284
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,096
LISTEN.

285
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,498
LISTEN.

286
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,500
UM, YOU TOLD ME SOMETHING

287
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,704
THAT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR YOU

288
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,506
AND I FIGURE IF YOU CAN BE HONEST

289
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,108
THEN I CAN, TOO.

290
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,510
OH, GOD! DON'T TELL ME I DID IT WRONG.

291
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,313
NO, NO, NO.

292
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,315
NOTHING WRONG ABOUT THAT.

293
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,718
OH.

294
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:03,122
UM, OKAY. HERE GOES.

295
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,524
I'M NOT 22.

296
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:09,128
I'M, I'M 25...

297
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,130
AND 13 MONTHS.

298
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,532
HUH.

299
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:14,934
BUT I FIGURE, YOU KNOW

300
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,936
THAT SHOULDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

301
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,938
I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL DOES IT MATTER HOW OLD WE ARE?

302
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,640
I MEAN, BASICALLY, I AM NUTS ABOUT YOU.

303
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,043
YOU KNOW, I KNEW IT THE FIRST TIME THAT WE KISSED

304
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,045
AND I HAD THAT TIC TAC UNDER MY TONGUE

305
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,646
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN MENTION IT.

306
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,648
I JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE NATURALLY MINTY.

307
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,055
UH, LISTEN, UM...

308
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,457
AS LONG AS WE'RE TELLING STUFF, UH...

309
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:42,461
I HAVE ANOTHER ONE FOR YOU.

310
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:43,662
I'M A LITTLE

311
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,065
YOUNGER THAN I SAID.

312
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,868
YOU'RE NOT A SENIOR?

313
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,071
OH, I'M A SENIOR...

314
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,876
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

315
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,884
O KAY.

316
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,688
WHAT WE DID WAS WRONG.

317
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,290
OH, GOD. I JUST HAD SEX

318
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,292
WITH SOMEONE WHO WASN'T ALIVE

319
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,894
DURING THE BICENTENNIAL.

320
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,399
I JUST HAD SEX.

321
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,202
ETHAN, FOCUS.

322
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,804
HOW COULD YOU NOT TELL ME?

323
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,005
YOU NEVER

324
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,406
TOLD ME HOW OLD YOU WERE.

325
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,008
WELL, THAT'S DIFFERENT.

326
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,211
MY LIE DIDN'T MAKE ONE OF US A FELON IN 48 STATES.

327
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,814
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

328
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,816
I WASN'T THINKING. I WAS TOO BUSY FALLING...

329
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,017
DON'T SAY IT.

330
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,218
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

331
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,421
REALLY?

332
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,423
SORRY.

333
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,624
WELL, FALL OUT OF IT.

334
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,027
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE.

335
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,228
IT'S A SCHOOL NIGHT.

336
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,132
OH, GOD. OH, GOD.

337
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,935
I'M LIKE THOSE WOMEN THAT YOU SEE

338
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,737
WITH SHINY GUYS NAMED CHAD.

339
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,343
I'M JOAN COLLINS.

340
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,747
WHO?

341
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:23,262
OKAY, ANDRE SHOULD BE THERE IN ABOUT 45 MINUTES.

342
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:27,666
UH, YES, SIR, THE KIMONOS ARE EXTRA.

UH... IT'S JUST EASIER THAT WAY.

345
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:36,775
OH, COME ON.

346
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,777
YOU TOLD ME ABOUT THE LAST DREAM.

347
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,379
NO! FORGET IT.

348
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,182
WELL, WHY NOT? WAS I DOING SOMETHING PARTICULARLY...

349
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,383
SAUCY?

350
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,387
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

351
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,588
UM...

352
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,991
WELL, YOU WERE NOT THE ONLY ONE THERE.

353
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,393
JOEY WAS THERE TOO.

354
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,797
ALL RIGHT.

355
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,900
WAS THERE, UH...?

356
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,902

357
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,706
ANYBODY... ANYBODY ELSE THERE?

358
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:08,908
NO.

359
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,109
YOU SURE?

360
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:15,314
NOBODY HANDING OUT MINTS OR ANYTHING?

361
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,716
NO. IT WAS JUST THE THREE OF US.

362
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,119
OH.

363
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,021
SO, TELL ME, WAS IT LIKE YOU AND CHANDLER

364
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,222
AND THEN YOU AND ME

365
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,224
OR YOU AND ME AND CHANDLER?

366
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,825

367
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,027
YOU KNOW WHAT?

368
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,628
WHAT?

369
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,431
THERE WERE TIMES...

370
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,833
WHEN IT WASN'T EVEN ME.

371
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,036
OOH... OOH...

372
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,438

373
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,845
THAT IS SO SWEET, YOU GUYS.

374
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,351
HEY, MON.

375
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,552
HEY.

00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,154
MON, ETHAN CALLED AGAIN.

00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,660
 MON!

379
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,662

380
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:04,964
ETHAN CALLED AGAIN.

381
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,465
OH.

00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,766
WHAT, YOU'RE NOT SEEING HIM ANYMORE?

383
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,368
NO.

384
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,171
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES JUST THINGS DON'T WORK OUT.

385
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:15,174
AND THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT

386
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,375
THAT HE NEEDS A NOTE

387
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,377
TO GET OUT OF GYM?

388
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,180
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

389
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,781
I DID NOT SAY ANYTHING.

390
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:23,582
I SWEAR.

391
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:24,783
HE STOPPED BY.

392
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,785
 UH, LISTEN, NEXT TIME YOU TALK TO HIM

393
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:29,488
COULD YOU ASK HIM WHICH ONE THE STRONGEST POWER RANGER IS.

394
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,290
OH, YEAH.

395
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,492

396
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,894
OH, MY LIFE IS JUST SO AMUSING.

397
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,096
CAN WE DROP IT NOW?

398
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:37,596
SURE.

399
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:38,597
SORRY.

400
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,699

00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,401
TYRANNOSAURUS!

403
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,402

404
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,607
OOH, OH, I GOT TO GO.

405
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,609
WHOA. OOH, HEAD RUSH.

406
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:51,410
OH.

407
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,714
ONE MORE AND THEN I HAVE TO GO.

408
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,316
COOL.

409
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,920
WHERE YOU GOING?

410
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,324
UM... OH, I GOT A BIRTHDAY PARTY WITH SOME WORK PEOPLE.

411
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,626
WORK PEOPLE?

412
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,228
NOBODY TOLD ME.

413
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:10,229
NO, I KNOW.

414
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,830
THAT'S PART OF THE WHOLE, YOU KNOW

415
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,233

416
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,235
YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON'T GET THIS.

417
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:19,038
A MONTH AGO THESE PEOPLE WERE MY FRIENDS, YOU KNOW?

418
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,639
JUST BECAUSE I'M IN CHARGE

419
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,042
DOESN'T MEAN I'M A DIFFERENT PERSON.

420
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,944
WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD COME TONIGHT, YOU KNOW, JUST HANG OUT WITH THEM

421
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,946
LET THEM SEE WHAT A GREAT GUY YOU STILL ARE.

422
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,148
YOU THINK I SHOULD?

423
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,449
I REALLY DO. YEAH.

424
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:31,450
OKAY.

425
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,651
OKAY.

426
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,654
OH, BUT, UM, COULD WE NOT GO TOGETHER?

427
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,258
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE GEEK WHO INVITED THE BOSS, YOU KNOW?

428
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,263
HEY, YOU OKAY?

429
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,065
YEAH.

430
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,466
YOU KNOW, THIS, UM...

431
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,468
THIS CAN'T BE EASY FOR HIM EITHER.

432
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,070
I KNOW.

433
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,072
I MEAN, THIS MAY TAKE SOME TIME

434
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,074
FOR HIM TO GET OVER IT, YOU KNOW

435
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,876
BUT THEN AT 4:00 MUPPET BABIES IS ON.

437
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,091
SORRY, SHELLY.

438
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,795

439
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,598

440
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,799

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,502
TRACY AND I DOING "EBONY AND IVORY."

442
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,805
YOU WERE GREAT, BUT THEY STILL MADE FUN OF YOU.

443
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,107

THEN I DON'T GET IT.

448
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,918
WELL... YOU KNOW WHAT, CHANDLER

449
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,321
I THINK YOU JUST GOT TO FACE IT.

450
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,124
YOU'RE LIKE THE GUY IN THE BIG OFFICE, YOU KNOW?

451
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,327
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT HIRES THEM AND FIRES THEM.

452
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,928
THEY STILL SAY YOU'RE A GREAT BOSS.

453
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,130
THEY DO?

454
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,731
UH HUH, BUT THEY'RE NOT

455
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:53,932
YOUR FRIENDS ANYMORE.

456
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,934
BUT I JUST WANT TO...

457
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,136
BUT YOU CAN'T.

458
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,737
BUT I JUST WANT...

459
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,339
NUH UH.

460
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,946

461
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,150
AREN'T YOU GOING TO..?

462
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,152
OH, CAROL AND I HAVE A NEW SYSTEM.

463
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,755
IF SHE PUNCHES IN 911 IT MEANS SHE'S HAVING A BABY.

464
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,757
OTHERWISE, I JUST IGNORE IT.

465
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,159
WHAT ABOUT ANDRE?

466
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,960
WELL, THIS MORNING HE GOT A CALL

467
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,363
FROM WHAT I THINK WAS OUR COUSIN NATHAN

468
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,365
AND FRANKLY, IT WAS A LITTLE MORE

469
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,466
THAN I NEEDED TO KNOW.

470
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,672
HEY.

471
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,775
THAT WAS GOING TO BE MY OPENER.

472
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,877
HEY... DID YOU GUYS CHECK OUT

473
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,280
THOSE NEW HAND DRYERS IN THE BATHROOM?

474
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,881
I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST A RUMOR.

475
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,883
TRUE STORY.

476
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,089
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

477
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,691
I'M NOT 17. I ONLY SAID THAT

478
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,494
SO YOU'D THINK I WAS CUTE AND VULNERABLE.

479
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,395
I'M ACTUALLY 30.

480
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,996
I HAVE A WIFE, I HAVE A JOB.

481
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,198
I'M YOUR CONGRESSMAN.

482
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,801
MONICA, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

483
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,002
WE ARE GREAT TOGETHER.

484
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,405
WE CAN TALK, WE MAKE EACH OTHER LAUGH

485
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,206
AND THE SEX...

486
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,608
OKAY. I HAVE NO FRAME OF REFERENCE

487
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,210
BUT I THOUGHT THAT WAS GREAT.

488
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,811
IT WAS.

489
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,413
THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

490
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:20,018
ETHAN IT'S, UM...

491
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,020
IT'S ICKY.

492
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,022
ICKY?

493
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,425
YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO THROW THIS AWAY

494
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,427
BECAUSE IT'S ICKY?

495
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,129
LOOK, THIS ISN'T EASY FOR ME EITHER.

496
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,131
I WISH THINGS WERE DIFFERENT.

497
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,133
IF YOU WERE A FEW YEARS OLDER

498
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,536
OR I WAS A FEW YEARS YOUNGER OR...

499
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,137
WE LIVED IN BIBLICAL TIMES...

500
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,139
I COULD REALLY...

501
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,741
NO, DON'T SAY IT.

502
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,343
LOVE YOU.

503
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:50,148
ARE YOUR HANDS STILL WET?

504
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:51,350
MOIST.

505
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,951
LET'S DRY THEM AGAIN.

506
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:02,160
I'M LIKE, "COULD THESE MARGARITASBEANY STRONGER?"

507
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:05,764
HEY, CHANDLER.

508
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,366
HELLO, MR. BING.

509
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,168

00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,278
NO PROBLEM.

00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,383
YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM SOMETHING, YOU KNOW.

515
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,984
THAT WAS GERSTON, SANTOS...

516
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,986

517
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,187

542
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:51,770
I DON'T HAVE THE PHONE.

543
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,772

544
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,175

00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:13,692
WHAT, SO I CAN'T LOOK NICE?

553
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,293
THERE MIGHT BE DOCTORS THERE.

554
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,295
JOEY, GET OUT OF THE FRIDGE.

555
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,897
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,499

I'M GOING TO BE AN AUNT.

565
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,811
I'M GOING TO HAVE A NEPHEW.
