00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,206

2
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,714
 OH, RACH, WE'RE RUNNING LOW

3
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,416
ON RESUMES OVER HERE.

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,518
DO YOU REALLY WANT A JOB WITH POPULAR MECHANICS?

5
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,920
WELL, IF YOU'RE GOING TO WORK FOR MECHANICS

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,522
THOSE ARE THE ONES TO WORK FOR.

7
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,725
HEY, LOOK, YOU GUYS, I'M GOING FOR ANYTHING HERE, OKAY?

8
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:28,528
I CANNOT BE A WAITRESS ANYMORE. I MEAN IT.

9
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,130
I'M SICK OF THE LOUSY TIPS

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,932
SICK OF BEING CALLED "EXCUSE ME."

11
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:36,436
OW! OH, PAPER CUT, PAPER CUT!

12
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,038

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,243
GRAPEFRUIT JUICE! GRAPEFRUIT JUICE!

14
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,046
OKAY, YOU GUYS, WE'RE ALMOST DONE.

15
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,647
WE'VE ONLY GOT 20 MORE TO GO.

16
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,249
RACH, DID YOU PROOFREAD THESE?

17
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,251
UH, YEAH. WHY?

18
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,852
UH, NOTHING.

19
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,854
I'M SURE THEY'LL BE IMPRESSED

20
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,058
WITH YOUR EXCELLENT "COMPUPER" SKILLS.

21
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,659
OH, MY GOD!

22
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,862
OH, DO YOU THINK IT'S ON ALL OF THEM?

23
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,167
OH, NO.

24
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,569
I'M SURE THE XEROX MACHINE CAUGHT A FEW.

25
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,973

26
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:24,484

27
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:29,389
?  ?

28
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,391
?  ?

29
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:34,394
?  ?

30
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:38,098
?  ?

31
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,400
? AND IT HASN'T BEEN YOUR DAY ?

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,404
?  ?

33
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:47,407
?  ?

34
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:50,009
?  ?

35
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,812
?  ?

36
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,414
?  ?

37
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:58,318
?  ?

38
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:04,124
?  ?

39
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,730
YOU KNOW, I KNOW THEY CALL THIS A LOVE SEAT

40
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,434
BUT I'M NOT REALLY FEELING ANYTHING SPECIAL TOWARDS YOU.

41
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,144
HEY, GUYS.

42
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,345
 HEY.

43
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,546
HEY.

44
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,148
HI, LADIES.

45
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,150
UH, CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

46
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,552
DID YOU BRING THE MAIL?

47
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:33,753
LOTS OF RESPONSES.

48
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:34,954
REALLY?

49
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,956
SURE WE HAVE SCONES LEFT.

50
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,558
OKAY, READ THEM TO ME.

51
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,861
"DEAR MS. GREEN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR INQUIRY.

52
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,463
HOWEVER..."

53
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,465
WE HAVE APPLE CINNAMON...

54
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,467
OKAY, "DEAR MS. GREEN..."

55
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,668
YEP, YEP, YEP.

56
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,270
NO.

57
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:52,572
WOW.

58
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:53,473
WHAT?

59
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,475
YOUR VISA BILL IS HUGE.

60
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,977
GIVE ME THAT.

61
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,679
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU. LINDA IS SO GREAT.

62
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,281
WHY WON'T YOU GO OUT WITH HER AGAIN?

63
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,482
I DON'T KNOW.

64
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,184
IS THIS STILL ABOUT HER WHOLE

65
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,385
"THE FLINTSTONES

66
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,387
COULD HAVE REALLY HAPPENED" THING?

67
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,289
NO. IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

68
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,492
IT'S JUST I WANT SOMEONE WHO DOES SOMETHING FOR ME.

69
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,494
WHO GETS MY HEART POUNDING.

70
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,597
WHO... WHO MAKES ME, UH...

71
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:21,000
LITTLE PLAY THINGS WITH YARN?

72
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,604
WHAT?

73
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,807
COULD YOU WANT HER MORE?

74
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,409
WHO?

75
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,612
DEE, THE SARCASTIC SISTER FROM WHAT'S HAPPENING.

76
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,018
LOOK, I...

77
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:42,222
LOOK, I AM TOTALLY, TOTALLY OVER HER, OKAY...

78
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,423
HI.

79
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,624
HI. CAN I HELP YOU?

80
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,825
NO. WE'RE FINE.

81
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,026
OKAY.

82
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,332

83
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,533
SHUT UP!

84
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,535
WE'RE NOT SAYING ANYTHING.

85
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,336
WHAT?

86
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,438
UH, JOEY CRIED LAST NIGHT.

87
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,340
THANK YOU.

88
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,142
WE WERE PLAYING POKER, ALL RIGHT...

89
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,744
THERE WAS CHOCOLATE ON THE THREE.

90
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,346
IT LOOKED LIKE

91
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,347
AN EIGHT, ALL RIGHT?

92
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,349
OH, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIM.

93
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,550
"READ THEM AND WEEP."

94
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,151
AND THEN HE DID.

95
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,755
WELL, NOW, HOW COME YOU GUYS

96
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,157
HAVE NEVER PLAYED POKER WITH US?

97
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,459
YEAH, WHAT IS THAT--

98
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,060
LIKE, SOME KIND OF GUY THING?

99
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,062
LIKE, SOME KIND OF SEXIST GUY THING?

100
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,064
LIKE, IT'S POKER, SO ONLY GUYS CAN PLAY.

101
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,166
NO. WOMEN ARE WELCOME TO PLAY.

102
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,468
OH, OKAY, SO THEN WHAT IS IT?

103
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,069

00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,275
THERE JUST DON'T HAPPEN

107
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,877
TO BE ANY WOMEN IN OUR GAME.

108
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:40,079
YEAH, WE JUST DON'T HAPPEN TO KNOW ANY WOMEN

109
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,081
THAT KNOW HOW TO PLAY POKER.

110
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,083
OH, PLEASE, THAT IS SUCH A LAME EXCUSE.

111
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,085
I MEAN, IT'S A TYPICAL GUY RESPONSE.

112
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,687
EXCUSE ME, DO ANY OF YOU KNOW HOW TO PLAY?

113
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,490
 NO.

114
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,492
BUT YOU COULD TEACH US.

115
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,093
 NO.

116
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,099
OKAY, SO NOW...

117
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,502
WE DRAW CARDS.

118
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,106
SO, I WOULDN'T NEED ANY, RIGHT?

119
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,708
BECAUSE I HAVE A STRAIGHT.

120
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,909
OH, GOOD FOR YOU!

121
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,911
CONGRATULATIONS!

122
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,913

123
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,316
OKAY, PHEEBS, HOW MANY DO YOU WANT?

124
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,117
OKAY. I JUST NEED TWO.

125
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,920
THE TEN OF SPADES AND THE SIX OF CLUBS.

00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,524
NO, PHEEBS, YOU CAN'T DO...

127
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,526
OH, WAIT, I HAVE THE TEN OF SPADES.

128
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,228
HERE, YOU WANT IT? NO, NO...

00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,832
OH, NO, NO, NO, THAT'S OKAY.

00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,434
I DON'T NEED THEM. I'M GOING FOR FOURS.

00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,235

00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,850
WE GOT SALMON ROULETTES AND ASSORTED CRUDITES.

139
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,052
WHOA, WHOA, MONICA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

140
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,654
THIS IS A POKER GAME.

141
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,255
YOU CAN'T SERVE FOOD

142
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,257
WITH MORE THAN ONE SYLLABLE.

143
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,861
IT'S GOT TO BE LIKE CHIPS, OR DIP, OR PRETZ...

144
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,664
WELL, I HOPE YOU'LL LET IT SLIDE JUST THIS ONCE.

145
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,066
YOU SEE, I WAS ALL OUT OF PRETZ.

146
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,670
OKAY, SO AT THIS POINT, THE DEALER...

147
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,672
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW, WE GOT IT, WE GOT IT.

00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,674
LET'S PLAY FOR REAL. HIGH STAKES, BIG BUCKS.

00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,275
ALL RIGHT, NOW, YOU'RE SURE?

150
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,277
PHOEBE JUST THREW AWAY TWO JACKS

151
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,279
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T LOOK HAPPY.

152
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:26,586
BUT I'M READY, SO JUST DEAL.

153
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,588

00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:33,793
EIGHT, THREE.

158
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,201
DAMM IT! DAMM IT! DAMM IT!

YES?

162
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,008
DOWNRIGHT GUTSY.

163
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,209
YEAH.

164
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,014
I SEE. SO THEN, UM, YOU WERE LYING.

165
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:55,815
ABOUT WHAT?

166
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,417
ABOUT HOW GOOD YOUR CARDS WERE.

167
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,118
I WAS BLUFFING.

168
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,319
UH HUH.

169
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,321
AND WHAT IS BLUFFING?

170
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:07,527
IS IT NOT ANOTHER WORD FOR LYING?

171
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,128
OKAY. SORRY TO BREAK UP

172
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:12,131
THIS PARTY, BUT I'VE GOT TO GO FAX A BUNCH OF RESUMES...

173
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,332
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,934

00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,843
KING GEORGE IS GIVING US THE LAND...

179
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,848
THE GAME, RACHEL, THE GAME.

180
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,850
YOU OWE US MONEY FOR THE GAME.

181
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,251
OH. RIGHT.

182
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,853
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU GUYS, IT'S THEIR FIRST TIME.

183
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,455
WHY DON'T WE JUST FORGET ABOUT THE MONEY.

184
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,857
HELL, NO, WE'LL PAY.

185
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:42,662
OKAY, MONICA, I HAD ANOTHER ANSWER ALL READY.

186
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:43,863
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

187
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,465
WE WANT A REMATCH.

188
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,467
WELL, THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

189
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,869
COULD USE THE MONEY.

190
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:53,673
OH, YOU REALLY ARE ENJOYING THIS, AREN'T YOU?

191
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,476
WELL... YEAH, I AM.

192
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,478
SO BASICALLY, YOU GET YOUR YA YAS

193
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,880
BY TAKING MONEY FROM ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS.

194
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,482
YEAH.

195
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,884
YES, AND I GET MY YA YAS FROM IKEA.

196
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,988
YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM TOGETHER YOURSELF

197
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,189
BUT THEY COST

198
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,591
A LITTLE LESS.

199
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,593
LOOK, RACH, THIS IS POKER.

200
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:14,594
I PLAY TO WIN, ALL RIGHT?

201
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,396
AND IN ORDER FOR ME TO WIN, OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO LOSE.

202
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,799
SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY POKER WITH ME

203
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,400
DON'T EXPECT ME TO BE A NICE GUY.

204
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,603
OKAY, BECAUSE ONCE THOSE CARDS ARE DEALT...

205
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,614
YEAH?

206
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:41,020
I'M NOT A NICE GUY.

207
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,328
ALL RIGHT, BOYS, LET'S EAT.

208
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,930
OH, DID YOU GET THAT

209
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,332
FROM THE "I LOVE RACHEL" PIZZERIA?

210
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,433
YOU STILL ON THAT?

211
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:58,037
COME ON, WHAT WAS WITH THAT WHOLE BLACK BART SPEECH?

212
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,840
"WHEN I PLAY POKER, I'M NOT A NICE GUY."

213
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,242
YOU ARE WAY OFF, PAL.

214
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,944
NO, I DON'T THINK SO, SEE, ROSS

215
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,946
BECAUSE I THINK YOU LOVE HER.

216
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,447
UH, NO.

217
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,250
SEE, I MIGHT HAVE HAD FEELINGS FOR HER AT ONE TIME...

218
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,451
NOT ANYMORE.

219
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,653

220
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,154
MARCEL!

221
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,557
WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THAT DISK?

222
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,859
YOU ARE NOT PUTTING THAT ON AGAIN.

223
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,562
MARCEL, OKAY, IF YOU PRESS THAT BUTTON, YOU ARE IN VERY

224
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,963
VERY BIG TROUBLE.

225
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,866

226
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,080
? A WEEM AWAY, A WEEM AWAY ?

227
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,082
? A WEEM AWAY, A WEEM AWAY ?

228
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,084
? A WEEM AWAY, A WEEM AWAY ?

229
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,086
? A WEEM AWAY, A WEEM AWAY ?

230
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,088
? A WEEM AWAY, A WEEM AWAY ?

231
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,090
? A WEEM AWAY, A WEEM AWAY ?

232
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,492
? A WEEM AWAY, A WEEM AWAY... ?

233
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:57,396
DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT A JERK ROSS WAS BEING?

234
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,998
YEAH, I KNOW.

235
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,000
HE CAN GET REALLY COMPETITIVE.

236
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,602

237
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,203
WHAT?

238
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,504
HELLO, KETTLE?

239
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,106
THIS IS MONICA.

240
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,708
YOU'RE BLACK.

241
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,710
PLEASE.

242
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,915
I AM NOT AS BAD AS ROSS.

243
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,617
OH, I BEG TO DIFFER.

244
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,218
THE PICTIONARY INCIDENT.

245
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,621
THAT WAS NOT AN INCIDENT.

246
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,222
I WAS GESTURING

247
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:26,425
AND THE PLATE SLIPPED OUT OF MY HAND.

248
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:27,827
OH...

249
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,030
OH! I GOT AN INTERVIEW!

250
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,131
YOU'RE KIDDING.

251
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,733
I GOT AN INTERVIEW! WHERE?

252
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,535
SAKS FIFTH AVENUE.

253
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,537
OH, RACHEL.

254
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:42,041
IT'S LIKE THE MOTHER SHIP IS CALLING YOU HOME.

255
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,246
WHAT'S THE JOB?

256
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,948
ASSISTANT BUYER.

257
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,149
OH!

258
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:53,352
I WOULD BE SHOPPING...

259
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,954
FOR A LIVING!

260
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,555

261
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,157
OKAY, LOOK, THAT IS AUNT IRIS.

262
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,159
THIS WOMAN HAS BEEN PLAYING POKER

263
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,761
SINCE SHE WAS FIVE.

264
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,563
YOU GOT TO LISTEN TO EVERY WORD SHE SAYS.

265
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,966
HI. IS TONY RANDALL DEAD?

266
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:07,466
NO.

267
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:08,267
I DON'T THINK SO.

268
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:09,468
WELL, HE MAY BE NOW

269
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,771
BECAUSE I THINK I HIT HIM WITH MY CAR.

270
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:12,571
REALLY?!

271
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:13,773
NO. THAT'S BLUFFING--

272
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:14,974
LESSON NUMBER ONE.

273
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,275
LISTEN

274
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,678
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

275
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,080
EVERYTHING YOU HEAR AT A POKER GAME

276
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,281
IS PURE CRAP.

277
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,883
NICE EARRINGS.

278
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,484
THANK YO...

279
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,988
GIRLS, SIT DOWN.

280
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,390
UM, AUNT IRIS, THIS IS PHOEBE, AND THAT'S...

281
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,193
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. LISTEN, I AM PARKED AT A METER.

282
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,595
LET'S DO IT, OKAY?

283
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:39,699
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO START WITH A LITTLE FIVE CARD DRAW

284
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,501
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO THE STUDS AND THE HOLD EMS

285
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,503
AND I TAUGHT YOUR COUSIN NATHAN YESTERDAY.

286
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,304
AH!

287
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,105

288
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,306
DON'T TOUCH YOUR CARDS

289
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,507
WHEN SOMEBODY'S DEALING.

290
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,715
SO, HOW IS NATHAN?

291
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,615
HOW IS HE EVER?

292
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,418
NOW HE THINKS HE'S A MAN TRAPPED IN A WOMAN'S BODY.

293
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,621
DON'T YOU MEAN HE THINKS HE'S A WOMAN TRAPPED IN A MAN'S BODY?

294
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,223
IT SHOULD BE SO SIMPLE.

295
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:10,529

296
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:19,238
ROSS, COULD WE PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, LISTEN TO ANYTHING ELSE?

297
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,840
ALL RIGHT.

298
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,150

299
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:39,658
I'M GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TONIGHT.

300
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,263

301
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,464
HI. HEY.

302
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,466
GUYS, GUESS WHAT? GUESS WHAT?

303
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,769
OKAY. THE FIFTH DENTIST CAVED

304
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,571
AND NOW THEY'RE ALL RECOMMENDING TRIDENT?

305
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,780
NO, THE INTERVIEW!

306
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,081
UNBELIEVABLE! SHE LOVED ME.

307
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,682
SHE ABSOLUTELY LOVED ME.

308
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,684
WE TALKED FOR LIKE TWO AND A HALF HOURS.

309
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,087
WE HAVE THE SAME TASTE IN CLOTHES.

310
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,289
OH, AND I WENT TO CAMP WITH HER COUSIN.

311
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,891
AND, OH, THE JOB IS PERFECT.

312
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,893
I CAN DO THIS. I CAN DO THIS WELL.

313
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,996
OH! AND THEN SHE TOLD THE FUNNIEST STORY.

314
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,799
GREAT. YOU'LL TELL US AND WE'LL LAUGH.

315
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,599
LET'S PLAY POKER.

316
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,203
ALL RIGHT, NOW, LISTEN, YOU GUYS, WE TALKED ABOUT IT

317
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,805
AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY

318
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,807
WE'D COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

319
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,809
OH, YES, YES. WE COULD PLAY SOME OTHER GAME

320
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,811
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, PICTIONARY?

321
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,613
VERY FUNNY, VERY FUNNY.

322
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:37,216
BUT I THINK WE'D LIKE TO GIVE POKER ANOTHER TRY.

323
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,818
SHALL WE, LADIES?

324
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,219
 YES, I THINK WE SHOULD.

325
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,221
UH, RACH, DO YOU WANT ME TO SHUFFLE THOSE?

326
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,122
NO, NO. THAT'S OKAY.

327
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,124
I THINK I'M GOING TO GIVE IT A GO.

328
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,325
ALL RIGHT...

329
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,726
UM...

330
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:58,037
SO, PHEEBS OWES 7.50, MONICA, YOU OWE TEN DOLLARS

331
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,238
AND, RACHEL, YOU OWE

332
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,240
15 BIG ONES.

333
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,341
AND, HEY

334
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,742
THANKS FOR TEACHING US

335
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:04,944
CROSS EYED MARY.

336
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,545
WE GOT TO PLAY THAT

337
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:07,847
AT OUR REGULAR GAME.

338
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,448
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S MY SEVEN FIFTY,

339
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,251
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THIS MONEY IS CURSED.

340
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,252
WHAT?

341
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,354
OH, I CURSED IT.

342
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:19,358
SO NOW BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN TO HE WHO SPENDS IT.

343
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,160
AH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE IT.

344
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,162
BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO ME ANYWAY.

345
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,765
THIS WAY I CAN SPLIT THEM UP WITH A MOVIE.

346
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:30,769
SO THAT JUST LEAVES THE BIG, GREEN POKER MACHINE

347
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,371
WHO OWES 15.

348
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:36,275
COULD YOU BE ANY SMUGGER?

349
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,877
HUH, LET'S SEE.

350
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,080
UM... SAY, RACH, I'M OPENING UP A NEW ART GALLERY

351
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,681
AND I COULD SURE USE

352
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,484
THE PORTRAITS OF LINCOLN AND HAMILTON.

353
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,786
HMM... OH, IT'S SO TYPICAL.

354
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:48,988
OOH, I'M A MAN.

355
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,589
OOH, I HAVE A PENIS.

356
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,792
OOH, I HAVE TO WIN MONEY TO EXERT MY POWER

357
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,294
OVER WOMEN.

358
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,099
YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS NOT OVER.

359
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,401
WE WILL PLAY YOU AGAIN, AND WE WILL WIN

360
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,602
AND YOU WILL LOSE

361
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,404
AND YOU WILL BEG, AND WE WILL LAUGH

362
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,607
AND WE WILL TAKE EVERY LAST DIME YOU HAVE

363
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,810
AND YOU WILL HATE YOURSELVES FOREVER.

364
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,215
HMM. YOU KIND OF STEPPED ON MY POINT THERE, MON.

365
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,316
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU LOST.

366
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,918
HOW MUCH DID THEY TAKE FROM YOU?

367

552
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,234
OH!

553
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,238
THAT'S ALL RIGHT. THAT'S A TOUGH HAND TO BEAT.

554
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,039
I THOUGHT WE HAD THEM.

555
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,041
WELL, WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE CARDS

556
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,643
YOU DON'T HAVE THE CARDS, YOU KNOW?

557
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,645
BUT LOOK HOW HAPPY SHE IS.

558
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:20,559
FINGERNAIL. AIRPLANE. AIRPORT.

559
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,961
AIRPORT 75! AIRPORT 77!

560
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,162
AIRPORT 79!

561
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,163

562
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,364
UH! TIME'S UP.

563
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,167
BYE, BYE... BIRDIE!

564
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,669
WHAT?

565
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:31,870
THAT'S A BIRD?

566
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:36,174
THAT'S A BIRD.

567
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:38,777
 OKAY, OKAY, IT'S MY TURN.

568
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,679
GO.

569
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:44,883
UH, BEAN.

570
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,785
BEAN.

571
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,488
THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING!

572
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,388
YES!

573
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:51,389
THAT'S IT!

574
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:52,991
YES!

575
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,493
THAT YOU GET?

576
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,094
THAT YOU GET?
