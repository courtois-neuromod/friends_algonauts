1
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:03,603
WOULD YOU LET IT GO?

2
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:04,804
IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

3
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:06,806
NOT THAT BIG A DEAL? IT'S AMAZING, OKAY?

4
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:09,209
YOU JUST REACH IN THERE, THERE'S ONE LITTLE MANEUVER

5
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,211
AND BAM, A BRA, RIGHT OUT THE SLEEVE.

6
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:13,113
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED

7
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:15,315
THERE IS NOTHING A GUY CAN DO THAT EVEN COMES CLOSE.

8
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:16,516
AM I RIGHT HERE?

9
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,617
 OH, COME ON!

10
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,919
YOU GUYS CAN PEE STANDING UP.

11
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:22,322
WE CAN? OKAY, I'M TRYING THAT.

12
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,026
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT BLOWS MY MIND?

13
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,828
WOMEN CAN SEE BREASTS ANYTIME THEY WANT.

14
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,233
YOU JUST LOOK DOWN, AND THERE THEY ARE.

15
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,235
HOW YOU GET ANY WORK DONE IS BEYOND ME.

16
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,139
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T GET?

17
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,541
THE WAY GUYS CAN DO SO MANY MEAN THINGS

18
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,742
AND THEN NOT EVEN CARE.

19
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:50,650
MULTIPLE ORGASMS.

20
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,453
 THERE YOU GO.

34
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,107
SO, SATURDAY NIGHT, THE BIG NIGHT

35
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:51,611
DATE NIGHT, SATURDAY NIGHT, SA TUR DAY NIGHT!

36
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,613
NO PLANS, HUH?

37
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,115
NOT A ONE.

38
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,118
NOT EVEN, SAY, BREAKING UP WITH JANICE?

39
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,519
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT.

40
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,720
SHUT UP.

41
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,724
CHANDLER, NOBODY LIKES BREAKING UP WITH SOMEONE.

42
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,026
EXCEPT FOR KEVIN MILMORE, MAY HE ROT IN HELL.

43
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,628
YOU JUST GOT TO DO IT.

44
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,630
I KNOW, BUT IT'S JUST SO HARD, YOU KNOW?

45
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,834
I MEAN, YOU'RE SITTING THERE WITH HER.

46
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,836
SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT'S HAPPENING.

47
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,938
THEN YOU FINALLY GET UP THE COURAGE TO DO IT

48
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,940
AND THERE'S THAT HORRIBLE AWKWARD MOMENT

49
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,942
WHEN YOU'VE HANDED HER THE NOTE...

50
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,348
YOU TRY TO, YOU KNOW, RUN OUT OF THE RESTAURANT

51
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,750
BEFORE SHE'S ACTUALLY FINISHED THE NOTE.

52
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,453
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BREAK UP WITH HER?

53
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:34,654
BE A MAN.

54
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:35,855
JUST STOP CALLING.

55
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,560
IF YOU WANT, I'LL DO IT WITH YOU.

56
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,563
THANKS, BUT I THINK SHE'D FEEL LIKE WE'RE GANGING UP ON HER.

57
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,665
NO, I MEAN, YOU BREAK UP WITH JANICE

58
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,267
AND I'LL BREAK UP WITH TONY.

59
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,768
YOU'RE BREAKING UP WITH TONY?

60
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,071
YEAH, I KNOW HE'S SWEET, BUT IT'S JUST NOT FUN ANYMORE.

61
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,275
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ME OR HIS HUNGER STRIKE, OR...

62
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,578
DOES ANYBODY WANT ANYTHING ELSE?

63
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,779
OH, YEAH.

64
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,381
LAST WEEK YOU HAD A WONDERFUL

65
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:04,184
NUTTY, CHOCOLATY KIND OF A CAKEY PIE THING...

66
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,387
NOTHING. JUST, JUST... I'M FINE.

67
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:10,690
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

68
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,891
WHY SO SCRUNCHY?

69
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:12,892
OH, IT'S MY FATHER.

70
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,295
HE WANTS TO GIVE ME A MERCEDES CONVERTIBLE.

71
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:19,799
THAT GUY... HE BURNS ME UP.

72
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,403
YEAH, WELL, IT'S A MERCEDES IF I MOVE BACK HOME.

73
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,604
UGH, IT'S HORRIBLE!

74
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,206
HE CALLED ME "YOUNG LADY."

75
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,608
OOH, I HATE WHEN MY FATHER CALLS ME THAT.

76
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,809
DID HE GIVE YOU

77
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,712
THAT WHOLE "YOU'RE NOT UP TO THIS" THING AGAIN?

78
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,215
OH, YEAH, YEAH. I ACTUALLY GOT THE EXTENDED DISCO VERSION

79
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,818
WITH THREE CHORUSES OF "YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN."

80
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,820
? UH HUH, UH HUH. ?

81
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,024
HI, JOEY.

82
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,827
OH, MY GOD-- ANGELA.

83
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:51,130
WOW. BEING DUMPED BY YOU OBVIOUSLY AGREES WITH HER.

84
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,333
ARE YOU GOING TO GO OVER THERE?

85
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,935
NO. YEAH. NO.

86
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,136
OKAY, BUT NOT YET.

87
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:59,138
I DON'T WANT TO SEEM TOO EAGER.

88
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,644
ONE MISSISSIPPI, TWO MISSISSIPPI

89
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,847
THREE MISSISSIPPI... THAT SEEMS PRETTY COOL.

90
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,652
HEY, ANGELA.

91
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,654
JOEY.

92
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,256
YOU LOOK GOOD.

93
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,358
THAT'S BECAUSE I'M WEARING A DRESS

94
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,559
THAT ACCENTS MY BOOBS.

95
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,368
YOU DON'T SAY.

96
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,170
SO, RACHEL, WHAT ARE YOU...

97
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,772
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?

98
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,274
OH, BIG GLAMOUR NIGHT

99
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,276
ME AND MONICA AT LAUNDERAMA.

100
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,078
OH. YOU, UH...

101
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,481
YOU WANT TO HEAR A FREAKISH COINCIDENCE?

102
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,483
GUESS WHO'S DOING LAUNDRY THERE TOO?

103
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,684
WHO?

104
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,286
ME.

105
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,288
WAS THAT NOT CLEAR?

106
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,092
UH, HEY, WHY DON'T, UH...

107
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,495
WHY DON'T I JUST JOIN YOU... BOTH... THERE?

108
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,897
DON'T YOU HAVE A LAUNDRY ROOM IN YOUR BUILDING?

109
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,302
YES.

110
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,505
I DO HAVE A LAUNDRY ROOM IN MY BUILDING.

111
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,310
UH, BUT THERE'S A RAT PROBLEM.

112
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,913
APPARENTLY, THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO THE DRYER SHEETS

113
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,515
AND THEY'RE GOING IN FINE

114
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,116
BUT THEY'RE COMING OUT ALL...

115
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,118
FLUFFY.

116
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,222
ANYWAY, SAY, SEVEN ISH?

117
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,524
SURE.

118
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,428
FORGET IT, JOEY.

119
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,629
I'M WITH BOB NOW.

120
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,230
BOB? MM HMM.

121
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,432
WHO THE HELL'S BOB?

122
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,633
BOB IS GREAT.

123
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,234
HE'S SMART, HE'S SOPHISTICATED

124
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,836
AND HE HAS A REAL JOB.

125
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,238
YOU, YOU GO ON THREE AUDITIONS A MONTH

126
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,840
AND YOU CALL YOURSELF AN ACTOR

127
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,041
BUT BOB...

128
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,242
COME ON.

129
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,844
WE WERE GREAT TOGETHER

130
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,946
AND NOT JUST AT THE FUN STUFF

131
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,548
BUT, LIKE, TALKING TOO.

132
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,151
YEAH...

133
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,753
YEAH, WELL, SORRY, JOEY.

134
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,755
YOU SAID "LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS"

135
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:56,556
SO GUESS WHAT?

136
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,157
WHAT?

137
00:05:58,157 --> 00:05:59,359
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

138
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,761
FINE. FINE. SO, WHY DON'T THE FOUR OF US

139
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,163
GO OUT AND HAVE DINNER TOGETHER TONIGHT--

140
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,365
YOU KNOW, AS FRIENDS?

00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,966
WHAT FOUR OF US?

I'M TELLING YOU

146
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,275
THIS GUY IS PERFECT FOR YOU.

147
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:17,477
FORGET IT.

148
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,078
NOT AFTER YOUR COUSIN

149
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,680
WHO COULD BELCH THE ALPHABET.

150
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,781
COME ON.

151
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:22,982
THIS GUY'S GREAT.

152
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,183
HIS NAME'S BOB.

00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,185

154
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,187
HE'S SMART, HE'S

00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,590
SOPHISTICATED, AND HE HAS A REAL JOB.

156
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,992
ME, I GO ON THREE AUDITIONS A MONTH

157
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,395

00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,596
OH, GOD HELP US.

159
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:37,797
WHAT?

160
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,799
UGLY NAKED GUYS LAYING KITCHEN TILE.

161
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:43,403
EEW! EEW!

162
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,204
LOOK, I'M ASKING A FAVOR HERE.

163
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:46,406
YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING

164
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,808
IF I DO THIS THING FOR HER BROTHER

165
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,810
MAYBE ANGELA WILL COME BACK TO ME.

166
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,712
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

167
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,714
YOU GO OUT WITH TONS OF GIRLS.

168
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:55,915
I KNOW, BUT...

169
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:00,720
SHE'S ONE OF A KIND, YOU KNOW?

170
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,523
LIKE A SNOWFLAKE, OR...

171
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,624
OR A...

172
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,026
SOMETHING ELSE LIKE A SNOWFLAKE?

173
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,227
YEAH. YEAH.

174
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,630
LOOK, I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE.

175
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,833
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE BROKE UP WITH HER.

176
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,835
WILL YOU HELP ME? PLEASE?

177
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:24,844
HOLD ON A SEC.

178
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,446
YOU NEED TO NOT TOUCH ANY OF THOSE.

179
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,649
OKAY. BYE.

180
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,350
WELL, MONICA'S NOT COMING.

181
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,352
IT'S JUST GOING TO BE ME AND RACHEL.

182
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,554

183
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,155
WELL, HOLD ON THERE, CAMPER.

184
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:39,759
YOU SURE YOU'VE THOUGHT THIS THROUGH?

185
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,960
IT'S LAUNDRY.

186
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,362
THE THINKING THROUGH IS PRETTY MINIMAL.

187
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,065
SEE, IT'S JUST YOU AND RACHEL, JUST THE TWO OF YOU?

188
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,266
THIS IS A DATE.

189
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,868
YOU'RE GOING ON A DATE.

190
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,472
NUH UH.

191
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,274
YUH HUH.

192
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,478
YEAH, I HAVEN'T DONE THAT IN A WHILE.

193
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,280
IS IT A DATE IF SHE DOESN'T KNOW WE'RE GOING ON A DATE?

194
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,482
YES. ABSOLUTELY.

195
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,284
SATURDAY NIGHT, ALL RULES APPLY.

00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,690
I SHOULD SHAVE AGAIN, PICK UP SOME WINE? WHAT?

198
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,991
WELL, YOU, UH, MAY WANT

199
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,993
TO RETHINK THE DIRTY UNDERWEAR.

200
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,595
THIS IS BASICALLY THE FIRST TIME

201
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,597
SHE'S GOING TO SEE YOUR UNDERWEAR.

202
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,798
DO YOU WANT IT

203
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,200
TO BE DIRTY?

204
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,804
NO.

205
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,908
OH, AND, UH, THE FABRIC SOFTENER?

206
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,711
OKAY, OKAY, NOW, WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY SNUGGLES?

207
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:37,316
IT, WHAT? IT SAYS I'M A SENSITIVE, WARM KIND OF GUY

208
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,520
YOU KNOW, LIKE A LITTLE FUZZY BEAR.

209
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,322
ALL RIGHT, I CAN PICK SOMETHING ELSE UP...

210
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,624
THERE YOU GO.

211
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,029
THANK YOU.

00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,431
SO, WHAT DOES THIS BOB GUY LOOK LIKE?

213
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,633
IS HE TALL, SHORT?

214
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,135
YUP.

215
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,236
WHICH?

216
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,338
WHICH WHAT?

217
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:02,642
YOU'VE NEVER MET BOB, HAVE YOU?

00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,243

00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,144
OH, MY GOD, JOEY

220
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,746
THIS GUY COULD BE HORRIBLY...

221
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,548
HEY, JOEY!

222
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,749
HORRIBLY ATTRACTIVE.

223
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,751
I'LL BE SHUTTING UP NOW.

224
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,957
WHERE ARE THEY?

225
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,158
WHERE ARE THEY?

226
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,359
THIS IS NICE.

227
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:23,462
WE NEVER DO ANYTHING JUST THE TWO OF US.

228
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:24,664
IT'S GREAT.

229
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,666
MAYBE TOMORROW WE CAN RENT A CAR

230
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,267
RUN OVER SOME PUPPIES.

231
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,468
EW. I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

232
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,372
HERE WE GO.

233
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,974
OKAY, HAVE A GOOD BREAK UP.

234
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:37,677
HEY, JANICE.

235
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:38,878
OH, MY GOD

236
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,479
I AM SO GLAD YOU CALLED ME.

237
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,883
I HAD THE MOST SUPREMELY AWFUL DAY.

238
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,485
HEY, THAT'S NOT GOOD.

239
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,089
CAN I GET AN ESPRESSO AND A LATTE OVER HERE, PLEASE?

240
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,892
WE GOT THE PROOFS BACK FROM THAT PHOTO SHOOT--

241
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,894
YOU KNOW, THE ONE WITH THE LITTLE VEGETABLES--

242
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,095
THEY PRETTY MUCH SUCKED

243
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,497
SO I BLEW OFF THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON.

244
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:01,601
I WENT SHOPPING, AND I GOT YOU...

245
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,804

246
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,306
I'M LOOKING...

247
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,507
I GOT YOU...

248
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:09,709

249
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:10,910
WHAT?

250
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,713
WHAT... DID YOU GET ME THERE?

251
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,115
I GOT YOU...

252
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,117
THESE.

253
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,519
BULLWINKLE SOCKS.

254
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,821
THAT'S SO SWEET.

255
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,422
WELL, I KNEW YOU HAD THE ROCKYS

256
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,024
AND SO I FIGURED, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD WEAR

257
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,827
BULLWINKLE AND BULLWINKLE, OR YOU COULD WEAR ROCKY AND ROCKY

258
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,028
OR YOU CAN MIX AND MATCH.

259
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,030
MOOSE AND SQUIRREL.

260
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,632
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

261
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,638
WELL, I'M GOING TO GET ANOTHER ESPRESSO.

262
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,839
MORE LATTE?

263
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,245
NO... NO, I I'M, I'M STILL WORKING ON MINE.

264
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,247

265
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,851
THAT'S IT?

266
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,452
YEAH, IT WAS REALLY HARD.

267
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,855
OH, YEAH, THE HUG LOOKED PRETTY BRUTAL.

268
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,456
OKAY, YOU WEREN'T THERE.

269
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,261
SORRY.

270
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,664
HOW'S IT GOING WITH JANICE?

271
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,865
THINGS ARE NOT GOING.

272
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,066
SHE GOT ME SOCKS.

273
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,468
OH, THESE GO WITH YOUR ROCKYS.

274
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:12,271
OH, MY GOD, SHE MUST REALLY CARE ABOUT YOU

275
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,272
I'M SORRY.

276
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,187
 COMING THROUGH. MOVE, MOVE.

277
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,193
OH, EXCUSE ME.

278
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,996
I WAS KIND OF USING THAT MACHINE.

279
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,799
YEAH, WELL, NOW YOU'RE KIND OF NOT.

280
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,000
BUT, I I SAVED IT.

281
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,002
I I PUT MY BASKET ON TOP.

282
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,404
OH, I'M SORRY, IS THAT YOUR BASKET?

283
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,605
YES.

284
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:47,707
IT'S REALLY PRETTY.

285
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,709
UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T SEE SUDS!

286
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,312
WHAT?

287
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:57,717
NO SUDS, NO SAVE. OKAY?

288
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,721
WHAT'S GOING ON?

289
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,922
HI. UH, NOTHING.

290
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,125
THIS HORRIBLE WOMAN JUST TOOK MY MACHINE.

291
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,727
WAS YOUR BASKET ON TOP?

292
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,328
YEAH, BUT THERE WERE NO SUDS.

293
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,129
SO?

294
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,131
WELL, YOU KNOW, "NO SUDS, NO SAVE."

295
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,333
NO SUDS, NO..? EXCUSE ME.

296
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,935
HOLD ON A SECOND.

297
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,337
THIS IS MY FRIEND'S MACHINE.

298
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,740
HEY, HEY, HEY, HER STUFF WASN'T IN IT.

299
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,642
HEY, HEY, HEY, THAT'S NOT THE RULE

300
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,244
AND YOU KNOW IT.

301
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,156
ALL RIGHT, SHOW'S OVER.

302
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,261
NOTHING TO SEE HERE.

303
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,265
OKAY, LET'S DO LAUNDRY.

304
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,867
THAT WAS AMAZING.

305
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,068
WELL...

306
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,470
I CAN'T EVEN SEND BACK SOUP.

307
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,675
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A SWEET, GENTLE, UH...

308
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,879
UM, UH, DO YOU, UH, OH, HEY

309
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,081
YOU MUST NEED DETERGENT. OH!

310
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,185
WHAT'S THAT?

311
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:09,789
UBERWEISS. IT'S NEW, IT'S GERMAN

312
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,791
IT'S EXTRA TOUGH.

313
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,195
RACH, ARE YOU GOING TO SEPARATE THOSE?

314
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:18,597
OH, GOD. OH!

315
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,400
AM I BEING, LIKE A TOTAL LAUNDRY SPAZ?

316
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,603
I MEAN, AM I SUPPOSED TO USE ONE MACHINE FOR SHIRTS

317
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:26,605
AND ANOTHER MACHINE FOR PANTS?

318
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,010
HAVE YOU..?

319
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,012
HAVE YOU NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE?

320
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,213
WELL, NOT MYSELF

321
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,615
BUT I KNOW OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE.

322
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,418
OKAY, YOU CAUGHT ME.

323
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,821
I'M A LAUNDRY VIRGIN.

324
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:46,225
UH, WELL, DON'T WORRY, I'LL USE THE GENTLE CYCLE.

325
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,629
OKAY, UH...

326
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:54,033
BASICALLY, YOU WANT TO USE ONE MACHINE

327
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,035
FOR ALL YOUR WHITES, OKAY?

328
00:13:56,035 --> 00:14:00,039
A WHOLE NOTHER MACHINE FOR, FOR YOUR COLORS

329
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,842
AND, AND A THIRD FOR YOUR, UH...

330
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,644
UH... DELICATES, AND THAT WOULD BE

331
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:09,248
YOUR BRAS AND YOUR UNDER... PANTY THINGS.

332
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,051
OKAY, WELL, WHAT ABOUT...

333
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,053
THESE ARE WHITE COTTON PANTIES.

334
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,654
WOULD THEY GO WITH WHITES

335
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:16,856
OR WITH DELICATES?

336
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,057
UH, THAT, THAT...

337
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,059
THAT WOULD BE A JUDGMENT CALL.

338
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,263

339
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,966
HE'S SO CUTE.

340
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,569
SO, WHERE DID YOU GUYS GROW UP?

341
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,171
BROOKLYN HEIGHTS. CLEVELAND.

342
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,772
HA.

343
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,374
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

344
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,175
OH, MY GOD!

345
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,277
WHAT?

346
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,279
I, UH, SUDDENLY HAD THE FEELING

347
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,281
I WAS... FALLING.

348
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,084
BUT I'M NOT.

349
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,994
SO, YOU AND ANGELA, HUH?

350
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,396
YEP. PRETTY MUCH.

351
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,998
YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN.

352
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,199
YEAH.

353
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,601
YOU KNOW WHAT I MISS THE MOST ABOUT HER?

354
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:06,205
THAT CUTE NIBBLY NOISE SHE MAKES WHEN SHE EATS

355
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:09,808
LIKE A HAPPY LITTLE SQUIRREL OR...

356
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,410
OR A WEASEL.

357
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,114
I... I NEVER REALLY NOTICED.

358
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,215
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

359
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,816
LISTEN FOR IT.

360
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,218
MONICA...

361
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,819
MONICA IS GREAT.

362
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,521
YEAH. YEAH, SHE IS.

363
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,724
BUT, UH... IT'S NOT GOING TO LAST.

364
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:30,229
SHE'S TOO MUCH FOR ME IN BED.

365
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,830
SEXUALLY.

366
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,036
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU.

367
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,637
BOB IS TERRIFIC.

368
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:39,838
YEAH. ISN'T HE?

369
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:43,042
IT IS SO GREAT TO MEET A GUY WHO'S SMART AND FUNNY

370
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,844
AND HAS AN EMOTIONAL AGE BEYOND, LIKE, EIGHT.

371
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,446
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

372
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,448
HE'S UNBELIEVABLE IN BED.

373
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,651
WOW.

374
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:56,655
MY BROTHER NEVER EVEN TOLD ME WHEN HE LOST HIS VIRGINITY.

375
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,557
HUH.

376
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,960
THAT'S NICE.

377
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,166
YOU CAN DO THIS.

378
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,168
IT'S JUST LIKE PULLING OFF A BAND AID.

379
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,371
OKAY, JUST DO IT REALLY FAST AND THEN THE WOUND IS EXPOSED.

380
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,373
GO. GO.

381
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,383
JANICE...

382
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,388
HI, JANICE.

383
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,389
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

384
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,192
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD GO OUT ANYMORE.

385
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,696
JANICE.

386
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,501
ALL RIGHT.

387
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,306
WELL...

388
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,008
WELL, THERE YOU GO.

389
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,410
STOP IT. STOP IT.

390
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,011
STOP IT.

391
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,416
LISTEN, JANICE, THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.

392
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,617
OH, I KNOW THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME.

393
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:01,020
THIS IS TOTALLY ABOUT YOUR FEAR OF COMMITMENT.

394
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,721
WHAT FEAR OF COMMITMENT? I DON'T HAVE A FEAR OF COMMITMENT.

395
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,423
OH, PLEASE. I DON'T.

396
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,425
OH, PLEASE. I DON'T! I'M READY TO COMMIT ANYTIME.

397
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,128
REALLY?

398
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:12,231
OKAY. I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO SOUND REALLY STUPID

399
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:15,434
BUT I FEEL... I FEEL THAT IF I CAN DO THIS...

400
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,237
YOU KNOW, IF I CAN ACTUALLY DO MY OWN LAUNDRY

401
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,239
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING I CAN'T DO.

402
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,941
THAT DOES NOT SOUND STUPID TO ME.

403
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,543
NO. IT'S LIKE THE... OKAY, THE FIRST TIME

404
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,047
I HAD TO MAKE DINNER FOR MYSELF AFTER CAROL LEFT ME.

405
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,849
 I'M SORRY. THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE.

406
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,051
NEXT, ON ROSS...

407
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,652
OKAY.

408
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,054
UH OH.

409
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,255
WHAT "UH OH"?

410
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,057
UH OH...

411
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,658
UH OH... THE LAUNDRY'S DONE.

412
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:43,662
IT'S A... IT'S A SONG.

413
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,065
THE LAUNDRY SONG THAT WE SING.

414
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:50,469
? UH OH, THE LAUNDRY'S DONE ?

415
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,071
? UH OH, UH OH... ? ROSS, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

416
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,472
NOTHING. NOTHING.

417
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,074
? LEE LO, THE LAUNDRY'S DONE. ?

418
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,275
COME ON. SHOW ME. ALL RIGHT

419
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,777
ALL RIGHT, IT'S JUST THAT YOU LEFT A RED SOCK IN

420
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,779
WITH ALL YOUR WHITES

421
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,182
AND NOW...

422
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,783
EVERYTHING'S KIND OF PINK.

423
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,186
OH. EVERYTHING'S PINK.

424
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,387
YEAH.

425
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,789
EXCEPT FOR THE RED SOCK, WHICH IS STILL RED.

426
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,391
I'M SORRY. PLEASE DON'T BE UPSET.

427
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,293
IT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE, RACH.

428
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,695
OH, BUT IT DIDN'T. IT HAPPENED TO ME.

429
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:19,898
GOD! I'M GOING TO LOOK LIKE A BIG MARSHMALLOW PEEP.

430
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,701
WHAT AM I DOING? WHAT AM I DOING?

431
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:23,902
MY FATHER'S RIGHT.

432
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,904
I CAN'T LIVE ON MY OWN.

433
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,906
I CAN'T EVEN DO LAUNDRY.

434
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,311

435
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,515

436
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,420
SOMETHING WENT WRONG WITH UNDERDOG

437
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,623
AND THEY COULDN'T GET HIS HEAD TO INFLATE

438
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:48,227
SO, ANYWAY, UM...

439
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,430
HIS HEAD IS, LIKE, FLOPPING DOWN BROADWAY, RIGHT?

440
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,732
AND I'M JUST THINKING...

441
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,735
HOW INAPPROPRIATE THIS IS.

442
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,138
UM... I'VE GOT SOMETHING IN MY EYE.

443
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,340
JOEY, COULD WE CHECK IT IN THE LIGHT, PLEASE?

444
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:05,744
OH, MY GOD.

445
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:06,945
WHAT?

446
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:07,846
HELLO?!

447
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,848
WERE WE AT THE SAME TABLE?

448
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,251
IT'S LIKE COCKTAILS IN APPALACHIA.

449
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:17,756
COME ON. THEY'RE CLOSE.

450
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:18,657
CLOSE?

451
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,059
SHE'S GOT HER TONGUE IN HIS EAR.

452
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:25,864
OH. LIKE YOU'VE NEVER GOTTEN A LITTLE RAMBUNCTIOUS WITH ROSS?

453
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,866
JOEY, THIS IS SICK.

454
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,468
IT'S DISGUSTING.

455
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,669
IT'S... IT'S...

456
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,872
NOT REALLY TRUE, IS IT?

457
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,174
WHO'S TO SAY WHAT'S TRUE?

458
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,375
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

459
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,077
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I'M NOT PROUD OF THIS, OKAY?

460
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,679
WELL, MAYBE I AM A LITTLE.

461
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,281
OH!

462
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,482
I'M OUT OF HERE.

463
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,083
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. COME ON.

464
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,085
YOU LIKE HIM. I WANT HER.

465
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,687
HE LIKES YOU.

466
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,289
REALLY?

467
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,490
YEAH.

468
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,293
LISTEN, I'M THINKING IF WE PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER

469
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,095
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US, WE CAN BREAK THEM UP.

470
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,200
I'M SO SORRY.

471
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,801
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS.

472
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,803
I JUST COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING

473
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,206
AT YOUR NORMAN MAILER STORY.

474
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:12,611

475
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,013
WAITER, ONE MORE PLATE OF CHICKEN WINGS OVER HERE.

476
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,322
HERE'S THE THING, JANICE.

477
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,923
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, IT'S LIKE, WE'RE DIFFERENT.

478
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,525
YOU KNOW, I'M LIKE THE BING, BING, BING.

479
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,126
YOU'RE LIKE THE BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. OW!

480
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,728
MY GOD!

481
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,929
I'M SO SORRY.

482
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,431
OW. ARE YOU OKAY?

483
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:33,232
OW.

484
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,034
IT'S JUST MY LENS. IT'S MY LENS.

485
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,636
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

486
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:38,437
OW.

487
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,440
I HIT HER IN THE EYE.

488
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,041
I HIT HER IN THE EYE!

489
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,645
THIS IS THE WORST BREAKUP IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.

490
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:48,347
OH, MY GOD.

491
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,351
HOW MANY OF THOSE HAVE YOU HAD?

492
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,552
I DON'T KNOW.

493
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:54,753
A MILLION?

494
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,355
CHANDLER, SHH.

495
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:57,556
EASY. EASY.

496
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,757
GO TO YOUR HAPPY PLACE.

497
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,359
? LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA... ?

498
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,761
I'M FINE. I'M FINE.

499
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,962
I'M FINE. ALL RIGHT.

500
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,163
I'M NOT FINE.

501
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,365
HERE SHE COMES.

502
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,966
SHH. WAIT HERE, OKAY?

503
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,568
BREATHE.

504
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,388
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

505
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,390
IT'S LIKE A GIFT.

506
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,595
WE SHOULD ALWAYS, ALWAYS BREAK UP TOGETHER.

507
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:37,796
OH, I'D LIKE THAT.

508
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,300
YOU GOT THE CLOTHES CLEAN.

509
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,901
NOW, THAT'S THE IMPORTANT PART.

510
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,503
OH, I GUESS.

511
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,905
EXCEPT EVERYTHING LOOKS LIKE JAMMIES NOW.

512
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,812
OH, I'M SORRY.

513
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,613
EXCUSE ME.

514
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,615
WE HAD THIS CART.

515
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,617
YEAH, WELL, I HAD A 24 INCH WAIST.

516
00:21:58,617 --> 00:21:59,818
YOU LOSE THINGS.

517
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,019
NOW, COME ON.

518
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,621
GET OUT OF MY WAY.

519
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,023
WELL, I'M SORRY. YOU KNOW, MAYBE I WASN'T BEING CLEAR.

520
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,625
THIS WAS OUR CART.

521
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,727
HEY, HEY, HEY! THERE WEREN'T ANY CLOTHES IN IT!

522
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,530
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY! QUIT MAKING UP RULES!

523
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,731
LET GO!

524
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,133

525
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,735
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, MITZI.

526
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:17,936
IF YOU WANT THIS CART

527
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,339
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE ME WITH IT.

528
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,146
YES.

529
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:29,348
DID YOU SEE THAT?

530
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,949
YOU WERE INCREDIBLE.

531
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,752
A BRAND NEW WOMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

532
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,154
THANK YOU. I COULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT YOU.

533
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,162
OKAY, UM... UH...

534
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:46,164
MORE CLOTHES IN THE DRYER?

535
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:49,768
I'M FINE. I'M FINE.

536
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:50,969
ARE YOU HURT?

537
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,170
NO.

538
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,975
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

539
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:57,776
YEAH.

540
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,378
DOES IT STILL HURT?

541
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,180
YEAH.

542
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,782
WHAT A NEAT IDEA.

543
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,784
ALL YOUR CLOTHES MATCH.

544
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,486
I'M GOING TO DO THIS.

545
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,087
HI.

546
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,689
HEY. HOW DID IT GO?

547
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:11,490
EXCELLENT.

548
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,592
WE RIPPED THAT COUPLE APART

549
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,395
AND KEPT THE PIECES FOR OURSELVES.

550
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,597
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL STORY.

551
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,601
HEY. I'M FINE, BY THE WAY.

552
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,403
OH, I'M...

553
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,404
HEY, WHERE'S CHANDLER?

554
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,406
HE NEEDED SOME TIME TO GRIEVE.

555
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,208
I'M FREE! I'M FREE!

556
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,112
THAT OUGHT TO DO IT.
