1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,203
WHAT YOU GUYS DON'T UNDERSTAND IS

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:05,005
FOR US, KISSING IS AS IMPORTANT

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,206
AS ANY PART OF IT.

4
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:08,208
YEAH, RIGHT.

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,911
YOU SERIOUS?

6
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:13,013
OH, YEAH.

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:13,813
EVERYTHING YOU

8
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:16,616
NEED TO KNOW IS IN THAT FIRST KISS.

9
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:17,617
ABSOLUTELY.

10
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:18,818
YEAH, I THINK FOR US

11
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:22,422
KISSING IS PRETTY MUCH LIKE AN OPENING ACT, YOU KNOW?

12
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:26,026
IT'S LIKE THE STAND UP COMEDIAN YOU HAVE TO SIT THROUGH

13
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,628
BEFORE PINK FLOYD COMES OUT.

14
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,632
YEAH, AND IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T LIKE THE COMEDIAN.

15
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:34,234
IT'S JUST THAT THAT'S...

16
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:37,037
THAT'S NOT WHY WE BOUGHT THE TICKET.

17
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:39,839
THE PROBLEM IS, THOUGH

18
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:41,441
AFTER THE CONCERT'S OVER

19
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,443
NO MATTER HOW GREAT THE SHOW WAS

20
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,045
YOU GIRLS ARE ALWAYS

21
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,047
LOOKING FOR THE COMEDIAN AGAIN.

22
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,849
I MEAN WE'RE IN THE CAR, FIGHTING TRAFFIC.

23
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,852
BASICALLY, JUST TRYING TO STAY AWAKE.

24
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:56,556
YEAH, WELL, WORD OF ADVICE--

25
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,957
BRING BACK THE COMEDIAN.

26
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,559
OTHERWISE, NEXT TIME

27
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,362
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND YOURSELF SITTING AT HOME

28
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:05,165
LISTENING TO THAT ALBUM ALONE.

29
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,868
ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT SEX?

43
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,921
 NO, IT'S GOOD.

44
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,123
IT IS GOOD.

45
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,824
IT'S JUST THAT, HMM...

46
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,826
DOESN'T SHE SEEM A LITTLE ANGRY?

47
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,428
WELL, SHE HAS ISSUES.

48
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,730
DOES SHE?

49
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,332
YOU THINK IT'S EASY

50
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,933
TRYING TO LIVE WITH MR. "HEY, I'M EVOLVING"?

51
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,935
HE'S OUT BANGING OTHER WOMEN IN THE HEAD

52
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,937
WITH A CLUB, WHILE SHE SITS AT HOME

53
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:20,340
TRYING TO GET THE MASTODON SMELL OUT OF THE CARPET.

54
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,541
OKAY, OKAY...

55
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,744
MARSHA, YOU SEE THESE ARE CAVE PEOPLE.

56
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,947
THEY HAVE ISSUES LIKE

57
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,951
"GEE, THAT GLACIER'S GETTING KIND OF CLOSE." SEE?

58
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,153
SPEAKING OF ISSUES

59
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,754
ISN'T THAT YOUR EX WIFE?

60
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:35,955
MY..? NO, NO.

61
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:36,756
YES, IT IS.

62
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,459
CAROL, HI. OKAY, YES, YES, IT IS.

63
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,162
HOW ABOUT I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU IN THE ICE AGE?

64
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,763
CAN I STAY? THAT WOULD BE NO.

65
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,978
HI.

66
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,380
HI.

67
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,888
IS THIS A BAD TIME?

68
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:10,390
NO, NO, IT'S, IT'S, IT'S...

69
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,991
THE STONE AGE.

70
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,196
YOU LOOK GREAT.

71
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,197
I, UH...

72
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,199
I HATE THAT.

73
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,801
SORRY. THANKS.

74
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,403
YOU LOOK GOOD TOO.

75
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:27,307
AH, WELL, YOU KNOW, IN HERE ANYONE WHO...

76
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,309
STANDS ERECT...

77
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,112
SO, WHAT'S NEW?

78
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,314
STILL, UH...

79
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,815
A LESBIAN?

80
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,517
WELL...

81
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:38,818
YOU NEVER KNOW.

82
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,221
HOW'S, UM... HOW'S THE FAMILY?

83
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,523
MARTY'S STILL TOTALLY PARANOID.

84
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,824
OH, AND THAT'S...

85
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,025
CAROL, WHY ARE YOU

86
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,027
HERE, CAROL?

87
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,629
I'M PREGNANT.

88
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,231
PREGNANT.

89
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:02,242
Ha! It looks like she didn't leave in such a hurry after all.

90
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,845
I THINK THIS IS THE EPISODE OF THREE'S COMPANY

91
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:09,048
WHERE THERE'S SOME KIND OF MISUNDERSTANDING.

92
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,652
OH, THEN I'VE ALREADY SEEN THIS ONE.

93
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,855
ARE YOU THROUGH WITH THAT?

94
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,658
YEAH, SORRY. THE SWALLOWING SLOWED ME DOWN.

95
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,960
WHOSE LITTLE BALL OF PAPER IS THIS?

96
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,562
OH, THAT WOULD BE MINE.

97
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,564
SEE, I WROTE A NOTE TO MYSELF

98
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,065
THEN I REALIZED

99
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,268
I DIDN'T NEED IT, SO I BALLED IT UP...

100
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,270
AND NOW I WISH I WAS DEAD.

101
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,272
SHE ALREADY FLUFFED THAT PILLOW.

102
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,673
MONICA, YOU ALREADY...

103
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,675
BUT IT'S FINE.

104
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,077
LOOK, I'M SORRY, GUYS, I JUST DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM

105
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,679
ANY MORE AMMUNITION THAN THEY ALREADY HAVE.

106
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,181
YES, AND WE ALL KNOW HOW CRUEL A PARENT CAN BE

107
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,183
ABOUT THE FLATNESS OF A CHILD'S PILLOW.

108
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,285
WOULD YOU RELAX?

109
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,687
YOU DO THIS EVERY TIME THEY COME.

110
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,289
THE PLACE LOOKS GREAT.

111
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,591
YOU GOT A BEAUTIFUL LASAGNA HERE

112
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,593
THAT LOOKS GOOD ENOUGH TO...

113
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:54,794
AVOID TOUCHING.

114
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,499
MONICA? HI.

115
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,801
UM, MONICA?

116
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,903
YOU'RE SCARING ME.

117
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:08,508
I MEAN, YOU'RE LIKE ALL CHAOTIC AND TWIRLY, YOU KNOW?

118
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,109
AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY.

119
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,711
YEAH, CALM DOWN.

120
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,514
YOU DON'T SEE ROSS GETTING ALL

121
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,115
CHAOTIC AND TWIRLY

122
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,117
EVERY TIME THEY COME.

123
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:21,321
THAT'S BECAUSE AS FAR AS MY PARENTS ARE CONCERNED

124
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,522
ROSS CAN DO NO WRONG.

125
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,524
YOU SEE, HE'S THE PRINCE.

126
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:28,528
APPARENTLY, THEY HAD SOME BIG CEREMONY BEFORE I WAS BORN.

127
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,129
EW, EW, EW, EW, EW!

128
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,731
WHAT?

129
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,733
UGLY NAKED GUY GOT A THIGH MASTER.

130
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,837
 EW...

131
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,340
HAS ANYBODY SEEN MY ENGAGEMENT RING?

132
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,941
YEAH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

133
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,748
OH, GOD. OH, GOD.

134
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,250
OH, GOD. OH, GOD. OH, GOD.

135
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,552
NO, DON'T TOUCH THAT.

136
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:57,357
OH, LIKE I WASN'T DREADING TOMORROW ENOUGH--

137
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,758
HAVING TO GIVE IT BACK TO HIM.

138
00:05:58,758 --> 00:05:59,959
"HI, BARRY. REMEMBER ME?

139
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,561
"I'M THE GIRL IN THE VEIL

140
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,764
THAT STOMPED ON YOUR HEART IN FRONT OF YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY."

141
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,967
OH, GOD, NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE TO RETURN THE RING

142
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,170
WITHOUT THE RING, WHICH MAKES IT SO MUCH HARDER.

143
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,172
EASY, RACH. WE'LL FIND IT.

144
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:13,973
WON'T WE?

145
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,575
OH. YEAH.

146
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,676
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

147
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:17,877
YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE IT BACK TO HIM

148
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,279
IT'LL ALL BE OVER, AND WE'LL EAT A LOT OF ICE CREAM.

149
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,382
OKAY, IT'S A LITTLE PEAR SHAPED DIAMOND...

150
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,184
I TELL YOU WHAT-- ANY DIAMOND RING WE FIND

151
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,686
WE'LL RUN IT BY YOU.

152
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,489
ALL RIGHT, WHEN DID YOU HAVE IT ON LAST?

153
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,191
DOY. PROBABLY RIGHT BEFORE SHE LOST IT.

154
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,596
YOU DON'T GET A LOT OF "DOY" THESE DAYS.

155
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,200
NO, I HAD IT THIS MORNING

156
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,804
AND I KNOW I HAD IT WHEN I WAS IN THE KITCHEN WITH...

157
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,806
DINAH?

158
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,011
OH, DON'T BE MAD.

159
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,212
YOU DIDN'T.

160
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,814
OH, I'M SORRY.

161
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,216
I GAVE YOU ONE JOB.

162
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,420
OH, BUT LOOK HOW STRAIGHT THOSE NOODLES ARE.

163
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,422
 MONICA, YOU KNOW

164
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,625
THAT'S NOT HOW YOU LOOK FOR AN ENGAGEMENT RING

165
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,226
IN A LASAGNA.

166
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:10,430
I JUST CAN'T DO IT.

167
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,232
BOYS?

168
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,635
WE'RE GOING IN.

169
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,840

170
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,045
HI.

171
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,448
OH, THAT IS NOT A HAPPY "HI."

172
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,049
CAROL'S PREGNANT.

173
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,351
OOH, I FOUND IT!

174
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,354
WELL, WHAT..?

175
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,356
WHA WHA..? WHAT..?

176
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:38,257
YEAH.

177
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,461
DO THAT FOR ANOTHER TWO HOURS

178
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,064
YOU MIGHT BE WHERE I AM RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

179
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,166
KIND OF PUTS THAT WHOLE PILLOW THING

180
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,768
IN PERSPECTIVE, HUH, MON?

181
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,573
HOW DO YOU FIT INTO THIS WHOLE THING?

182
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,575
WELL, CAROL SAYS SHE AND SUSAN

183
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,176
WANT ME TO BE INVOLVED

184
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,178
BUT IF I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH IT

185
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,180
I DON'T HAVE TO BE INVOLVED.

186
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,583
BASICALLY, IT'S TOTALLY UP TO ME.

187
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,784
SHE IS SO GREAT.

188
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:05,985
I MISS HER.

189
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,692
WELL, WHAT DOES SHE MEAN BY "INVOLVED"?

190
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,293
PRESUMABLY, THE BIGGEST PART

191
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:17,096
OF YOUR JOB IS DONE.

192
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,098
AND THE MOST ENJOYABLE.

193
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,301
PHOEBE, SAY SOMETHING.

194
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,503
ANYWAY

195
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,506
THEY WANT ME TO GO DOWN TO THIS SONOGRAM THING

196
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,107
WITH THEM TOMORROW.

197
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:28,908
WOW.

198
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,711
YEAH. REMEMBER BACK WHEN LIFE WAS SIMPLER

199
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,713
AND SHE WAS JUST A LESBIAN?

200
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,715
AH, THOSE WERE THE DAYS.

201
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,918
WELL, SO, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

202
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,119
I HAVE NO IDEA.

203
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,121
NO MATTER WHAT I DO, THOUGH

204
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,524
I'M STILL GOING TO BE A FATHER.

205
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:48,127

206
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,836
THIS IS STILL RUINED, RIGHT?

207
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:06,846
OH, MARTHA LUDWIN'S DAUGHTER IS GOING TO CALL YOU.

208
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:11,250
HMM, WHAT'S THAT CURRY TASTE?

209
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,952
CURRY.

210
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,855
MMM.

211
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,257
I THINK THEY'RE GREAT.

212
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,458
I REALLY DO.

213
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,060
YOU REMEMBER THE LUDWINS.

214
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,462
THE BIG ONE HAD A THING FOR YOU, DIDN'T SHE?

215
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,364
THEY ALL HAD A THING FOR HIM.

216
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:26,566
OH, MOM.

217
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,167
 I'M SORRY. WHY IS

218
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,869
THIS GIRL GOING TO CALL ME?

219
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,772
SHE JUST GRADUATED, AND SHE WANTS TO BE SOMETHING

220
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,174
IN COOKING OR FOOD OR... I DON'T KNOW.

221
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,176
I TOLD HER YOU HAVE A RESTAURANT...

222
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:38,377
NO, MOM. I DON'T

223
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,579
HAVE A RESTAURANT.

224
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,180
I WORKIN A RESTAURANT.

225
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,082
WELL, THEY DON'T HAVE

226
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,184
TO KNOW THAT.

227
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,786
 ROSS, COULD YOU

228
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,589
COME AND HELP ME WITH THE SPAGHETTI, PLEASE?

229
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,790
YES.

230
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,692
OH, WE'RE HAVING SPAGHETTI.

231
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,694
THAT'S... EASY.

232
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:57,797
ACTUALLY, WE WERE GOING TO HAVE LASAGNA.

233
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,398
OH, I LOVE LASAGNA.

234
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,800
WELL, WE'RE NOT HAVING IT.

235
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,902
THEN WHY DID YOU BRING IT UP?

236
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,904
YOU KNOW HOW HE LATCHES ON.

237
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:10,109
I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO SOUND UNBELIEVABLY SELFISH ON MY PART

238
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,711
BUT WERE YOU PLANNING ON BRINGING UP

239
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,312
THE WHOLE BABY- LESBIAN THING?

240
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,715
BECAUSE I THINK IT MIGHT TAKE

241
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,216
SOME OF THE HEAT OFF ME.

242
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,820
WHAT THAT RACHEL DID TO HER LIFE.

243
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,222
WE RAN INTO HER PARENTS AT THE CLUB.

244
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,824
THEY WERE NOT PLAYING VERY WELL.

245
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,425
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU

246
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,427
WHAT THEY SPENT ON THAT WEDDING

247
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,830
BUT 40,000 DOLLARS IS A LOT OF MONEY.

248
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,535
WELL, AT LEAST SHE HAD THE CHANCE

249
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:40,539
TO LEAVE A MAN AT THE ALTAR.

250
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,141
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

251
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,743
NOTHING.

252
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,344
IT'S AN EXPRESSION.

253
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,946
NO, IT'S NOT.

254
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,547
DON'T LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER.

255
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,549
YOU'RE INDEPENDENT, AND YOU ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

256
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,151
EVEN WHEN YOU WERE A KID

257
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,453
AND YOU WERE CHUBBY, AND YOU HAD NO FRIENDS

258
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,657
YOU WERE JUST FINE.

259
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,260
AND YOU WOULD READ ALONE IN YOUR ROOM-- AND YOUR PUZZLES.

260
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,465
LOOK, THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE ROSS

261
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,768
WHO NEED TO SHOOT FOR THE STARS

262
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,871
WITH HIS MUSEUM AND HIS PAPERS GETTING PUBLISHED.

263
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,074
OTHER PEOPLE ARE SATISFIED WITH STAYING WHERE THEY ARE.

264
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,076
I'M TELLING YOU, THESE ARE THE PEOPLE

265
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,278
WHO NEVER GET CANCER.

266
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,781
THEY'RE HAPPY WITH WHAT THEY HAVE.

267
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,583
THEY'RE BASICALLY CONTENT, LIKE... COWS.

268
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,687
COWS, DAD?

269
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,089
SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH I LOVE COWS.

270
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,994
AND I READ ABOUT THESE WOMEN

271
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,195
TRYING TO HAVE IT ALL

272
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,597
AND I THANK GOD OUR LITTLE HARMONICA

273
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,000
DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE THAT PROBLEM.

274
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,002
I'M TELLING YOU, SWEETHEART

275
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,004
YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.

276
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,406
THANK YOU, DADDY.

277
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,408

278
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,811
OH, SO THIS DOES WORK.

279
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:57,116
SO, ROSS, WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

280
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,517
ANY STORIES?

281
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,519
NO NEWS, NO LITTLE ANECDOTES

282
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,121
TO SHARE WITH THE FOLKS?

283
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,322
OKAY, OKAY.

284
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:09,128
LOOK, I REALIZE YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN WONDERING

285
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,730
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED

286
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,933
BETWEEN CAROL AND ME, AND SO, WELL...

287
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:14,834
HERE'S THE DEAL.

288
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,538
CAROL'S A LESBIAN.

289
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,843
SHE IS LIVING WITH A WOMAN NAMED SUSAN.

290
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,347
SHE'S PREGNANT WITH MY CHILD

291
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,752
AND SHE AND SUSAN ARE GOING TO RAISE THE BABY.

292
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,357
AND YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS?

293
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,167
FOLKS ARE REALLY THAT BAD, HUH?

294
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,771
WELL, YOU KNOW, THESE PEOPLE ARE PROS.

295
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,173
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

296
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,175
THEY TAKE THEIR TIME.

297
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:59,779
THEY GET THE JOB DONE.

298
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,084
I KNOW THEY SAY THAT YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR PARENTS.

299
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,285
BOY, IF YOU COULD

300
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,887
I'D WANT YOURS.

301
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:10,689
MUST PEE.

302
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,193
IT'S EVEN WORSE WHEN YOU'RE TWINS.

303
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,394
YOU'RE A TWIN?

304
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,595
YEAH. WE DON'T SPEAK.

305
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,799
SHE'S LIKE THIS HIGH POWERED, DRIVEN, CAREER TYPE.

306
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,800
WHAT DOES SHE DO?

307
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,001
SHE'S A WAITRESS.

308
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,804
IDENTICAL?

309
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:28,407
YEAH, PEOPLE SAY WE LOOK ALIKE, BUT I DON'T SEE IT.

310
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,810
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

311
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,411
I'VE KIND OF GOT TO CLEAN UP NOW.

312
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,313
CHANDLER, YOU'RE AN ONLY CHILD, RIGHT?

313
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,514
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OF THIS.

314
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,717
WELL, NO, ALTHOUGH I DID HAVE AN IMAGINARY FRIEND

315
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,120
WHO MY PARENTS ACTUALLY PREFERRED.

316
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,925
 HIT THE LIGHTS, PLEASE.

317
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,632
HOW LONG WAS I IN THERE?

318
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,634
I'M JUST CLEANING UP.

319
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:59,438
OH, YOU, UH, DO YOU NEED ANY HELP?

320
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,440
UM, OKAY, SURE.

321
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,241
THANKS.

322
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,850
ANYWAY, UH, SO YOU

323
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,053
NERVOUS ABOUT BARRY TOMORROW?

324
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,254
UH, A LITTLE.

325
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:16,455
MM HMM.

326
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:18,457
A LOT.

327
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,459
MM HMM.

328
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,361
SO, GOT ANY ADVICE--

329
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:26,765
YOU KNOW, AS SOMEONE WHO'S RECENTLY BEEN DUMPED?

330
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,268
WELL, YOU MAY WANT TO STEER CLEAR

331
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,270
OF THE WORD "DUMPED."

332
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,073
CHANCES ARE, HE'S GOING TO BE THIS

333
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:37,276
THIS BROKEN SHELL OF A MAN.

334
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,678
SO YOU SHOULD TRY NOT TO LOOK TOO TERRIFIC.

335
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,280
I KNOW IT'LL BE HARD.

336
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:47,086
UH, OR, YOU KNOW, I CAN, UH... HEY, I'LL GO DOWN THERE

337
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,889
AND GIVE BARRY BACK HIS RING

338
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,291
YOU CAN GO WITH CAROL AND SUSAN TO

339
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,494
THE OB GYN.

340
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,897
YOU'VE GOT CAROL TOMORROW.

341
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,100
UGH, WHEN DID IT GET SO COMPLICATED?

342
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,701
GOT ME.

343
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,603
REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER?

344
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,205
YEAH.

345
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,506
I MEAN, DIDN'T YOU THINK

346
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,909
YOU WERE JUST GOING TO MEET SOMEONE, FALL IN LOVE

347
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,110
AND THAT WOULD BE IT?

348
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,714

349
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:16,916
ROSS?

350
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,117
YES, YES.

351
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,320
UGH.

352
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,722
MAN, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE HERE.

353
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,224
HMM.

354
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,532
ME NEITHER.

355
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,250
HI. OH, SORRY I'M LATE.

356
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,252
I GOT STUCK AT WORK.

357
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,254
THERE WAS THIS BIG DINOSAUR THING.

358
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,455
ANYWAY.

359
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,357
HI.

360
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,960
ROSS, YOU REMEMBER SUSAN.

361
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,962
HOW COULD I FORGET?

362
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,163
ROSS.

363
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,764
HELLO, SUSAN.

364
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,167
GOOD SHAKE. GOOD SHAKE.

365
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:11,870
SO, UH, WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR...

366
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,671
DR. OBERMAN.

367
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,273
DR. OBERMAN. AND IS HE..?

368
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,074
SHE.

369
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,476
"SHE," OF COURSE.

370
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,478
SHE, UH, FAMILIAR

371
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,281
WITH OUR SPECIAL SITUATION?

372
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,383
YES, AND SHE'S VERY SUPPORTIVE.

373
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,485
GREAT. OKAY, THAT'S GREAT.

374
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,489

00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,505

00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,507
QUACK, QUACK. QUACK, QUACK.

378
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,109
QUACK, QUACK, QUACK.

380
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,712
THAT OPENS MY CERVIX.

381
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,120
BARRY?

382
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,422
COME ON IN.

383
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,223
ARE YOU SURE?

384
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:05,824
IT'S FINE.

385
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,826
BOBBY'S GOING TO BE HERE FOR HOURS.

386
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:08,627
HUH?

387
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,231
SO...

388
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,432

391
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,739
YOU LOOK GREAT.

392
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:21,940
YEAH, WELL...

393
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,542
 Dr. Farber

394
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,544
Jason Greenspan is gagging.

395
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,745
BE RIGHT THERE.

396
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,347
BE BACK IN A SECOND.

397
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,453
I DUMPED HIM.

398
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,856
OKAY.

399
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,072
SO, UH...

400
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,074
SO HOW'S THIS, UH...

401
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,775
HOW'S THIS ALL GOING TO WORK?

402
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,078
WELL, THE BABY GROWS IN A SPECIAL PLACE INSIDE MOMMY'S...

403
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,080
THANK YOU.

404
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,083
I MEAN, HOW'S THIS GOING TO WORK

405
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,684
YOU KNOW, WITH US?

406
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:06,485
YOU KNOW WHEN, LIKE

407
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,887
IMPORTANT DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE?

408
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,689
GIVE ME A "FOR INSTANCE."

409
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:11,890
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

410
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,892
HOW ABOUT WITH THE BABY'S NAME?

411
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,094
MARLON.

412
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:15,994
MARLON.

413
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,596
OR "MINNIE" IF IT'S A GIRL.

414
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,801
AS IN "MOUSE"?

415
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,404
AS IN MY GRANDMOTHER.

416
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:29,408
STILL, YOU SAY "MINNIE," YOU HEAR "MOUSE."

417
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,412
UM, HOW ABOUT, UM...

418
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,414
HOW ABOUT "JULIA"?

419
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,015
JULIA.

420
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,717
WE AGREED ON MINNIE.

421
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:39,918
THAT'S FUNNY, UM, WE AGREED

422
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,321
WE'D SPEND THE REST OUR LIVES TOGETHER.

423
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,522
THINGS CHANGE--

424
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,923
ROLL WITH THE PUNCHES.

425
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,725
I BELIEVE JULIA'S ON THE TABLE.

426
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:49,828
OH.

427
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,430
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

428
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,035
SO, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?

429
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,139
OH, NOT MUCH.

430
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,340
I GOT A JOB.

431
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,342
THAT'S GREAT.

432
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,344
WHY ARE YOU SO TAN?

433
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:09,148
OH, I, UH, I WENT TO ARUBA.

434
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,150
OH, NO.

435
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,552
YOU WENT ON OUR HONEYMOON ALONE?

436
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,154
NO.

437
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,357
NO, ACTUALLY, UH...

438
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,958
I WENT WITH, UH...

439
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,761
NOW THIS MAY HURT.

440
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:23,562
ME?

441
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,164
NO, NO.

442
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,767
I WENT WITH MINDY.

443
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,169
MINDY?

444
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,971
MY MAID OF HONOR, MINDY?

445
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,973
YEAH, WE'RE, UH...

446
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,175
KIND OF A THING NOW.

447
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,776
OH.

448
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,579
WELL, UM, I...

449
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,581
YOU GOT PLUGS.

450
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,784
CAREFUL THEY HAVEN'T QUITE TAKEN YET.

451
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:46,985
AND YOU GOT LENSES.

452
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:50,589
BUT YOU HATE STICKING YOUR FINGER IN YOUR EYE.

453
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,991
NOT FOR HER.

454
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,794
OH.

455
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,798
LISTEN, I REALLY WANTED TO THANK YOU.

456
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,200
OKAY.

457
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,803
SEE, ABOUT A MONTH AGO, I WANTED TO HURT YOU--

458
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:07,606
MORE THAN I'VE EVER WANTED TO HURT ANYONE IN MY LIFE.

459
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,208
AND I'M AN ORTHODONTIST.

460
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,210
WOW.

461
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,312
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE RIGHT.

462
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,913
I THOUGHT WE WERE HAPPY.

463
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,515
WE WEREN'T HAPPY.

464
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,519
BUT WITH MINDY...

465
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,521
NOW I'M HAPPY.

466
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,423
SPIT.

467
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:24,823
WHAT?

468
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,124
ME.

469
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,229
ANYWAY, UM...

470
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,432
I GUESS, UH...

471
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,033
I GUESS THIS BELONGS TOYOU.

472
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,035
OR, HEY, MAYBE SOMEDAY MINDY.

473
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,237
YEAH, LIKE SHE'D SETTLE FOR THAT.

474
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,041
OH... YEAH.

475
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,643
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

476
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,245
UH... BUT, UH...

477
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,448
I THINK IT'S, UH, I THINK IT'S A NICE RING

478
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:53,051
AND, UM, AND THANK YOU FOR GIVING IT TO ME.

479
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:55,854
WELL, THANK YOU FOR GIVING IT BACK.

480
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,759
HELLO?

481
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,565
OH, PLEASE. WHAT'S WRONG WITH HELEN?

482
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:07,766
"HELEN GELLER"?

483
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,969
I DON'T THINK SO.

484
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,571
HELLO? IT'S NOT GOING TO BE HELEN GELLER.

485
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:13,372
THANK YOU.

486
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,973
NO, I MEAN

487
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,174
IT'S NOT GELLER.

488
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,577
IT'S GOING TO BE "HELEN WILLICK?"

489
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,979
NO, ACTUALLY WE TALKED ABOUT

490
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:22,981
"HELEN WILLICK BUNCH."

491
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,984
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.

492
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,387
WHY IS SHE IN THE TITLE?

493
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,988
BECAUSE IT'S MY BABY, TOO.

494
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:33,191
REALLY? I DON'T REMEMBER YOU MAKING ANY SPERM.

495
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:38,397
YEAH, AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT A CHALLENGE THAT IS.

496
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,598
SEE, SEE?

497
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,199
ALL RIGHT, YOU TWO STOP IT.

498
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,201
NO, SHE GETS A CREDIT, I'M IN THERE TOO.

499
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,504
ROSS, YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY SUGGESTING

500
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,105
"HELEN WILLICK BUNCH GELLER?"

501
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,107
BECAUSE I THINK THAT BORDERS ON CHILD ABUSE.

502
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,309
UH, OF COURSE NOT.

503
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,111
I'M SUGGESTING "GELLER WILLICK BUNCH."

504
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,713
OH, NO. NO, NO, NO. SEE WHAT HE'S DOING?

505
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,715
HE KNOWS NO ONE'S GOING TO SAY ALL THOSE NAMES.

506
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,717
HE KNOWS THEY'LL WIND UP CALLING HER "GELLER."

507
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,319
THEN HE GETS HIS WAY.

508
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,120
MY WAY? YOU THINK THIS IS MY WAY?

509
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:05,324
BELIEVE ME, OF ALL THE WAYS I EVER IMAGINED

510
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,527
THIS MOMENT IN MY LIFE BEING-- THIS IS NOT MY WAY.

511
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:09,528
YOU KNOW WHAT?

512
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,530
THIS IS TOO HARD-- I CAN'T...

513
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,531
HOW ARE WE?

514
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:13,332
ANY NAUSEA?

515
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:14,533
A LITTLE.

516
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,336
YEAH. JUST A LITTLE.

517
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,838
I WAS JUST WONDERING ABOUT THE MOTHER TO BE

518
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,440
BUT THANKS FOR SHARING.

519
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,442
UH, LIE BACK.

520
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:24,743
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

521
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,345
I'M GOING TO GO.

522
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:30,749
I DON'T THINK I CAN BE INVOLVED IN THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY.

523
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:31,950

524
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,753

525
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,661
OH, MY GOD.

526
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,262
LOOK AT THAT.

527
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,864
I KNOW.

528
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:46,765

529
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,173

530
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:58,777
WELL, ISN'T THAT AMAZING?

531
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,782
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE SEEING HERE?

532
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,587
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT

533
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,689
TO ATTACK THE ENTERPRISE.

534
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,292
YOU KNOW, IF YOU TILT YOUR HEAD TO THE LEFT

535
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,894
AND RELAX YOUR EYES

536
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,896
IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE AN OLD POTATO.

537
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,699
THEN DON'T DO THAT, ALL RIGHT?

538
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,300
OKAY.

539
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:24,703
MONICA.

540
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,506
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

541
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,908
MM HMM.

542
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,510
ARE YOU WELLING UP?

543
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,711
NO.

544
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:33,912
YOU ARE.

545
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:34,713
YOU'RE WELLING UP.

546
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:35,914
NO, I'M NOT.

547
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,115
YOU'LL BE AN AUNT.

548
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,717
SHUT UP.

549
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,119
HI, MINDY.

550
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,522
HI, I IT'S RACHEL.

551
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,123
YEAH, I'M FINE.

552
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,526
I I SAW BARRY TODAY.

553
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,728
UH, YEAH, HE TOLD ME.

554
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,329
NO. NO, IT'S OKAY.

555
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,931
REALLY, IT'S OKAY.

556
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:56,435
I HOPE YOU TWO ARE VERY HAPPY, I REALLY DO.

557
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,437
UH, OH, AND MIN, YOU KNOW

558
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,338
IF EVERYTHING WORKS OUT AND YOU GUYS

559
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:01,940
END UP GETTING MARRIED

560
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,942
AND HAVING KIDS AND EVERYTHING...

561
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,546
I JUST HOPE THEY HAVE HIS OLD HAIRLINE AND YOUR OLD NOSE.

562
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,852
OKAY, I KNOW IT WAS A CHEAP SHOT

563
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:16,254
BUT I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER NOW.
