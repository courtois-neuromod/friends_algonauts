1
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:05,205
IS JUST ONCE COULD WE GO TO LUNCH AND NOT TALK

2
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:07,407
ABOUT WHAT I'M WEARING OR HOW I'M DOING MY HAIR

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:08,608
OR WHERE MY CAREER IS GOING?

4
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:09,809
OR WHO I'M DATING.

5
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:11,611
OH...

6
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,513
WELL, ARE WE READY FOR THE CHECK? YES!

7
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,714
GOD, YES! NO, I'LL TAKE IT.

8
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,016
OH, NO, DARLING, DON'T BE SILLY.

9
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:16,916
I SAID I'LL TAKE IT.

10
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,118
HERE, TAKE IT.

11
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,320
GO. RUN!

12
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,323
THAT'S VERY SWEET.

13
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:24,924
AND ON WHAT THEY PAY YOU...

14
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:25,925
CAREER...

15
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,130
MOM, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ME, OKAY?

16
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,331
I'M DOING FINE.

17
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,433
I'M AFRAID THIS HAS BEEN DENIED.

18
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,335
WELL, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

19
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,337
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, DEAR.

20
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,339
HERE YOU GO!   34 00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,392 HOW COULD SOMEONE GET AHOLD OF YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER?

35
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,794
I HAVE NO IDEA, BUT LOOK HOW MUCH THEY SPENT.

36
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:35,795
MONICA, WOULD YOU CALM DOWN?

37
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:36,596
THE CREDIT CARD PEOPLE SAID

38
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,598
YOU ONLY HAVE TO PAY FOR THE STUFF THAT YOU BOUGHT.

39
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,701
STILL... IT'S JUST SUCH RECKLESS SPENDING.

40
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,304
I THINK WHEN SOMEBODY STEALS YOUR CREDIT CARD

41
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,706
THEY'VE KIND OF ALREADY THROWN CAUTION TO THE WIND.

42
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,210
WOW, WHAT A GEEK.

43
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,413
THEY SPENT 69.95 ON A WONDER MOP.

44
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:57,016
THAT'S ME.

45
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:02,622
YOU SEE, WHEN I SAY "GEEK," I MEAN...

46
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,224
OH, THE HELL WITH IT.

47
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:07,427
YOU BOUGHT A $70 DOLLARS MOP-- YOU'RE A GEEK.

48
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,429
OH, YUCK.

49
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,030
ROSS, HE'S DOING IT AGAIN.

50
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,134
MARCEL, STOP HUMPING THE LAMP.

51
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,335
STOP HUMPING.

52
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,138
NOW, MARCEL, COME BACK... COME HERE, MARCEL.

53
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,339
NO, NO. NOT IN MY ROOM.

54
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,940
I'LL GET HIM.

55
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,942
ROSS, YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING

56
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,444
ABOUT THE HUMPING.

57
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,045
WHAT? IT'S IT'S JUST A PHASE.

58
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:29,549
WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE SAID ABOUT JOEY.

59
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,851
YOU THINK YOU GUYS WOULD BE

60
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,853
JUST A LITTLE MORE UNDERSTANDING, YOU KNOW?

61
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,855
I KNOW, BUT WE'RE NOT.

62
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,857
HEY, WOULD YOU ALL RELAX?

63
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,459
IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

64
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,060
 MARCEL, STOP IT!

65
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,262
MARCEL... BAD MONKEY!

66
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,463
WHAT?

67
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:47,567
LET'S JUST SAY MY CURIOUS GEORGE DOLL IS NO LONGER CURIOUS.

68
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,878
OH, MONICA, YOU ARE NOT STILL GOING OVER THAT THING?

69
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,480
THIS WOMAN'S LIVING MY LIFE.

70
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,681
WHAT?

71
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,283
SHE'S LIVING MY LIFE

72
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,685
AND SHE'S DOING IT BETTER THAN ME.

73
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,287
LOOK AT THIS.

74
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:10,890
LOOK. SHE BUYS TICKETS TO PLAYS THAT I WANT TO SEE.

75
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,492
SHE BUYS CLOTHES AT STORES

76
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,695
THAT I'M INTIMIDATED BY THE SALES PEOPLE.

77
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,697
SHE SPENT $300 ON ART SUPPLIES.

78
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,699
YOU'RE NOT AN ARTIST.

79
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,502
YEAH, WELL, I MIGHT BE IF I HAD THE SUPPLIES.

80
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,705
I MEAN, I COULD DO ALL THIS STUFF

81
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,906
ONLY I DON'T.

82
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,908
MONICA, COME ON.

83
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,510
YOU DO COOL THINGS.

84
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,711
OH, REALLY? OKAY.

85
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,313
LET'S COMPARE, SHALL WE?

86
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,715
OH, IT'S SO LATE FOR "SHALL WE."

87
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,319
DO I GO HORSEBACK RIDING IN THE PARK? HMM?

88
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,421
DO I TAKE CLASSES AT THE NEW SCHOOL?

89
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,623
NO.

90
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,024
THIS IS SO UNFAIR.

91
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,028
SHE'S GOT EVERYTHING I WANT AND SHE DOESN'T HAVE MY MOTHER.

92
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,738
HOW ABOUT "JOEY PEPPONI"?

93
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,340
NO. STILL TOO ETHNIC.

94
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,541
MY AGENT THINKS

95
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,244
I SHOULD HAVE A NAME THAT'S MORE NEUTRAL.

96
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,246
"JOEY.... SWITZERLAND?"

97
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,652
PLUS, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT SHOULD BE "JOE."

98
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,654
"JOEY" MAKES ME SOUND LIKE I'M...

99
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,656
I DON'T KNOW-- THIS BIG.

100
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,258
WHICH I'M NOT.

101
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,563
JOE, JOE, JOE... STALIN?

102
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:28,268
"STALIN... STALIN."

103
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,869
DO I KNOW THAT NAME?

104
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:30,670
THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

105
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,072
WELL, IT DOES NOT RING A BELL WITH ME.

106
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,377
BUT YOU'RE MORE PLUGGED INTO THAT WHOLE SHOW BUSINESS THING.

107
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,580
JOE STALIN.

108
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,485
YOU KNOW THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

109
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,887
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY "JOSEPH."

110
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,088
OH!

111
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,495
JOSEPH STALIN.

112
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,096
I THINK YOU'D

113
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,698
REMEMBER THAT.

114
00:04:58,698 --> 00:04:59,899
OH, YES.

115
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,704
"BYE BYE BIRDIE, STARRING JOSEPH STALIN."

116
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:08,708
"JOSEPH STALINIS THE FIDDLER ON THE ROOF."

117
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,016
HEY.

118
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,017
HEY.

119
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,218
HI.

120
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,023
HI, UH, YES. THIS IS MONICA GELLER.

121
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,826
UM, I BELIEVE I'M TAKING SOME CLASSES WITH YOU

122
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,328
AND I WAS WONDERING

123
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,829
WHAT THEY WERE.

124
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,831
WELL, I'VE HAD A RECENT HEAD INJURY

125
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,634
AND CERTAIN NUMBERS AND DATES ARE... BARBECUE?!

126
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:37,437
OH, DID I?

127
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,239
SEE? THERE YOU GO.

128
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,241
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

129
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,343
ALL RIGHT. GREAT.

130
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,345
GREAT. THANKS A LOT.

131
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,147
I'M GOING TO TAP CLASS.

132
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:49,849
SO THAT YOU CAN DANCE WITH THE WOMAN

133
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,451
THAT STOLE YOUR CREDIT CARD.

134
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,252
I WANT TO SEE WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE.

135
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,754
WELL, THEN JUST GO TO THE POST OFFICE.

136
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,356
I'M SURE THEY'VE GOT HER PICTURE UP.

137
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,256
THIS WOMAN'S GOT MY LIFE.

138
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,858
I SHOULD GET TO SEE WHO SHE IS.

139
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,360
OKAY, MONICA, YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?

140
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,561
YOU'RE KINDA LOSING IT HERE.

141
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:02,762
I MEAN, THIS IS REALLY BECOMING

142
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:03,963
LIKE, A WEIRD OBSESSION THING.

143
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,766
THIS IS MADNESS. IT'S MADNESS, I TELL YOU!

144
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,368
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, MONICA

145
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,670
DON'T DO IT!

146
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,172
THANK YOU.

147
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,382
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

148
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,983
LOTS OF THINGS.

149
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:27,987
WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK SHE IS?

150
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,188
MAY I HELP YOU?

151
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,591
NO, THANKS. WE'RE JUST HERE TO OBSERVE.

152
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,993
YOU DON'T OBSERVE A DANCE CLASS.

153
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,595
YOU DANCE A DANCE CLASS.

154
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,497
SPARE SHOES ARE OVER THERE.

155
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,101
WHAT DOES SHE MEAN?

156
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:45,705
I THINK SHE MEANS YOU DANCE... A DANCE CLASS.

157
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,707
COME ON. COME ON.

158
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,512
OKAY. YOU SEE ANYBODY YOU THINK COULD BE ME?

159
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,715
PEOPLE, LAST TIME, THERE WERE SOME EMPTY YOGURT CONTAINERS

160
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,316
LYING AROUND AFTER CLASS.

161
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,318
LET'S NOT HAVE THAT HAPPEN AGAIN.

162
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,121
SHE COULD BE YOU.

163
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,127
LET'S GET STARTED.

164
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,729
FIVE, SIX...

165
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,731
A FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT--

166
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,938
OKAY. I'M NOT GETTING THIS.

167
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,741
I'M TOTALLY GETTING IT.

168
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:28,147
DO YOU EVER JUST FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES YOU ARE

169
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,149
SO UNBELIEVABLY UNCOORDINATED?

170
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,757
WHAT?

171
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,159
YOU JUST CLICK WHEN THEY CLICK.

172
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,761
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE.

173
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,564
NOW EVERYONE GRAB A PARTNER.

174
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,866
OH... UM, ALL RIGHT.

175
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,069
AND MY DEAD MOTHER SAID YOU ARE IT.

176
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,270
I'M WITH RACHEL.

177
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,474
WAIT. IT'S GYM CLASS ALL OVER AGAIN.

178
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,776
OH... OH...

179
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,278
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT, YOU CAN COME UP TO THE FRONT

180
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,480
AND DANCE WITH ME.

181
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,683
WHY DON'T I JUST TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES

182
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,284
AND HAVE A NIGHTMARE?

183
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,190
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

184
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,792
I'M HERE. I'M HERE.

185
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,794
I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE.

186
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,395
OKAY, HERE I AM.

187
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,798
SO, WHO'S THE NEW TENSE GIRL?

188
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,800
SHE'S YOUR PARTNER.

189
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,401
HI. I'M MONICA.

190
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,405
OH... MONICA.

191
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,010
HI. I'M MON... NANA.

192
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,911
MONANA?

193
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,212
YES.

194
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,814
IT'S DUTCH.

195
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,015
YOU'RE KIDDING?

196
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,417
I SPENT THREE YEARS IN AMSTERDAM.

197
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,019
MAG IK DEZE DANS VAN U?

198
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,823
UM, PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH.

199
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,825
OH.

200
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,026
AND WE'RE DANCING.

201
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,028
A FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT--

202
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,838
HI.

203
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,440
HEY. HEY.

204
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,442
WHERE'VE YOU BEEN?

205
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,845
I JUST GOT BACK FROM THE VET.

206
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,247
SHE'S NOT GOING TO MAKE YOU WEAR

207
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,450
ONE OF THOSE BIG PLASTIC CONES, IS SHE?

208
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,054
SHE SAYS MARCEL'S HUMPING THING'S NOT A PHASE.

209
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:19,058
APPARENTLY, HE'S REACHED SEXUAL MATURITY.

210
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,861
HEY, HE BEAT YOU.

211
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,265
SHE SAYS AS TIME GOES ON

212
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:30,670
HE'S GOING TO START GETTING AGGRESSIVE AND VIOLENT.

213
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,271
SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

214
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:36,275
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE HIM UP.

215
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,391
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT, ROSS.

216
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,593
THIS SUCKS!

217
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,695
I MEAN, I DON'T GET IT. YOU JUST GOT HIM.

218
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,296
HOW COULD HE BE AN ADULT ALREADY?

219
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:58,898
I KNOW, I KNOW.

220
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,300
I MEAN, ONE DAY HE'S THIS LITTLE THING

221
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,302
AND THEN BEFORE YOU KNOW IT

222
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,505
HE'S THIS LITTLE THING I CAN'T GET OFF MY LEG.

223
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,709
ISN'T THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN KEEP HIM?

224
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,312
NO. NO, THE VET SAID THAT UNLESS HE'S IN A PLACE

225
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:16,515
WHERE HE HAS REGULAR ACCESS TO SOME...

226
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,117
MONKEY LOVING...

227
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,519
HE'S JUST GOING TO GET VICIOUS.

228
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,324
I'VE... I'VE JUST GOT TO GET HIM INTO A ZOO.

229
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,828
HOW DO YOU GET A MONKEY INTO A ZOO?

230
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,029
I KNOW THAT ONE.

231
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:38,638
NO, THAT'S "POPES INTO A VOLKSWAGEN."

232
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,640
WELL, WE'RE APPLYING TO A LOT OF THEM

233
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,642
AND NATURALLY, OUR FIRST CHOICE

234
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,644
WOULD BE ONE OF THE BIGGER STATE ZOOS--

235
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,245
YOU KNOW, LIKE SAN DIEGO.

236
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,447
OH... RIGHT?

237
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,449
BUT THAT MAY BE JUST A PIPE DREAM

238
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,852
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE'S OUT OF STATE.

239
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:57,256
UH, MY VET KNOWS SOMEONE AT MIAMI

240
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,659
SO THAT'S A POSSIBILITY.

241
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,462
YEAH, BUT THAT'S, LIKE, TWO BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE BEACH.

242
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:07,967
I MEAN, IT'S A TOTAL PARTY ZOO.

243
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,170
HEY. WE FOUND HER, WE FOUND THE GIRL.

244
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,772
DID YOU CALL THE COPS?

245
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,774
NOPE. WE TOOK HER TO LUNCH.

246
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,677
AH, YOUR OWN BRAND OF VIGILANTE JUSTICE.

247
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,079
ARE YOU INSANE?

248
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,081
THIS WOMAN STOLE FROM YOU!

249
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,483
SHE... SHE STOLE! SHE'S A STEALER!

250
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:27,286
YOU KNOW WHAT? AFTER YOU'RE WITH THIS WOMAN

251
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,487
FOR, LIKE, TEN MINUTES

252
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,389
YOU FORGET ALL THAT.

253
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,392
I MEAN, SHE'S THIS ASTOUNDING PERSON

254
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,394
WITH THIS AMAZING SPIRIT.

255
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:38,798
YEAH, WHICH SHE PROBABLY STOLE FROM SOME CHEERLEADER.

256
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,201
"TAKE OFF THEIR HATS."

257
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,302
"POPES IN

258
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,804
A VOLKSWAGEN."

259
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,907
I LOVE THAT JOKE.

260
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,814
NO WAY... NO WAY DID YOU DO THIS.

261
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,616
MONANA WAS VERY BRAVE.

262
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:58,818
IT WAS SO WILD.

263
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,620
WE TOLD THEM WE WERE THE GUNDERSONS IN ROOM 615

264
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,023
ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THE BOSTON CELTICS

265
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,425
HAD TAKEN OVER THE ENTIRE SIXTH FLOOR.

266
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:07,727
WHEN THEY CAUGHT ON TO THE FACT

267
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,129
THAT WE'RE, YOU KNOW, SHORT AND HAVE BREASTS...

268
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,330
THEY THREW US OUT.

269
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,333
I WAS THROWN OUT OF A HOTEL-- ME!

270
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,335
GO, MONANA!

271
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:22,141
WELL, YOU LADIES ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES LIVING THE DREAM.

272
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,344
I GET TO GO POUR COFFEE FOR PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW.

273
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,346
DON'T WAIT UP.

274
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:32,952
OH, BY THE WAY-- TOMORROW, WE'RE AUDITIONING FOR A BROADWAY SHOW.

275
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,455
EXCUSE ME?

276
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,257
THERE'S AN OPEN CALL FOR CATS.

277
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,060
I'M THINKING WE GO DOWN THERE, SING "MEMORIES"

278
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,462
AND MAKE COMPLETE FOOLS OF OURSELVES.

279
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,663
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

280
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,265
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

281
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,468
REMEMBER WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH HERE.

282
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:50,269
I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

283
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,873
I CAN'T EVEN STAND IN FRONT OF A TAP CLASS.

284
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,875
THAT'S JUST PROBABLY BECAUSE

285
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,877
OF YOUR AMISH BACKGROUND.

286
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:58,677
WHAT?

287
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,279
WELL, YOU'RE PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH, RIGHT?

288
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,883
RIGHT... TILL I BOUGHT A BLOW DRYER

289
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,285
AND THEN I WAS SHUNNED.

290
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,488
I USED TO BE JUST LIKE YOU

291
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:13,492
AND THEN ONE DAY I SAW A MOVIE THAT CHANGED MY LIFE.

292
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,295
DID YOU EVER SEE DEAD POETS SOCIETY?

293
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:17,897
UH HUH.

294
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,500
I THOUGHT THAT MOVIE WAS SO INCREDIBLY... BORING.

295
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,701
I MEAN, THAT THING AT THE END

296
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:27,106
WHERE THE KID KILLS HIMSELF BECAUSE HE CAN'T BE IN THE PLAY?

297
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,108
WHAT WAS THAT?

298
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,911
IT'S LIKE, "KID, WAIT A YEAR, LEAVE HOME.

299
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,913
DO SOME COMMUNITY THEATER."

300
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:37,116
I WALKED OUT OF THERE AND I THOUGHT

301
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,518
"NOW, THAT'S TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE

302
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:42,321
THAT I'M NEVER GETTING BACK."

303
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:46,325
AND THAT THOUGHT SCARED ME MORE THAN ALL THE OTHER CRAP

304
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,927
I WAS AFRAID TO DO.

305
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,729
WOW. THEN I WOULD DEFINITELY

306
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,331
NOT RECOMMEND MRS. DOUBTFIRE.

307
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,537

308
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,340
OH, GOD.

309
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,944
WE DIDN'T GET INTO SCRANTON.

310
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:08,948
THAT WAS, LIKE, OUR SAFETY ZOO.

311
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:13,152
THEY TAKE, LIKE, DOGS AND COWS.

312
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,456
SEE? I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS IS HARDER ON--

313
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,859
ME OR HIM.

314
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,863
I'D SAY THAT CHAIR'S TAKING THE BRUNT OF IT.

315
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:27,666
 MARCEL! MARCEL!

316
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,168
MARCEL, NO!

317
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,271
GOOD BOY.

318
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,074
SEE? HOW CAN NOBODY WANT HIM?

319
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,675
OH, SOMEBODY WILL.

320
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:42,181
YOU KNOW THERE ALREADY IS A JOSEPH STALIN?

321
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,687
YOU'RE KIDDING.

322
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,790
APPARENTLY, HE WAS THIS RUSSIAN DICTATOR

323
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,193
WHO SLAUGHTERED ALL THESE PEOPLE.

324
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,796
YOU'D THINK YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT.

325
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,398
YOU KNOW, YOU'D THINK I WOULD'VE.

326
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,102
HEY, HOW ABOUT JOEY HEATHERTON?

327
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,006
COME ON, SERIOUSLY.

328
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,408
I TOLD YOU, I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO JOEY.

329
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,812
PHOEBE, WHAT DO YOU THINK

330
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,615
A GOOD STAGE NAME FOR ME WOULD BE?

331
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,818
FLAME BOY.

332
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,228
WHERE EXACTLY IS YOUR ZOO?

333
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,031
WELL, IT'S TECHNICALLY NOT A ZOO, PER SE.

334
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:35,234
IT'S MORE OF AN INTERACTIVE WILDLIFE EXPERIENCE.

335
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,435
LET ME ASK YOU

336
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,737
SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT-- IS IT "MARCEL"?

337
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,339
YES.

338
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,641
DOES HE, UH, FIGHT WITH OTHER ANIMALS?

339
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,844
NO, NO. HE'S VERY DOCILE.

340
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:49,848
MMM. EVEN IF HE WERE... CORNERED?

341
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:54,653
WELL, I DON'T KNOW. WHY?

342
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:57,856
UM... HOW IS HE AT HANDLING SMALL OBJECTS?

343
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:01,860
HE CAN HOLD A BANANA, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.

344
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,864
WHAT ABOUT A HAMMER OR A SMALL BLADE?

345
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:12,271
WHY... WHY... WHY... WHY WOULD HE NEED A BLADE?

346
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,273
WELL, IF HE'S UP AGAINST A JUNGLE CAT

347
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,474
OR AN ANIMAL WITH HORNS

348
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,476
YOU GOT TO GIVE THE LITTLE GUY

349
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,277
SOMETHING.

350
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:21,480
OTHERWISE, IT'S JUST CRUEL.

351
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,484
 HE GOT INTO SAN DIEGO.

352
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,485
WHAT?

353
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,087
WE CAME BACK FROM OUR WALK.

354
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,688
THE PHONE WAS RINGING.

355
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,290
HE'S IN!

356
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,692
AH, DID YOU HEAR THAT, MARCEL?

357
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,895
OH! SAN DIEGO! SAN DIEGO!

358
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,897
YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE HERE.

359
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:42,901
I MEAN, SAN DIEGO'S ALL VERY WELL AND GOOD, BUT IF YOU GIVE HIM TO ME

360
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,704
I'LL START HIM OFF AGAINST A BLIND RABBIT AND GIVE YOU

361
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,306
20% OF THE GATE.

362
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,625
? YO HO! ?

363
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,627
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?

364
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,130
MONICA AND I JUST CRASHED AN EMBASSY PARTY.

365
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:15,434
I THINK I KISSED AN ARCHBISHOP.

366
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:19,438
BUT OF COURSE, IT COULD'VE BEEN A CHEF.

367
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,642
ARE YOU DRUNK?

368
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,244
NO!

369
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:33,652
I'M LYING. I AM SO DRUNK...

370
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:34,453
OH, GOD.

371
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,455
GREAT, MONICA. YOU KNOW WHAT?

372
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,057
YOU COULD HAVE CALLED.

373
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,258
I'VE BEEN UP HERE, I'VE BEEN WORRIED...

374
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:40,859
MONICA!

375
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,561
MONICA?

376
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,165
AH...

377
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,567
WATER RULES!

378
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,670
YES, YES, IT DOES.

379
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,873
OKAY, LOOK. THE RESTAURANT CALLED AGAIN TODAY.

380
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:58,477
THEY WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'LL BE SHOWING UP FOR WORK?

381
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:02,081
NOPE. I'M GOING TO THE BIG APPLE CIRCUS TODAY.

382
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,682
OKAY, MONICA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

383
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,684
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR JOB.

384
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:06,885
THIS IS NOT YOU.

385
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:08,087
NO, IT IS ME.

386
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:12,091
I'M NOT JUST THE PERSON WHO NEEDS TO FLUFF THE PILLOWS

387
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,493
AND PAY THE BILLS AS SOON AS THEY COME IN.

388
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:19,298
YOU KNOW, WHEN I'M WITH HER, I AM SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

389
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,101
I'M...

390
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,103
I'M MONANA.

391
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:29,708

392
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,310
HELLO?

393
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,511
YES, SHE IS.

394
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,513
HOLD ON A SECOND, PLEASE.

395
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,915
"MONANA..." IT'S FOR YOU.

396
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,718
THE CREDIT CARD PEOPLE.

397
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,720
HELLO.

398
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,525
YES?

399
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,726
OH, MY GOD.

400
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,529
THANKS.

401
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,931
WHAT?

402
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:56,135
THEY'VE ARRESTED MONICA.

403
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,446
HI.

404
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,248
HEY.

405
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,048
HOW ARE YOU?

406
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,250
I'M NOT TOO BAD.

407
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,652
FORTUNATELY, BLUE'S MY COLOR.

408
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,455
HOW DID YOU KNOW

409
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,056
I WAS HERE?

410
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:22,461
BECAUSE... I'M MONICA GELLER.

411
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:26,064
IT WAS MY CREDIT CARD YOU WERE USING.

412
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,867
THAT, I WAS NOT EXPECTING.

413
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,670
I WANT YOU TO KNOW IT WASN'T ME

414
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,672
WHO TURNED YOU IN.

415
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,473
OH... THANKS.

416
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,574
NO... THANK YOU.

417
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,576
YOU HAVE GIVEN ME SO MUCH.

418
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,777
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU

419
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:42,781
I WOULD HAVE NEVER GOTTEN TO SING "MEMORIES" ON THE STAGE

420
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,383
AT THE WINTERGARDEN THEATER.

421
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,785
WELL, ACTUALLY, YOU ONLY GOT

422
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:47,986
TO SING "MEMO..."

423
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,789
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE IN HERE.

424
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,991
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITHOUT YOU?

425
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,794
WHO'S GOING TO CRASH THE EMBASSY PARTIES WITH ME

426
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,197
OR WHO'S GOING TO TAKE ME TO THE BIG APPLE CIRCUS?

427
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,199
MONICA, I STARTED MY DAY

428
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,001
BY PEEING IN FRONT OF 25 OTHER WOMEN

429
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:06,605
AND YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHO'S GOING TO TAKE YOU

430
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,607
TO THE BIG APPLE CIRCUS?

431
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:12,211
WELL, NOT WORRIED... YOU KNOW, JUST WONDERING.

432
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,414
THERE'S NOTHING TO WONDER ABOUT, MONICA.

433
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,816
YOU'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO BEING EXACTLY WHO YOU WERE

434
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,418
BECAUSE THAT'S WHO YOU ARE.

435
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,019
NOT NECESSARILY.

436
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,221
YES, NECESSARILY.

437
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,822
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

438
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:25,424
MAYBE IT'S THE AMISH THING.

439
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:31,430
UM... I'M NOT ACTUALLY AMISH.

440
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,233
REALLY? THEN WHY ARE YOU LIKE THAT?

441
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,050
YOU BY THE DOOR, IN OR OUT?

442
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,953
IN.

443
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,661
YOU IN THE BACK, YOU'RE GETTING IT ALL WRONG.

444
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,663
BUT AT LEAST I'M DOING IT.

445
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:23,081
This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego

446
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,083
boarding at Gate 42A.

447
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,287
OKAY, GOOD BYE, LITTLE MONKEY GUY.

448
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,289
I WROTE YOU THIS POEM.

449
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,490
OH...

450
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,693
OKAY, BUT DON'T EAT IT TILL YOU GET ON THE PLANE.

451
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,095
"THANK YOU, AUNT PHOEBE."

452
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,697
OH...

453
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,100
OKAY, BYE, CHAMP.

454
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,905
NOW, I KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF BABES IN SAN DIEGO

455
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:50,509
BUT REMEMBER, THERE'S ALSO A LOT TO LEARN.

456
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,216
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, ROSS.

457
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,418
IT'S A MONKEY.

458
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:03,422
OH, JUST... JUST SAY WHAT YOU FEEL, JOEY.

459
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,824
MARCEL, I'M HUNGRY.

460
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,526
THAT WAS GOOD.

461
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,331
MARCEL, THIS IS FOR YOU.

462
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,333
IT'S, UH...

463
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:19,938
JUST, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING TO, UH... DO ON THE PLANE.

464
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:23,642
IF YOU GUYS DON'T MIND

465
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:26,044
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT-- JUST ME AND HIM.

466
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,446
OH, SURE. OF COURSE. ABSOLUTELY.

467
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,246
YEAH, GO AHEAD.

468
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,250
OH! UH...

469
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,254
MARCEL, COME HERE, COME HERE.

470
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,856
COME HERE.

471
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,460
WELL, BUDDY... THIS IS IT.

472
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:46,264
THERE'S JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS I WANTED TO SAY.

473
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,669
I'M REALLY GOING TO MISS YOU

474
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:54,272
AND I'M NEVER GOING TO FORGET ABOUT YOU.

475
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:58,276
YOU'VE BEEN MORE THAN JUST A PET TO ME.

476
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,278
YOU'VE BEEN... YOU'VE BEEN...

477
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,280
MORE LIKE A...

478
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:06,485
MARCEL, WOULD YOU LEAVE MY LEG ALONE?

479
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:09,888
WOULD YOU JUST STOP HUMPING ME FOR TWO SECONDS?

480
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,290
MARCEL... OKAY, WOULD YOU...? JUST TAKE HIM AWAY.

481
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,091
JUST TAKE HIM.

482
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:17,696
? AND I DON'T KNOW HOW ?

483
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:21,299
? BUT YOU'RE A BIG BOY NOW ?

484
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,804
? AND I DON'T KNOW HOW ?

485
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:30,208
? BUT YOU'RE BIG BOY NOW ?

486
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,910
? MM MM... ?

487
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:40,419
OH, THAT I WERE A GLOVE UPON THAT HAND

488
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,622
THAT I MIGHT... TOUCH THY CHEEK.

489
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,824
THAT'S FINE. THANK YOU.

490
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,826
NEXT.

491
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,631
HI. I'LL BE READING

492
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,232
FOR THE ROLE OF MERCUTIO.

493
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:55,834
NAME?

494
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,937
HOLDEN McGROIN.
