1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:04,504
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,007
1999. THE YEAR OF JOEY.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,508
YEAH.

4
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,010
WE'RE VERY HAPPY FOR YOU.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,511
WHAT'S T HE MATTER?

6
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,514
WE WANTED TO KISS AT MIDNIGHT, BUT NOBODY ELSE IS GOING TO

7
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,515
.
SO, YOU KNOW..

8
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,017
ALL RIGHT. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

9
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,519
JOEY... IT'S 30 SECONDS TO MIDNIGHT.

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,021
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

11
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,022
WILL YOU JUST TRUST ME?

12
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,025
33... 32... 31...

13
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,526
ROSS! ROSS ! ROSS, LISTEN.

14
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,528
WHO ARE YOU KISSING AT MIDNIGHT, HUH, RACHEL OR PHOEBE?

15
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,031
WHAT? WELL, YOU GOT TO KISS SOMEONE. CAN'T KISS YOUR SISTER.

16
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,532
WELL, WHO'S GOING TO KISS MY SISTER?

17
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,534
CHANDLER. OH, MAN. REALLY?

18
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,536
DUDE, DUDE, WHO WOULD  YOU RATHER HAVE KISS YOUR SISTER, ME OR CHANDLER?

19
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,038
THAT'S A GOOD POINT. YEAH.

20
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,540
UH, WELL SINCE I HAVE THAT WHOLE HISTORY

21
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,042
WITH RACHEL, I GUESS PHOEBE.

22
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,043
OKAY. GREAT.

23
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,544
PHEEBS! PHEEBS! LISTEN--

24
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,047
ROSS WANTS TO KISS YOU AT MIDNIGHT.

25
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,048
IT'S SO OBVIOUS.

26
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,050
WHY DOESN'T HE JUST ASK?

27
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,551
RACH... RACH, LISTEN.

28
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,053
I'M GOING TO KISS YOU AT MIDNIGHT.    

29
00:00:53,053 -> 00:00:54,054
WHAT? EVERYONE'S GOT TO KISS SOMEONE.

30
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,555
CAN'T KISS ROSS. YOU GOT THE HISTORY.

31
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,556
SO? SO, WHO WOULD YOU RATHER

32
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,558
HAVE KISSING YOU, ME OR CHANDLER?

33
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,559
OH, GOOD POINT.

34
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,560
YEAH.

35
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,563
 THREE... TWO... ONE...

36
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,065
HAPPY NEW YEAR!

37
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,567

38
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,572
HAPPY NEW YEAR.

39
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,573
HAPPY NEW YEAR.

40
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,075
HAPPY NEW YEAR, PHEEBS. YOU, TOO.

41
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,576
HAPPY NEW YEAR, JOEY.

42
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,079
SO, THAT DO ANYTHING FOR YOU?

56
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,628
YOU KNOW WHAT?

57
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,630
I'M GOING TO GO OUT ON A LIMB

58
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,633
AND SAY NO DIVORCES IN '99!

59
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,634
YEAH, BABY!

60
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,136

61
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,138
BUT YOU'RE DIVORCE ISN'T EVEN FINAL YET.

62
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,639
JUST THE ONE DIVORCE IN 99S!

63
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,640
YEAH, BABY!

64
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,142

65
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,143
YOU KNOW WHAT?

66
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,145
I AM GOING TO BE HAPPY THIS YEAR.

67
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,147
I AM GOING TO MAKE MYSELF HAPPY.

68
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,150
DO YOU WANT US TO LEAVE THE ROOM OR...?

69
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,152
EVERY DAY, I AM GOING TO DO ONE THING

70
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,154
I HAVE NEVER DONE BEFORE.

71
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,157
THAT, MY FRIENDS, IS MY NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION.

72
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,658
OOH! THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

73
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,160
YEAH.

74
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,162
MINE IS TO PILOT A COMMERCIAL JET.

75
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,163
OH...

76
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,664
THAT'S A GOOD ONE, TOO, PHEEBS.

77
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,167
NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS FIND A PLANELOAD OF PEOPLE

78
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,669
WHOSE RESOLUTION IS TO PLUMMET TO THEIR DEATHS.

79
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,173
MAYBE YOUR RESOLUTION SHOULD BE NOT TO MAKE FUN OF YOUR FRIENDS

80
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,175
ESPECIALLY THE ONES WHO MAY SOON

81
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,178
BE FLYING YOU TO EUROPE FOR FREE ON THEIR OWN PLANE.

82
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,680
SHE HAS A BETTER CHANCE OF SPROUTING WINGS

83
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,182
AND FLYING UP YOUR NOSE

84
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,684
THAN YOU DO OF NOT MAKING FUN OF US.

85
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,187
IN FACT, I'LL BET YOU 50 BUCKS YOU CAN'T GO THE WHOLE YEAR

86
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,688
WITHOUT MAKING FUN OF US.

87
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,190
YOU KNOW WHAT? BETTER YET-- A WEEK.

88
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,192
I'LL TAKE THAT BET, MY FRIEND.

89
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,693
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

90
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:17,197
PAYING ME THE 50 BUCKS CAN BE THE "NEW THING" YOU DO THAT DAY.

91
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,201
AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

92
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,704
ALL RIGHT, MY NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION

93
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,206
IS TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY GUITAR.

94
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,208
REALLY? HOW COME?

95
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,210
WELL, YOU KNOW THOSE, UH, SPECIAL SKILLS

96
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,711
I HAVE LISTED ON MY RESUME?

97
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,715
WELL, I WOULD LOVE IT IF ONE OF THOSE WAS TRUE.

98
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,717
DO YOU WANT ME TO TEACH YOU? I'M A GREAT TEACHER.

99
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,719
OH, REALLY? WHO HAVE YOU TAUGHT?

100
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,721
WELL, I TAUGHT  ME AND I LOVED ME.

101
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,224
OH, THAT'D BE GREAT.

102
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,725
YEAH. THANKS, PHEEBS.

103
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,228
MY RESOLUTION IS TO BE LESS OBSESSED

104
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,729
WITH BEING NEAT AND CLEAN.

105
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:50,730
REALLY?

106
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,232
HUH...

107
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,233
NO!

108
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,240
OR SOMETHING ELSE.

109
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,743
OH, LOOK-- BLAIR FORGOT HER GLASSES

110
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,745
AND SHE'S GOING TO REALLY BE NEEDING THESE

111
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,747
TO KEEP AN EYE ON THAT BOYFRIEND

112
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,249
WHO, FROM WHAT I HEAR

113
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,751
NEEDS TO KEEP HIS STAPLER IN HIS DESK DRAWER

114
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,254
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

115
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,256
HEY, RACH, MAYBE YOUR RESOLUTION SHOULD BE

116
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,757
TO, UM... GOSSIP LESS.

117
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,759
I DON'T GOSSIP.

118
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,761

119
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,764
MAYBE SOMETIMES I FIND OUT THINGS

120
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:28,268
OR I HEAR SOMETHING AND I PASS THAT INFORMATION ON.

121
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,770
YOU KNOW, KIND OF LIKE A PUBLIC SERVICE.

122
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,772
DOESN'T MEAN I'M A GOSSIP.

123
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,275
I MEAN, WOULD YOU CALL TED KOPPEL A GOSSIP?

124
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,776
WELL, IF TED KOPPEL TALKED ABOUT

125
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,779
HIS COWORKER'S BOTCHED BOOB JOBS, YEAH, I WOULD.

126
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,781
THEY WERE LIKE THIS!

127
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,785
ALL RIGHT, OKAY, FINE.

128
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,788
FINE. MY NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION WILL BE NOT TO GOSSIP.

129
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,789
IT'S EASY.

130
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,790
OH, EASY?

131
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,792
YOU HAVE NEVER KEPT A RESOLUTION.

132
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,793
YES, I HAVE.

133
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,795
OKAY, LET'S SEE HOW YOU DID LAST YEAR.

134
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,297
NO. NO, NOT MY DIARY.

135
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,299
NO, YOU CANNOT READ MY DIARY.

136
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,301
"DEAR DIARY, I'M SO EXCITED.

137
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,804
"MY RESOLUTION IS TO WRITE  IN YOU EVERY DAY.

138
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,806
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW!"

139
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,308
NOTHING.

140
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,314
YOU KNOW, NOT A LOT HAPPENED LAST YEAR.

141
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,316
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, I WILL PROVE TO YOU

142
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,817
THAT I CAN KEEP IT THIS TIME.

143
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,818
NO MORE GOSSIPING.

144
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,819
 I HATE GOSSIP.

145
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,321
IN JUNIOR HIGH, THIS GIRL SAID

146
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,824
A LOT OF MEAN STUFF ABOUT ME, AND I SET HER BIKE ON FIRE.

147
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,826
WOW, WHAT DID  SHE SAY ABOUT YOU?

148
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,828
SHE SAID I WAS CRAZY.

149
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,331
BUT I GUESS SHE GOT HERS, HUH? YAH HA!

150
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,837
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

151
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,838
OKAY.

152
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,341
HEY.

153
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,342
HEY HEY.

154
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,843
I JUST ASKED THAT GIRL OUT.

155
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:44,844
NICE.

156
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:45,845
NICE... YEAH.

157
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,347
IS THAT PART OF YOUR RESOLUTION?

158
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,848
YOUR "NEW THING" FOR TODAY?

159
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,849
YES, IT IS.

160
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,850
SEE?

161
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,352
"ELIZABETH...

162
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,354
...HORNSWOGGLE"?

163
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,357
THAT'S RIGHT.

164
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,361
ELIZABETH... HORNSWOGGLE.

165
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,365
HORN... SWOGGLE?

166
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,867
YOU OKAY, CHANDLER?

167
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,868
IS THERE SOMETHING...?

168
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,371
SOMETHING FUNNY ABOUT THAT NAME?

169
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,373
NO. NO. I JUST THINK THAT MAYBE I'VE...

170
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,375
I'VE HEARD IT SOMEWHERE BEFORE.

171
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,380
OH, REALLY? WHERE?

172
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,383
SOMEWHERE FUNNY, I'LL BET.

173
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:25,885
HEY...

174
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:26,886
GUESS WHAT?

175
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,388
I HAVE A DATE WITH, UH...

176
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,890
ELIZABETH HORNSWOGGLE.

177
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,893
HORNSWOGGLE?

178
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,396
OH, THIS MUST BE KILLING YOU.

179
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,398
ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU LATER.

180
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,900
NOT REALLY.

181
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,403
I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU HER MIDDLE NAME.

182
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,904
WELL, DON'T-- JUST DON'T.

183
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,905
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

184
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,407
SEE YOU.

185
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,909
ALL RIGHT, PHEEBS, I AM READY FOR MY FIRST LESSON.

186
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:50,910
OKAY.

187
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,412
OH, NO, NO.

188
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,913
YOU DON'T TOUCH THE GUITAR.

189
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,415
NO. NO. FIRST, YOU LEARN HERE.

190
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,916
THEN YOU LEARN HERE.

191
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,918
OH... OKAY.

192
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,920
OKAY--

193
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,921
LESSON ONE.

194
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,423
CHORDS.

195
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,427
NOW, UM, I DON'T KNOW THE ACTUAL NAMES OF THE CHORDS

196
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,429
UM, BUT I I I

197
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,931
MADE UP NAMES FOR THE WAY MY HAND LOOKS

198
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,932
WHILE I'M DOING THEM.

199
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,435
SO, THEN

200
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,437
THIS IS "BEAR CLAW."

201
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,940
"OKAY. UM, "TURKEY LEG...

202
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,943
AND "OLD LADY."

203
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,949
WHAT AN INTERESTING APPROACH TO GUITAR INSTRUCTION.

204
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,453
YOU KNOW, SOME MIGHT FIND IT AMUSING.

205
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,954
I, MYSELF, FIND IT REGULAR.

206
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,461
HEY, EVERYBODY. RACHEL WAS SO GOOD TODAY.

207
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,962
SHE DIDN'T GOSSIP AT ALL.

208
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,464
I DIDN'T. EVEN WHEN I FOUND OUT...

209
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,466
UM... ALL RIGHT...

210
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,467
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY

211
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,469
I FOUND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT SOMEONE

212
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,472
AND LET'S JUST SAY... SHE'S GOING TO KEEP IT.

213
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,475
HEY, PHEEBS.

214
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,976
CHECK THIS OUT.

215
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,483
OOH! YOU YOU NAILED THE "OLD LADY."

216
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,984
OH!

217
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,489
YEAH...

218
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,490
YEAH. LISTEN, SO--

219
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,991
I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING BETTER

220
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,992
SO, ON MY WAY HOME TODAY

221
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,994
I STOPPED BY THIS GUITAR STORE AND...

222
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,996
DID YOU DID YOU TOUCH ANY OF THE GUITARS

223
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,997
WHILE YOU WERE THERE?

224
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,999
DID YOU?

225
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,503
NO.

226
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,506
GIVE ME YOUR HANDS.

227
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,509
STRINGS.

228
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,510
GIVE IT.

229
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,011
PICK.

230
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,012
OH!

231
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,016
DO YOU WANT TO LEARN TO PLAY GUITAR?

232
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,017
YES.

233
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,519
THEN DON'T TOUCH ONE!

234
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,522
HI.

235
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,023
HI!

236
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,525
HI, BEN!

237
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,527
AUNTIE MONKIE!

238
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,029
ROSS IS WEARING LEATHER PANTS!

239
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,037
DOES NOBODY ELSE SEE THAT ROSS IS WEARING LEATHER PANTS?

240
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,040
SOMEONE! COMMENT ON THE PANTS!

241
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,543
I THINK THEY'RE VERY NICE.

242
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,544
I REALLY LIKE THEM.

243
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,045
YEAH. NICE STUFF.

244
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,549
NOT WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

245
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,551
SEE, PEOPLE LIKE ROSS

246
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,053
DON'T GENERALLY WE AR THESE TYPES OF PANTS.

247
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,055
YOU SEE, THEY'RE VERY TIGHT.

248
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,559
MAYBE THERE'S  SOMETHING IN THAT AREA.

249
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,060
THEY LOOK GOOD. I LIKE THEM.

250
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,061
WAY TO GO.

251
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,563
THEY LOOK GREAT.

252
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,064
WHERE DID  YOU GET THEM?

253
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,567
DAY SEE, I... I NEEDED A NEW THING FOR TO

254
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,069
BY AND THERE'S THIS LEATHER STORE I GO

255
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,571
THAT ALWAYS SMELLS SO GOOD.

256
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,072
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, WOW.

257
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,574
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER OWNED

258
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:39,078
A REALLY GOOD SMELLING PAIR OF PANTS BEFORE.

259
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,583
OH, COME ON!

260
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,589
OKAY, SERIOUSLY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

261
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,090
AWFUL. ABSOLUTELY AWFUL.

262
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,091
YEAH. AWFUL.

263
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,596
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

264
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,597
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

265
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,598
IT'S MY NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION.

266
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,099
TO BLIND MY CHILD?

267
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,602
NO. TO TAKE MORE PICTURES OF ALL OF US TOGETHER.

268
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,104
I MEAN, I REALLY THINK IT'S THE BEST RESOLUTION

269
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,606
BECAUSE EVERYONE CAN ENJOY THE PICTURES.

270
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,609
WELL, EVERYONE WILL ENJOY MY MUSIC AS WELL.

271
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,121
 OH, MY GOD.

272
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,124
THESE PANTS-- I'M BURNING UP.

273
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,128
SHE WANTS TO SNUGGLE NOW?

274
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,130
WHAT? IS SHE TRYING TO KILL ME?

275
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,133
IT'S LIKE A VOLCANO IN HERE.

276
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,636
ARE YOU HOT?

277
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,137
NO.

278
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,140
OKAY. MUST JUST BE ME, THEN.

279
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,647

280
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,156
THAT WAS JUST THE PANTS ON THE COUCH.

281
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,662
UM, HEY, DO YOU DO YOU MIND IF I USE YOUR BATHROOM?

282
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,663
OH, GO AHEAD.

283
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,664
THANKS.

284
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,666

285
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,682

286
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,203
AH...

287
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,705
HEY!

288
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,206
MY FAVORITE PART'S COMING UP!

289
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,708
OKAY.

290
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,226
OH, MY GOD!

291
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,231
"TIGER."

292
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,733
"DRAGON."

293
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,735
"ICEBERG."

294
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,738
JOSEPH, DID YOU EVEN STUDY AT ALL LAST NIGHT?

295
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,740
YES. YES, I DID.

296
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,241
THEN DO "ICEBERG."

297
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,243
"G" SHARP.

298
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,245
"G" SHARP?

299
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,249
HAVE YOU BEEN STUDYING THE REAL NAMES OF THE CHORDS?

300
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,752
HAVE YOU?

301
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,755
OH, MY GOD.

302
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,257
WHAT? I I DIDN'T TOUCH A GUITAR!

303
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,759
NO, BUT YOU'RE QUESTIONING MY METHOD.

304
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,261
NO. I'M NOT QUESTIONING IT, PHOEBE.

305
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,262
I'M SAYING IT'S STUPID!

306
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,764
WHAT?

307
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,267
THANK YOU.

308
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,771
YOU KNOW, NONE OF MY OTHER STUDENT

309
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,273
THOUGHT I WAS STUPID!

310
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,276
YOUR OTHER STUDENT WAS YOU!

311
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,783
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU JUST NEED  TO TRY A LITTLE HARDER.

312
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,284
MAYBE I NEED TO TRY A REAL TEACHER!

313
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,286
RIGHT HERE. HERE. ANDY COOPER.

314
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,287
HE TEACHES GUITAR.

315
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,790
AND LOOK. OOH, THERE'S A NICE PICTURE OF HIM

316
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,791
WITH A LITTLE KID, YEAH.

317
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,793
AND THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!

318
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,796
FINE!

319
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,298
YOU GO LEARN FROM YOUR... QUALIFIED INSTRUCTOR!

320
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,800
BUT DON'T COME CRYING TO ME

321
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,301
WHEN EVERYONE IS SICK AND TIRED

322
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,804
OF HEARING YOU PLAY "BAD, BAD, LEROY BROWN."

323
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,808
?? BADDEST MAN IN THE WHOLE DAMN TOWN... ??

324
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,310
OH, FINE. TAKE HIS SIDE!

325
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,819
 I can't wait to be with you.

326
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,321
I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben.

327
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,823
I'll just tell Rachel

328
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,325
I'm going to be doing laundry for a couple of hours.

329
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,328
 Laundry? Huh. Is that my new nickname?

330
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,834
 You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...

331
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,335

332
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,848
 WOULD YOU STOP LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT?

333
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,851
PHOEBE WAS A TERRIBLE TEACHER.

334
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,853
I WASN'T LEARNING ANYTHING FROM HER.

335
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,855
LOOK, I FEEL BAD... AW, FORGET IT.

336
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,857
WE'RE GOING AROUND IN CIRCLES.

337
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,358

338
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,361
AW, GO ON, ON.

339
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,362
HELLO.

340
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,365
JOEY, IT'S ROSS. I NEED SOME HELP.

341
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,367
UH, CHANDLER'S NOT HERE.

342
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,369
WELL, YOU CAN HELP ME.

343
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,372
OKAY.

344
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,374
LISTEN, I'M IN ELIZABETH'S BATHROOM...

345
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,877
NICE.

346
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,379
NO, I GOT REALLY HOT IN MY LEATHER PANTS

347
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,881
SO I TOOK THEM OFF

348
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,384
BUT THEY MUST HAVE SHRUNK FROM THE SWEAT OR SOMETHING

349
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,888
OR MY LEGS EXPANDED FROM THE HEAT.

350
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,391
BUT I CAN'T GET THEM BACK ON, JOEY.

351
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,392
I CAN'T!

352
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,395
OH, THAT IS QUITE A SITUATION.

353
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,900
UH, DO YOU SEE ANY, LIKE, POWDER?

354
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,402
POWDER, YEAH, YEAH.

355
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,403
I HAVE POWDER.

356
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,905
Good, good, okay.

357
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,906
SPRINKLE SOME OF THAT ON YOUR LEGS.

358
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,407
IT WILL ABSORB SOME OF THE MOISTURE

359
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,409
AND THEN YOU CAN GET YOUR PANTS ON.

360
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,911
OKAY, HOLD ON.

361
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,436
THEY'RE NOT COMING ON, MAN.

362
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:42,441
UH... OH! OH! OKAY, CUT SLITS IN THE PANTS, RIGHT?

363
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,944
THEN PUT THEM BACK ON, GO OUT THERE

364
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,947
AND TELL HER YOU'RE THE INCREDIBLE HULK.

365
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,950
CHANDLER'S NOT THERE, HUH?

366
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,954
WELL, THAT WOULD HAVE WORKED, BUT ALL RIGHT, FINE.

367
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,957
UM, YOU SEE ANY... OH, VASELINE?

368
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,960
I... I SEE LOTION.

369
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,461
I HAVE LOTION.

370
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,963
WILL THAT WORK?

371
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,965
YEAH, SURE. THROW SOME OF THAT ON THERE.

372
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,466
Hold on.

373
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,489
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S WORKING.

374
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,490
THEY'RE STILL...

375
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,993
THEY'RE STILL NOT COMING ON, MAN.

376
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,496
AND THE LOTION AND THE POWDER HAVE MADE A PASTE.

377
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,998
REALLY?

378
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,501
UH, WHAT COLOR IS IT?

379
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:46,005
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THAT MAKE?

380
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,007
WELL, IF THE PASTE MATCHES THE PANTS

381
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,009
YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF A PAIR OF PASTE PANTS

382
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,011
AND SHE WON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

383
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,014
JOEY, DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

384
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,515
DUDE, WHAT AM I...?

385
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,517
RACHEL'S HERE. SO GOOD LUCK, MAN.

386
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,019
LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS OUT.

387
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,023
OH, JOEY, I HAVE SUCH A PROBLEM.

388
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,525
WELL, YOUR TIMING COULDN'T BE BETTER.

389
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:10,029
I AM PUTTING OUT FIRES ALL OVER THE PLACE TODAY.

390
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,530
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

391
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,034
JOEY, I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

392
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,035
WHAT? WHAT IS IT? WHAT IS IT?

393
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,536
OH, MY GOD, IT'S SO HUGE.

394
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,038
BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO PROMISE ME-

395
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,039
YOU CANNOT TELL ANYONE.

396
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,041
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

397
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,042
WHAT?

398
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,043
YES, YES, YES.

399
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,544
YOU DO WANT TO KNOW. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

400
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:26,545
I DON'T CARE, RACH.

401
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,547
LOOK, I AM TIRED OF BEING THE GUY

402
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,050
WHO KNOWS ALL THE SECRETS AND CAN'T TELL ANYONE.

403
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,551
WHAT SECRETS? YOU KNOW SECRETS? WHAT ARE THEY?

404
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,553
AND YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE GOSSIPING.

405
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,055
I KNOW, I JUST CAN'T KEEP THIS ONE IN.

406
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,556
SO I PICK UP THE PHONE...

407
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,558

408
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,062
?? LA LA LA LA LA! ??

409
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,064
I'M NOT LISTENING TO YOU.

410
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,565
?? AH AH AH AH! ??

411
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,567
?? AH! ??

412
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:53,572
?? AH... LA LA LA LA! ??

413
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,573

414
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:05,084
ROSS, UM, YOU'VE BEEN IN THERE FOR A LONG TIME.

415
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,087
I'M STARTING TO GET KIND OF FREAKED OUT.

416
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,589
ALL RIGHT, I'M COMING OUT.

417
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,093
HEY, CAN YOU TURN THE LIGHTS OFF?

418
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,596
NO.

419
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,100
LET'S JUST LEAVE THE LIGHTS ON.

420
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,111
OH, MY GOD.

421
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,114
I HAD A PROBLEM.

422
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,121
HEY, PHEEBS.

423
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,123
OH, I CAN'T TALK TO YOU.

424
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,626
I DON'T HAVE A FANCY AD IN THE YELLOW PAGES.

425
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,130
LOOK, PHEEBS, I JUST...

426
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,631
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.

427
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:56,635
FOR SAYING YOUR METHOD WAS STUPID

428
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,637
AND MAYBE...

429
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,640
ASK YOU TO BE MY TEACHER AGAIN?

430
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,642
AND AND I PROMISE I WON'T TOUCH A GUITAR

431
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,644
UNTIL YOU SAY I'M READY.

432
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,654
YOU REALLY THINK I'M READY?

433
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,156
UH HUH.

434
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,658
WOW. COOL!

435
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,661
OKAY.

436
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,665

437
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,181
WAS THE CHORD AT LEAST RIGHT BEFORE...?

438
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,682
NO.

439
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,692
OH, MY GOD!

440
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,195
WE HEARD ABOUT YOUR PANTS.

441
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,196
I'M SO SORRY.

442
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,199
THIS YEAR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE GREAT.

443
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,201
WELL, IT'S ONLY THE SECOND DAY

444
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:06,205
AND I'M A LOSER WITH STUPID LEATHER PANTS

445
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,207
THAT DON'T EVEN FIT!

446
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,708
NO, YOU'RE NOT A LOSER.

447
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,210

448
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,712
LOOK AT ME!

449
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,214

450
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,221
HEY, HEY, LOOK. LOOK, ROSS.

451
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,723
BEN DREW A PICTURE OF YOU.

452
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,225
HUH? YOU'RE A COWBOY.

453
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,729
OH.

454
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,732
BE BECAUSE OF THE LEATHER PANTS?

455
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,735
SEE? BEN DOESN'T THINK YOU'RE A LOSER.

456
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,237
HE THINKS YOU'RE A COWBOY.

457
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,738
I MEAN, THAT'S SOMETHING.

458
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,240

459
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,742
HOWDY, PARTNER. HEY HEY.

460
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,744
MAYBE I SHOULD GET ANOTHER PAIR.

461
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,748
OOH! YOU KNOW, THEY HAD SOME WITH, UH...

462
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:53,252
WITH FRINGE ALL DOWN THE SIDES.

463
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:57,756
PHEEBS, YOU MAY KNOW THIS-- YOU KNOW STRANGE THINGS--

464
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,759
WHAT IS THE BOILING POINT OF BRAIN?

465
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,262
I USED TO KNOW THIS.

466
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,765
I'M GOING TO GO KISS BEN GOOD NIGHT.

467
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:15,274
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE THINKS I'M A COWBOY.

468
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,776
I WOULD MAKE A GOOD COWBOY.

469
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,782
OKAY, NOW THAT EVERYTHING'S WRAPPED UP HERE

470
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,785
I THINK I'M GOING TO GO DO MY LAUNDRY.

471
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,287
ME, TOO, YOU KNOW,  IF THIS SHIRT IS DIRTY.

472
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,788
YEP.

473
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,297
HEY, I'M GOING TO GO, TOO.

474
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,798
I'M GOING TO GO TO THE AIRPORT.

475
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,301
I FIGURE IF I HANG AROUND THERE LONG ENOUGH

476
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,304
SOMEONE'S BOUND TO LEAVE ONE OF THOSE PLANES UNATTENDED.

477
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,306
GOOD LUCK, HONEY. BYE.

478
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,308

479
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,810
WOW.

480
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,312
HEY, UH, JOEY, REMEMBER THAT BIG THING

481
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,813
I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT?

482
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,814
OH, NO.

483
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,816

484
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,818
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU

485
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,820
BUT IF YOU FOUND OUT ON YOUR OWN

486
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,323
THAT WOULD BE OKAY, AND THEN WE COULD TALK ABOUT IT, RIGHT?

487
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,325
WELL, THEN IT WOULDN'T BE A SECRET

488
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,327
SO, YEAH, THAT WOULD BE OKAY.

489
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,328
YEAH, YEAH.

490
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,830
YEAH.

491
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,333
HEY, UH, JOE, WOULD YOU MIND GOING OVER

492
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,835
INTO CHANDLER'S BEDROOM AND GETTING THAT BOOK BACK

493
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,338
THAT HE BORROWED FROM ME?

494
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,843
NOW? YOU WANT ME TO GO OVER THERE NOW?

495
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,345
HMM.

496
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,347
DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

497
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,349
DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

498
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,850
I MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING.

499
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,352
I MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING, TOO.

500
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,354
WHAT'S THE THING YOU KNOW?

501
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,855
OH, NO, I CAN'T TELL YOU UNTIL YOU TELL  ME WHAT YOU KNOW.

502
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,856
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW.

503
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,358
WELL, THEN, I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW.

504
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,859
OKAY, FINE.

505
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,369
YOU DON'T KNOW.

506
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,870
ALL RIGHT, HOW ABOUT I GO OVER THERE

507
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,871
AND I WILL WALK INTO CHANDLER'S BEDROOM

508
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,873
AND I WILL SEE THE THING THAT I THINK THAT I KNOW

509
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,375
IS ACTUALLY THE THING THAT I THINK THAT I KNOW.

510
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,376

511
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,877
YOU KNOW!

512
00:22:58,877 --> 00:22:59,878
AND YOU KNOW!

513
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,380
YEAH, I KNOW!

514
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,881
CHANDLER AND MONICA?!

515
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,383
OH, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!

516
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,884
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN?!

517
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,885
TOO LONG!  OH, MY GOD, RACH!

518
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,887
I'VE BEEN DYING TO TALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT THIS

519
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:09,888
FOR SO LONG!

520
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,390
BUT LISTEN, LISTEN.

521
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,891
YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING TO ANYBODY.

522
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,393
THEY'RE SO WEIRD ABOUT THAT.

523
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,394
LISTEN...

524
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,395

525
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,896
HEY, PHOEBE!

526
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,398
HEY. IT'S RAINING.

527
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,900
I DON'T LIKE TO FLY IN THE RAIN, SO...

528
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,404
OH!

529
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,906
I AM GOING TO GO FOR A WALK IN THE RAIN.

530
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,408
OH, YEAH, ME, TOO.

531
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,414
THAT'S WEIRD.

532
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,916
I BET THEY'RE DOING IT.

533
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,924
OH, GOOD. OKAY, LOOK, I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

534
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,427
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE, SO YOU WIN, OKAY? HERE.

535
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,428
PHEEBS, FLYING A JET?

536
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,430
BETTER MAKE IT A SPACESHIP

537
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,932
SO YOU CAN GET BACK TO YOUR HOME PLANET.

538
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,436
AND ROSS, PHONE CALL FOR YOU TODAY.

539
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,438
TOM JONES-- HE WANTS HIS PANTS BACK!

540
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,940
AND "HORNSWOGGLE"?

541
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,443
WHAT ARE YOU-- DATING A CHARACTER FROM FRAGGLE ROCK?

542
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,945
AHHHH!
