1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,006
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,507
THIS IS SO GOOD...

3
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,009
SO GOOD FOR MONICA.

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,512

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,514
OH, LOOK AT THAT. TIME'S UP. MY TURN.

6
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,018
THAT WAS A HALF AN HOUR?

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,019
IT'S YOUR TIMER.

8
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,023
ALL RIGHT.

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,025
IT YOU KNOW,  I DON'T LIKE  TO BRAG ABOUT

10
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,527
BUT I GIVE, LIKE , THE BEST MASSAGES.

11
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:31,031
ALL RIGHT. THEN MASSAGE ME UP RIGHT NICE.

12
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:35,035
AH! AH! AH!

13
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,536
IT'S SO GOOD, ISN'T IT?

14
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,539
IT'S SO GOOD, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE DONE TO DESERVE IT.

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,044
OH, HEY, NOW STOP TRYING TO ADD MORE TIME TO YOUR MASSAGE.

16
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,046
OW!

17
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,048
SAY GOOD BYE TO SORE MUSCLES.

18
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,050
GOOD BYE, MUSCLES.

32
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:43,103
I'M TELLING YOU, SHE GIVES THE WORST MASSAGES EVER, OKAY?

33
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,106
IT WAS LIKE SHE WAS TORTURING ME FOR INFORMATION

34
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,108
AND I WANTED TO GIVE IT UP.

35
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,610
I JUST... I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS.

36
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,612
LOOK, CHANDLER, IF IT REALLY HURTS THAT BAD

37
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,114
YOU SHOULD JUST TELL HER.

38
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,116
LOOK. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE

39
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,617
I'M IN A REAL RELATIONSHIP, OKAY?

40
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,119
I'M NOT GOING TO SCREW THAT UP

41
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,620
BY, YOU KNOW, TELLING THE TRUTH.

42
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,123
HEY.

43
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,624
WHOA, DUDE, LOOK OUT.

44
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,626
DUDE, YOU ALMOST CRUSHED MY HAT.

45
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,128
I'M I'M SORRY.

46
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,131
AND THE BUNNY GOT AWAY.

47
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,642
THIS WOULD BE THE PLACE WHERE YOU EXPLAIN THE HAT.

48
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,645
OH. OKAY.

49
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:30,150
THIS IS CALLED A TOP HAT.

50
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,654
AND WHY ARE YOU WEARING THIS...

51
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,656
IS IT, "TOP HAT"?

52
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,160
OH, YEAH.

53
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,161
THERE'S THIS PLAY, RIGHT?

54
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,663
AND I'M UP FOR THE PART OF THIS REAL COOL, LIKE.

55
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,166

00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,177

63
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,182
DONE.

64
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,683
JOEY, IF YOU WANT TO LOOK GOOD

65
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,685
WHY DON'T YOU JUST COME DOWN TO THE STORE.

66
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,686
I'LL HELP YOU OUT.

67
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,688
GREAT. THANKS, RACH.

ALL RIGHT.

70
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,195
 HEY, PHEEBS, HOW'S IT GOING?

71
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,196
HEY.

72
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,697
WELL, ONLY OKAY

73
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,699
BECAUSE I JUST GOT BACK FROM THE HOSPIT

74
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,701
IS EVERYTHING OKAY? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

75
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:25,205
NO, NO, NO. I'M FINE. I'M OKAY, BUT MY GRANDMA SORT OF DIED.

76
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,206
 OH, PHEEBS, SORRY.

77
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,708
IT'S OKAY.

78
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,210
I MEAN, SHE HAD A REALLY INCREDIBLE LIFE

79
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,213
AND IT'S NOT LIKE  I'M NEVER GOING TO SEE HER AGAIN, YOU KNOW.

80
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,214
SHE'S GOING TO VISIT.

81
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,717
WELL, MAYBE...

82
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,718
MAYBE SHE'S WITH US RIGHT NOW.

83
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,220
YEAH, RIGHT.

84
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,222
HER FIRST DAY ON A NEW SPIRITUAL PLANE

85
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,724
AND SHE'S GOING TO COME TO THE COFFEEHOUSE.

86
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,226
YOU GUYS, YOU GUYS, I JUST SAW

87
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,228
TWO PEOPLE HAVING SEX IN A CAR RIGHT OUTSIDE.

88
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,733
UH, PHEEBS' GRANDMOTHER JUST DIED.

89
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,235
OH. OH, MY GOD.

90
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,236
I'M SO SORRY.

91
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,237
IT'S OKAY.

92
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,239
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

93
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,741
IT'S KIND OF COOL, BECAUSE IT'S, LIKE...

94
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,244
YOU KNOW, ONE LIFE ENDS AND ANOTHER BEGINS.

95
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,746
NOT THE WAY THEY'RE DOING IT.

96
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,749
WHAT... WHAT HAPPENED?

97
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,751
I'M SORRY. HOW DID SHE DIE?

98
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,753
WELL, OKAY . WE WERE IN THE MARKET

99
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,756
AND SHE BENT DOWN TO GET SOME YOGURT

100
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,759
AND SHE JUST NEVER CAME BACK UP AGAIN.

101
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,261
PHEEBS, I'M SO SORRY.

102
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,262
IT WAS REALLY SWEET.

103
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,763
THE LAST THING SHE SAID TO ME

104
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,765
WAS, "OKAY, DEAR, YOU GO GET THE EGGS

105
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,767
"AND I'M GOING TO GET THE YOGURT

106
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,270
AND WE'LL MEET AT THE CHECKOUT COUNTER."

107
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,771
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

108
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,773
WE WILL MEET AT THE CHECKOUT COUNTER.

109
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,282
JOEY, YOU KNOW THAT SINCE YOU'RE RETURNING

110
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,783
ALL THIS STUFF AFTER THE AUDITION

111
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,286
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WEAR UNDERWEAR.

112
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,290
ALL RIGHT. WELL, YOU BETTER SHOW ME SOME OF THAT, TOO, THEN.

113
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,792
OKAY. IT'S MISSING SOMETHING.

114
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:54,794
OH, I KNOW.

115
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,296
UM, OKAY.

116
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,802
REALLY? A PURSE?

117
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,304
IT'S NOT A PURSE.

118
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,306
IT'S A SHOULDER BAG.

119
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,309
LOOKS LIKE A WOMAN'S PURSE.

120
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,810
NO, JOEY. LOOK, TRUST ME.

121
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,312
I'M TELLING YOU, ALL OF THE MEN

122
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,314
ARE CARRYING THEM IN THE SPRING CATALOG.

123
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,816
LOOK. SEE? LOOK. MEN... CARRYING THE BAG.

124
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,318
SEE? LOOK.

125
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,320
WOMEN CARRYING THE BAG.

126
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,330
BUT IT IS ODD HOW A WOMAN'S PURSE

127
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,333
LOOKS SO GOOD ON ME-- A MAN.

128
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,834
EXACTLY.

129
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,336
UNISEX.

130
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,337
MAYBE YOU NEED SEX.

131
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,339
I HAD SEX A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

132
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,842
NO, NO, JOEY.

133
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,844
"U N I" SEX.

134
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,847
WELL, I AIN'T GONNA SAY "NO" TO THAT.

135
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,857
 WHO IS IT?

136
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,359
IT'S PHOEBE.

137
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,860
OH, GREAT.

138
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,863
OH, YOU.

139
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,365
UM, WHAT'S UP?

140
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:09,369
UM, WELL, I... SORT OF HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.

141
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,870
CAN I COME IN?

142
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,373
UM, YEAH. NO, THANKS.

143
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,876
UM... WELL... UM...

144
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,379
GRANDMA DIED TODAY.

145
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,381
WOW.

146
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,384
DIDN'T SHE DIE, LIKE, FIVE YEARS AGO?

147
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,387
NO, SHE JUST DIED TODAY.

148
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,888
UM, OKAY. WE'RE HAVING

149
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,890
A MEMORIAL SERVICE TOMORROW.

150
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,893
OKAY. I KNOW I WENT TO THAT ALREADY.

151
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,395
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

152
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,397
THEN WHO'S BEEN DEAD FOR FIVE YEARS?

153
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,898
WELL, LOTS OF PEOPLE.

154
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,900
LOOK. ARE YOU COMING

155
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,403
TO THE MEMORIAL SERVICE OR NOT?

156
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,904
UM, NO.

157
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,906
SEE, I ALREADY THOUGHT

158
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:47,907
SHE WAS DEAD

159
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,410
SO I'VE KIND OF MADE MY PEACE WITH IT.

160
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,414
AND, PLUS, I'M GOING TO A CONCERT TOMORROW, SO...

161
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,415
I'D INVITE YOU

162
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,417
BUT I ONLY HAVE TWO TICKETS LEFT.

163
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,420
FINE.

164
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,921
OKAY. ENJOY YOUR CONCERT.

165
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,423
THANKS. ENJOY YOUR FUNERAL

166
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,427
HEY.

167
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,928
HEY.

168
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,438
WOW. YOU LOOK JUST LIKE YOUR SON, MRS. TRIBBIANI.

169
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,939
WHAT?

170
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,442
ARE YOU REFERRING TO MY MAN'S BAG?

171
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,945
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT IT JUST LOOKED GOOD

172
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,947
BUT IT'S PRACTICAL, TOO. CHECK IT OUT.

173
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,949
IT'S GOT COMPARTMENTS FOR ALL YOUR STUFF--

174
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,951
YOUR WALLET, YOUR KEYS, YOUR ADDRESS BOOK...

175
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,952
YOUR MAKEUP.

176
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,456
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THE BAG?

177
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,957
YOUR AUDITION'S NOT TILL TOMORROW

178
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,960
YEAH, BUT SANDWICH TIME IS RIGHT NOW.

179
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,962
JOEY, YOU KNOW YOU GET ANY MUSTARD ON THAT BAG

180
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:43,963
YOU CAN'T RETURN IT.

181
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,965
WHY WOULD I RETURN THIS?

182
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:46,966
I LOVE THIS BAG.

183
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,469
ALL RIGHT. THEN YOU OWE ME $350.

184
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,470
 FINE.

185
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,973
DO YOU TAKE VASA OR MOOSTERCARD?

186
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,476
JOEY...

187
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,977
ALL RIGHT. RELAX. LOOK. I'LL PAY YOU

188
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,479
WITH THE MONEY FROM THE ACTING JOB

189
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,481
I AM DEFINITELY GOING TO GET THANKS TO YOU.

190
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,483
WHAT'S THE PART? AUNTIE MAME?

191
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:05,985
DON'T LISTEN TO THEM.

192
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,487
I THINK IT'S SEXY.

193
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,989
"YOU AND I" SEXY?

194
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,498
OH, HELLO, MRS. PINELLO.

195
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,999
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.

196
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,502
OKAY. HERE'S YOUR 3 D GLASSES.

197
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,507
AND REVEREND PONG WILL TELL YOU WHEN TO PUT THEM ON.

198
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,512
HI, SWEETIE.

199
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,013
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

200
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,014
FINE.

201
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,016
HEY, PHEEBS.

202
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,518
I'M SO SORRY.

203
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,019
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

204
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,022
MY GRANDMA HAD THE EXACT SAME BAG.

205
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,024
HERE. I BROUGHT YOU SOME FLOWERS.

206
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,026
OH, THANKS.

207
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,027
YEAH. PULLING FLOWERS OUT OF IT

208
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,029
MAKES THE BAG LOOK A LOT MORE MASCULINE.

209
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,032
OH, I'M SORRY.

210
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,034
EXCUSE ME. IS THIS THE MEMORIAL?

211
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,536
YEAH. WELCOME.

212
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,537
HELLO.

213
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,038
HERE'S YOUR 3 D GLASSES.

214
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,040
OH... ALL RIGHT.

215
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,044
SO, HOW DID YOU KNOW FRANCES?

216
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,045
WELL, ACTUALLY...

217
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,048
I HADN'T SEEN HER FOR YEARS, BUT, UM...

218
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,552
WELL, I WAS PRETTY TIGHT WITH HER AND HER DAUGHTER.

219
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,053
REALLY? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

220
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,054
FRANK BUFFAY.

221
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,059
YOU KNOW WHAT? STRIKE THAT.

222
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,562
MY NAME... ACTUALLY, IS IS JOE.

223
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,563
UM...

224
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,565
JOE... UH, HILL.

225
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,566
YOU'RE FRANK BUFFAY?

226
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,067
SHH! NO!

227
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,068
JOE HILL!

228
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,571
BUT YOU JUST SAID...

229
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,572
YOU KNOW WHAT? I GOT TO GO

230
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,574
AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.

231
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,577
BUT...

232
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,578
OH, MY GOD.

233
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,079
WHAT?

234
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,080
 WHAT, HONEY?

235
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,582
THAT WAS MY DAD.

236
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,584
OH, MY GOD.

237
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,586
HEY, YOU GUYS, CHECK IT OUT, CHECK IT OUT.

238
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,088
IT'S LIKE IT'S COMING RIGHT AT ME.

239
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,098
DID YOU CATCH HIM?

240
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,099
UH HUH.

241
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,601
WHAT DID HE SAY?

242
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,604
HE SAID, "NICE TO MEET YOU, GLENDA."

243
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,106
WELL, OBVIOUSLY, I COULDN'T GIVE HIM MY REAL NAME.

244
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,608
WHY? WHY NOT?

245
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,109
COME ON, YOU SAW THE WAY HE RAN OUT OF HERE.

246
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,611
WHAT, DO YOU THINK HE'S GONNA STICK AROUND

247
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,112
AND TALK TO THE DAUGHTER HE ABANDONED?

248
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,114
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM?

249
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,618
WELL, I TOLD HIM I WAS THE EXECUTOR PERSON OF FRANCES'S WILL

250
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,620
AND THAT I NEEDED TO TALK TO HIM

251
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,623
SO I'M GOING TO MEET HIM AT THE COFFEEHOUSE LATER.

252
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,124
WOULD EVERYONE PLEASE TAKE THEIR SEATS.

253
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,626
ALL RIGHT.

254
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,127
WELL, I JUST CAN'T THINK ABOUT THAT NOW.

255
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,630
I I JUST WANT TO SAY GOOD BYE TO MY GRANDMA.

256
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,632
OKAY. LET'S GO SAY GOOD BYE.

257
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,144
HEY.

258
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,647
I'M OFF TO MY AUDITION.

259
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,148
HOW DO I LOOK?

260
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,650
I THINK YOU LOOK GREAT.

261
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,652
JOEY, THAT BAG IS GOING TO GET YOU THAT PART.

262
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,653
AND A DATE WITH A MAN.

263
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,155
YOU KNOW WHAT?

264
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,157
MAKE FUN ALL YOU WANT.

265
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,659
THIS IS A GREAT BAG, OKAY?

266
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,161
AND IT'S AS HANDY AS IT IS BECOMING.

267
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,164
NOW, JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING

268
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,667
DOESN'T MAKE IT WRONG, ALL RIGHT?

269
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,169
SO, FROM NOW ON, YOU GUYS ARE GOING

270
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,172
TO HAVE TO GET USED TO THE FACT THAT JOEY COMES WITH A BAG.

271
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,176
I BETTER GO, TOO. I GOT TO GO MEET MY DAD.

272
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,177
OH, PHEEBS, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY?

273
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,178
ARE YOU GOING TO TELL HIM WHO YOU ARE?

274
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,179
NO, NOT AT FIRST

275
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,181
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO FREAK HIM OUT.

276
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,183
BUT AREN'T YOU PISSED AT HIM?

277
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,185
I MEAN, THIS GUY ABANDONED YOU.

278
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,187
I GOT TO TELL YOU, IF IT WERE ME

279
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,690
THIS GUY WOULD BE IN SOME SERIOUS PHYSICAL DANGER.

280
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,192
I I I'D WALK IN THERE...

281
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:39,699
I'D BE, LIKE, "YO, DAD! YOU AND ME OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW!"

282
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,701
I KIND OF SCARED MYSELF.

283
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:46,706
WELL, AT LEAST YOU SCARED SOMEONE.

284
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,207
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

285
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,709
YOU'D THINK I'D BE ANGRY.

286
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,212
I MEAN, YOU'D THINK I'D WANT TO RIP HIS TINY LITTLE HEAD OFF.

287
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,215
FORTUNATELY, I'M PAST IT.

288
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,718
PHOEBE, YOU DO SEE M A LITTLE TENSE.

289
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,719
HERE. LET ME HELP YOU.

290
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:00,720
ALL RIGHT.

291
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,221
GET OFF!

292
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,223
OW! OH, STOP IT!

293
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,225
WHY? WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT TO ME?!

294
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,227
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

295
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,730
AS A MASSEUSE AND A HUMAN

296
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,734
I'M BEGGING YOU, NEVER DO THAT TO ANYONE.

297
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,737
I GIVE GOOD MASSAGES.

298
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,738

299
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,240
I USED TO GIVE THEM TO RACHEL ALL THE TIME

300
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,742
BEFORE SHE GOT ALLERGIC.

301
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,245
AND CHANDLER...

302
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,747
HE LOVES THEM. WATCH.

303
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,250
HE DOES NOT LIKE IT.

304
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,251
HE HATES IT. HE'S IN PAIN.

305
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,753
NO, HE'S NOT.

306
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,254
YES, HE IS.

307
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,255
WHAT?

308
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,258
I'M SORRY, BUT... OW! OW! OW!

309
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,264
HAVE YOU BEEN LYING TO ME?

310
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,266
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D DO THAT.

311
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,268
WELL, MAYBE HE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

312
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,271
BUT THE MINUTE WE START TO LIE TO EACH OTHER...

313
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,276
AND BY "WE"

314
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,779
I MEAN SOCIETY...

315
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,784
ANY TIME YOU'RE READY, JOEY.

316
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,786
"WELL, YOU MUST BE NEW HERE.

317
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,788
MAYBE WE GET A TABLE AND I BUY YOU A DRINK."

318
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,289
I'M SORRY.

319
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,792
COULD YOU... COULD YOU TRY IT WITHOUT THE PURSE?

320
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,795
YEAH. SURE.

321
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,301
"WELL, YOU MUS T BE NEW HERE.

322
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,803
"MAYBE WE SIT...

323
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,805
I'M SORRY. CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

324
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,306
SURE. WHAT?

325
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,809
WELL, FIRST, IT'S NOT A PURSE.

326
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,812
OKAY. ANY TIME.

327
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,815
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE THINKING IT'S A WOMAN'S BAG, IT'S NOT.

328
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,817
IT'S A MAN'S BAG.

329
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,821
OKAY, AND GO.

330
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,824
LET ME SHOW YOU THE CATALOG.

331
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,826
LOOK. SEE? HUH?

332
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,327
IT'S THE LATEST THING.

333
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,329
EVERYONE'S GOT ONE:

334
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,330
MEN, WOMEN , CHILDREN.

335
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,832
EVERYONE'S CARRYING THEM.

336
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,333
DO YOU SELL THESE BAGS?

337
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,837
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

338
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,339
THESE BABIES SELL THEMSELVES.

339
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,841
OKAY. THANK YOU.

340
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,842
THAT WAS GREAT.

341
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,844
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T EVEN READ ANYTHING.

342
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,346
I THINK WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH.

343
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,349
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU.

344
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,352
WE GOT IT, WE GOT IT.

345
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,355
HEY. IS RACHEL HERE?

346
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,356
NO.

347
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,859
LISTEN, I JUST WANTED TO APOLOGIZE

348
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,860
ABOUT THIS AFTERNOON

349
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,362
AND THE WHOLE MASSAGE THING, YOU KNOW?

350
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,364
I I REALLY LIKE THEM.

351
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,867
OH, PLEASE, STOP.

352
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,368
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HONEST

353
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,870
WITH EACH OTHER.

354
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,371
I JUST WISH YOU COULD TELL ME.

355
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,374
JUST SAY IT: "I DON'T LIKE YOUR MASSAGES."

356
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:43,382
I DON'T LIKE YOUR MASSAGES.

357
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,886
SEE? IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

358
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,887
OKAY, BUT NOW, SEE?

359
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,388
YOU'RE CRYING.

360
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,890
I'M NOT CRYING ABOUT THAT.

361
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,391
I'M CRYING ABOUT SOMETHING.

362
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,392
THAT HAPPENED AT WORK.

363
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,894
WHAT?

364
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,396
MY BOYFRIEND SAID HE DIDN'T LIKE MY MASSAGES!

365
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,398
IT'S OKAY.

366
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,901
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE THE BEST AT EVERYTHING.

367
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,903
OH, MY GOD!

368
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,405
YOU DON'T KNOW ME AT ALL!

369
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:11,410
OKAY. YOU GIVE THE WORST MASSAGES IN THE WORLD.

370
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,913
I'M CRYING HERE!

371
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,914
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

372
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,415
HEAR ME OUT, OKAY?

373
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,417
YOU GIVE THE BEST BAD MASSAGES, OKAY?

374
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,921
IF ANYBODY WAS LOOKING FOR THE BEST BAD MASSAGE

375
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,923
AND THEY WERE THINKING TO THEMSELVES

376
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,925
"WHO'S THE BEST AT THAT?"

377
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,426
THEY'D HAVE TO GO TO YOU

378
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,432
HUH.

379
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,935
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT, LIKE, UM...

380
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,438
IF THERE WAS AN AWARD FOR THE BEST BAD MASSAGE...

381
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,941
WELL, WHO WOULD GET THAT?

382
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,942
OH, IT WOULD BE YOU.

383
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,443
YOU, MONICA

384
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,946
AND YOU'D GET ALL THE VOTES.

385
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,449
SO MAYBE THEY COULD, UM, CALL THE AWARD "THE MONICA"?

386
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,953
ABSOLUTELY.

387
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,956
OKAY.

388
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,957
I SUCK.

389
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:58,958
YEAH.

390
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,466
THANK YOU FOR MEETING WITH ME.

391
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,968
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT

392
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,471
COME SIT.

393
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,974
SIT.

394
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,977
SIT!

395
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,978
UM, ALL RIGHTY.

396
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,480
UM, BEFORE WE GET STARTED, I'D JUST...

397
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,481
I NEED YOU TO STATE

398
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,983
FOR THE, YOU KNOW, OFFICIAL RECORD

399
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,985
THAT YOU ARE, IN FACT, FRANK BUFFAY.

400
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,987
OH, YES. YES, YES, I AM. MM HMM.

401
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,488
OKAY.

402
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,489
SO...

403
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,491
WHAT DID FRANCES LEAVE ME?

404
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,993
HUH?

405
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,494
THAT'S WHY YOU WANTED ME TO COME, RIGHT?

406
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:36,996
OH, YES.

407
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,498
YES. YEAH. NO, SHE DID.

408
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,000
SHE LEFT YOU, UM...

409
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,502
THIS LIPSTICK.

410
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,505
OH... HUH.

411
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,507
THAT'S...

412
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:52,011
OH, IT'S USED.

413
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,514
UH, COOL.

414
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:59,018
OKAY. I HAVE JUST A FEW QUESTIONS TO ASK

415
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,521
SO I'M GOING TO GET OUT MY OFFICIAL FORMS.

416
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,526
OKAY. SO, QUESTION ONE:

417
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,030
YOU WERE MARRIED TO FRANCES'S DAUGHTER, LILY.

418
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,531
IS THAT CORRECT?

419
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,533
YES. YES, I WAS.

420
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,036
OKAY. UM, QUESTION TWO:

421
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:22,041
UM, "DID THAT MARRIAGE END, A HAPPILY, B MEDIUM

422
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:28,047
OR C IN THE TOTAL ABANDONMENT OF HER AND HER TWO CHILDREN?"

423
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,049
IT REALLY SAYS THAT?

424
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,551
YEAH. SEE?

425
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:36,055
WELL, I GUESS THAT I WOULD HAVE TO SAY "C."

426
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,056
HMM. OKAY.

427
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,058
TOTAL ABANDONMENT, MM HMM.

428
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,561
OKAY. "REASONS FOR ABANDONMENT."

429
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:48,067
UM, "A TOP SECRET GOVERNMENT WORK, B AMNESIA

430
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:54,073
OR CYOU'RE JUST A SELFISH, IRRESPONSIBLE, BAD, BAD MAN?"

431
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,076
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK I WANT THE LIPSTICK THAT MUCH

432
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,079
BUT, UH... OH, WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR

433
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,083
AND, UM, WOULD YOU GIVE LILY

434
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,085
THAT, PLEASE?

435
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,086
WHAT?

436
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,087
LILY. WHEN YOU SEE LILY

437
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,588
WOULD YOU GIVE HER THAT NOTE

438
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,091
BECAUSE I WANTED TO TALK TO HER AT THE MEMORIAL.

439
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:16,095
WELL, I PICTURED HER GETTING MAD AT ME THE WAY YOU GOT MAD AT ME

440
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,597
AND I CHICKENED OUT, SO I WROTE HER THAT NOTE.

441
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,599
WOULD YOU GIVE IT TO HER, PLEASE?

442
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,102
YOU YOU YOU CAME TO SEE LILY?

443
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,604
YEAH, YEAH. WHY?

444
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,606
LILY'S DEAD.

445
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:31,110
SHE WHAT?

446
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,611
SHE'S DEAD.

447
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,113
ARE YOU SURE?

448
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,114
WELL, IF SHE ISN'T

449
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,616
CREMATING HER WAS BIG MISTAKE.

450
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,119
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

451
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,121
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

452
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,623
HOW, HOW...? OH, MY GOD.

453
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,625
HOW HOW LONG AGO?

454
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,127
17 YEARS AGO.

455
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,129
OH...

456
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,132
WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE GIRLS?

457
00:18:55,634 --> 00:19:01,140
WELL, URSULA IS A WAITRESS AND SHE LIVES IN SOHO

458
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,143
AND PHOEBE...

459
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,646
IS ON THIS COUCH.

460
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,655
YEP. LIPSTICK AND A DAUGHTER.

461
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,657
BIG DAY FOR YOU, HUH?

462
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,660
PHOEBE, I I I, UM...

463
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,163
WHOOPS.

464
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,665
IT'S JUST... I I I DON'T KNOW

465
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,667
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

466
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,169
I JUST

467
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,672
CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER.

468
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,174
YOU'RE SO PRETTY.

469
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:39,178
YES. WELL, THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE.

470
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,182
SO, WOULD IT WOULD  IT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER

471
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:47,686
IF I SAID THAT I WAS VERY, VERY SORRY I LEFT?

472
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,687
YOU KNOW WHAT?

473
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,689
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU SAY.

474
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,692
IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE ANYWAY

475
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,693
SO YOU CAN JUST GO.

476
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:59,198
ALL RIGHT. WELL, YOU KNOW, IN MY DEFENSE

477
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,700
I WAS A LOUSY FATHER.

478
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,702
THAT'S YOUR DEFENSE?

479
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,703
YES, IT IS.

480
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,704
I BURNED THE FORMULA

481
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,207
AND I PUT YOUR DIAPERS ON BACKWARDS.

482
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,210
I MEAN, I MADE UP A SONG TO SING YOU TO SLEEP

483
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,712
BUT THAT MADE  YOU CRY EVEN MORE.

484
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,214
YOU MAKE UP SONGS?

485
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,215
WELL, NO.

486
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,716
JUST THAT ONE.

487
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,218
IT WAS STUPID.

488
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,219
LET'S SEE.

489
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,720
HOW DID IT GO?

490
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,722
UM... YEAH. OKAY.

491
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,225
?? SLEEPY GIRL, SLEEPY GIRL ??

492
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,728
?? WHY WON'T YOU GO TO SLEEP? ??

493
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,232
?? SLEEPY GIRL, SLEEPY GIRL ??

494
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,734
?? YOU'RE YOU'RE- YOU'RE KEEPING ME UP.??

495
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,236
WELL, YEAH.

496
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,752
I JUST...

497
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:58,757
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT VE RY GOOD AT THIS SO, UM...

498
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,259
WELL, I AM.

499
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,766
NOT YET. NO.

500
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,771
HEY.

501
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,773
HEY, MAN, HOW'D THE AUDITION GO?

502
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,775
ESTELLE SAID I DIDN'T GET IT.

503
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,776
WHAT? WHY?

504
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,279
JOEY, YOU WERE SO READY FOR IT.

505
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,780
YEAH. I THOUGHT SO, TOO

506
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,783
BUT SHE SAID THE CASTING PEOPLE HAD SOME PROBLEMS WITH ME.

507
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,285
WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS?

508
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,287
WELL, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, THEY, UH...

509
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,289
THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE BAG.

510
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,790
OH, MY GOD.

511
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,791
NO...

512
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,792
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

513
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,794
IT WAS A STUPID PLAY, ANYWAY.

514
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,297
JOEY, I THINK IT'S TIME TO GIVE UP THE BAG.

515
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,300
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP THE BAG.

516
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,303
I DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP THE BAG, DO I, RACH?

517
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,808
YOU THINK I SHOULD GIVE UP THE BAG.

518
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,310
WAIT, JOEY. I'M SORRY.

519
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,312
AS TERRIFIC AS I THINK YOU ARE WITH IT...

520
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,813
OH, HEY.

521
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,816
I JUST DON'T KNOW

522
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,320
IF THE WORLD IS READY FOR YOU AND YOUR BAG.

523
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,824
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M HEARING THIS.

524
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,826
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

525
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,329
I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A BAG.

526
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,832
I JUST... IT'S JUST THAT THERE ARE OTHER BAGS, YOU KNOW

527
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,835
THAT ARE MAYBE A LITTLE LESS, UM... CONTROVERSIAL.

528
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,838
YEAH. UM, THEY'RE CALLED WALLETS.

529
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,843
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.

530
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,846
IT'S JUST THIS BAG HAS BECOME, LIKE, A PART OF ME, YOU KNOW?

531
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,848
IT'S, LIKE, MY BAG.

532
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,851
IT HAD A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING.

533
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,853
IT'S...

534
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,355
OH, MAN!

535
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,356
WHAT?

536
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,857
THERE'S A WHOLE

537
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,859
SERIES OF POCKETS HERE

538
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,861
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT, RACH!

539
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,363
OH. SORRY.

540
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,368
URSULA, I HAVE THE MOST AMAZING NEWS.

541
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,370
I FOUND OUR DAD.

542
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,871
PHOEBE.

543
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,376
YOUR SISTER.

544
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,878
AND I FOUND OUR DAD!

545
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,380
JOHN GLENN?

546
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,382
JOHN GLENN IS NOT OUR DAD.

547
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:07,386
NO, I WILL NOT JOIN YOU IN THE LAWSUIT AGAINST HIM.

548
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,388
BUT IT... IT DOESN'T MATTER

549
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,391
THAT HE WASN'T THERE WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP.

550
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,892
HE'S NOT OUR FATHER!

551
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,895
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THAT'S FOR A JURY TO DECIDE?
