1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,502

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,005
ARE YOU LOOKING  AT NAKED TRIBES WOMEN?

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,507
NO. LOOK.

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,010
THAT'S A PIG.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,013
I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT LOOK AT THE KNOBS ON IT.

6
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,517
HEY.

7
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,019
HEY. HEY.

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,520
EMILY'S COUSIN KICKED ME OUT.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,022
WHAT? WHY?

10
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,024
WELL, WHEN YOU'RE SUBLETTING AN APARTMENT

11
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,526
FROM YOUR WIFE'S COUSIN, AND THEN YOU GET A DIVORCE

12
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,529
SOMETIMES THE COUSIN SUDDENLY WANTS HIS APARTMENT BACK.

13
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,031
HOW CAN HE DO THAT? DIDN'T YOU SIGN A LEASE?

14
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,034
WHO NEEDS A LEASE WHEN IT'S FAMILY?

15
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,036
HEY, YOU COULD STAY WITH US.

16
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,538
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

17
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,040
ANYTHING YOU NEED, MAN

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,041
BUT YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME

19
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,042
YOU WILL LET US KNOW

20
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,044
THE SECOND YOU ARE FEELING BETTER

21
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,045
SO WE CAN MAKE FUN

22
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,546
OF YOUR HAIR.

23
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,048
YOU GOT IT.

24
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,049
OKAY.

25
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,551
THANKS, YOU GUYS, I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS.

26
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,553
I'M GOING TO GET PACKING AGAIN.

27
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,555
I'VE BEEN MOVING AROUND SO MUCH LATELY

28
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,557
I'M BEGINNING TO FEEL LIKE A NOMAD.

29
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,060

30
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,061
WHAT?

31
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,563
HE THOUGHT YOU SAID "GONAD."

45
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,615
WOW, MONICA. IF EVERY RESTAURANT WERE AS CLEAN AS YOURS

46
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,617
IT'D BE A TOUGH TIME MAKING A LIVING.

47
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,619
OH, LARRY.

48
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,121
SO, UM, DO HEALTH INSPECTORS

49
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,622
WORK ON COMMISSION?

50
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,124
NO. BRIBES.

51
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,126
IT'S OKAY TO LAUGH, RIGHT?

52
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,627
YEAH. I WAS JUST KIDDING.

53
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,628
OKAY.

54
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,130
I'M GOING TO CHECK THE KITCHEN FLOOR.

55
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,631
OKAY. KNOCK YOURSELF OUT, LARRY.

56
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,133
I DON'T GET VIOLATIONS.

57
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,635
YOU COULD EAT BEANS OFF THAT FLOOR.

58
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,138
BUT DON'T, BECAUSE THAT'D BE A VIOLATION.

59
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,142
YUMMY.

60
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,644
WHAT? LARRY?

61
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,645
OH, YEAH. I'D LET  HIM

62
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,647
CHECK OUT MY KITCHEN FLOOR.

63
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,652
A 98.

64
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,154
I DEDUCTED TWO POINTS BECAUSE

65
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,156
YOU'RE NOT WEARING YOUR CHEF'S HAT

66
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,158
AND THAT IS A SECTION FIVE VIOLATION.

67
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,659
LOOK, LARRY, HONEY

68
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,661
UM... I WROTE THE BOOK ON SECTION FIVE

69
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,664
AND I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WEAR YOUR HAT

70
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,166
UNLESS YOU'RE IN THE KITCHEN.

71
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,167
WHERE IS YOUR HAT?

72
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,169
IT'S IN THE KITCHEN. I'LL GO GET IT.

73
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,172
THERE'S THE TWO POINTS.

74
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,676
HEY, YOU SHOULD REALLY READ THAT BOOK YOU WROTE.

75
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,683
WOW.

76
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,185
YOU SAW THE HAT IN THE KITCHEN

77
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,187
AND YOU KNEW SHE'D HAVE TO GO

78
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,688
IN THERE HATLESS TO GET IT.

79
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,690
YOU COULD HAVE YOUR OWN, YOU KNOW

80
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,692
HEALTH INSPECTOR DETECTIVE SHOW.

81
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,195
WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

82
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,698
YEAH, BUT THEN I COULD BE YOUR SIDEKICK, VUNDA.

83
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,700
MAYBE VUNDA COULD GIVE ME HER NUMBER

84
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,202
AND I COULD ASK HER TO DINNER SOMETIME.

85
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,704
OKAY, SHE WOULD LOVE THAT, YOU KNOW

86
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,708
SINCE YOU KNOW ALL THE CLEAN PLACES TO EAT.

87
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,210
I'LL CALL YOU.

88
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,711
OKAY.

89
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,718
HE'S SO FUNNY. WHOA. OH.

90
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,226
THANKS.

91
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,227
THANK YOU.

92
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,228
MON, HOW'S ROSS DOING

93
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,231
YOU KNOW, SINCE ALL THE EMILY STUFF?

94
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,732
HE'S NOT GREAT , BUT, UM...

95
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,733
HE'S DEALING WITH IT.

96
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,735
OH, WAIT A MINUTE, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO...?

97
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,237
OH, HONEY, PLEASE, NO.

98
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,739
I CAN'T GET STARTED WITH ALL THAT ROSS STUFF AGAIN.

99
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,242
HE'S GOING TO BE SCREWED UP FOR A LONG TIME.

100
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,243
AND BESIDES, YOU KNOW

101
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,246
I DON'T GO FOR GUYS RIGHT AFTER THEY GET DIVORCED.

102
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,747
RIGHT. YOU ONLY GO FOR THEM

103
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,749
FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THEY GET MARRIED.

104
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,756
TWO POUNDS OF MOCHA JAVA, PLEASE.

105
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,757
IT'S DANNY.

106
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,259
ARE YOU GUYS EVER GOING OUT AGAIN?

107
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,760
I DON'T KNOW. HE HASN'T CALLED ME

108
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,762
SINCE THAT ONE TIME WE WENT OUT.

109
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,764
I SEE HIM IN THE HALLWAY, WE FLIRT.

110
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,766
I'M ALL...

111
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,768
... AND NOTHING.

112
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,769
HEY.

113
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,770
HI, DANNY.

114
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,272
WOW. THIRSTY, HUH?

115
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,774
ACTUALLY, I'M HAVING A PARTY AT MY PLACE ON SATURDAY--

116
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,775
SORT OF A HOUSEWARMING THING.

117
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,777
OH, FUN. OH, GREAT.

118
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,779
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

119
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,780
OKAY, SEE YOU.

120
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,288
WELL, I GUESS WE WON'T BE WARMING HIS HOUSE.

121
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,791
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

122
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,793
I SEE WHAT HE'S DOING.

123
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,295
HE'S NOT ASKING ME OUT

124
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,298
BECAUSE HE WANTS ME TO ASK HIM OUT.

125
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,299
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT.

126
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,800
THAT'S RIGHT.

127
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,303
BECAUSE THAT WOULD GIVE HIM THE CONTROL.

128
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,805
SO NOW HE'S ALL, OOH, COMING UP WITH THIS

129
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,307
"I'VE GOT A PARTY" THING--

130
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,808
YOU KNOW, TRYING TO GET ME

131
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,810
TO HINT AROUND FOR AN INVITATION.

132
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,812
BLEW UP IN HIS FACE, DIDN'T IT?

133
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,814
SO THERE IS NO PARTY?

134
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,816
OH, NO.

135
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,318
THERE'S A PARTY.

136
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,821
THERE'S A PARTY, BUT THE POWER--

137
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,324
THAT IS STILL UP FOR GRABS.

138
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,326
YOU FOLLOW ME?

139
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,327
I THINK SO.

140
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,330
SO HE'S NOT INVITING YOU TO HIS PARTY

141
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,831
BECAUSE HE LIKES YOU.

142
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,333
EXACTLY.

143
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,837
THEN WHY DIDN'T HE INVITE ME?

144
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,343
OH! TO THROW ME OFF.

145
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,354
ROSS?

146
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,855
HEY, ROOMIES.

147
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,357
HEY.

148
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,859
LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THE PLACE.

149
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,862
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW, IT'S A LOT OF BOXES

150
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,865
BUT AGAIN, I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU GUYS LETTING ME STAY HERE.

151
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,367
NOT A PROBLEM.

152
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,869
AND LISTEN, HEY-- SINCE YOU'RE GOING TO BE HERE FOR A WHILE

153
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,372
I WAS THINKING WE'D PUT YOUR NAME ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE.

154
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,874
OH. I, UH, HOPE YOU DON'T MIND

155
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,878
BUT I KIND OF ALREADY JAZZED IT UP A LITTLE.

156
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,380
CHECK IT OUT.

157
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,884

158
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:30,390
 ?? We will, we will call you back. ??

159
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,391
HEY.

160
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,392
ALL RIGHT.

161
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,394
PRETTY COOL, HUH?

162
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,398
YOU'RE FAKE LAUGHING, TOO, RIGHT?

163
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,400
OH, THE TEARS ARE REAL.

164
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,406
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL THIS EVENING.

165
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,908
SHOW ME THE BADGE AGAIN.

166
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,416
SHINY.

167
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,417
YOU MIND IF I WASH UP?

168
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,918
I CAME STRAIGHT FROM WORK

169
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,920
AND WHO KNOWS WHERE THESE BABIES HAVE BEEN?

170
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,922
YOU ARE JUST NONSTOP.

171
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,434
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

172
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,435
WHY?

173
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:16,936
JUST WALKING PAST THE KITCHEN

174
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,438
I SAW TEN VIOLATIONS.

175
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,939
I AM SHUTTING THIS PLACE DOWN.

176
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,441
YOU HAVE THE POWER TO DO THAT?

177
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,443
THIS DOES.

178
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,446
SHUT IT DOWN.

179
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,459
HEY.

180
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,961
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

181
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,963
NOTHING.

182
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,467
YOU BUILT A FORT, DIDN'T YOU?

183
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,471
KIND OF.

184
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,973
OH, MY GOD, THE AIR PURIFIER.

185
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,475
ROSS'S AIR PURIFIER.

186
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,478
ALL I HEARD FOR FOUR YEARS THROUGH COLLEGE WAS...

187
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,979

188
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,982
DUDE, YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE OUT ONCE IN A WHILE.

189
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,484
I HATE THIS THING.

190
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,985
COME ON, CHANDLER.

191
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,487
ROSS IS OUR FRIEND.

192
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,488
HE NEEDS US RIGHT NOW.

193
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,490
SO, WHY DON'T YOU BE A GROWNUP

194
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,492
AND COME WATCH SOME TV IN THE FORT?

195
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,999
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT LARRY CLOSED DOWN CHERMIN'S.

196
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,000
I LOVE THAT PLACE.

197
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,502
YEAH, I KNOW

198
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,504
BUT YOU SHOULD'VE HEARD ABOUT ALL THEIR VIOLATIONS.

199
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,506
LARRY SAID THAT THEY SHOULD CALL IT VERMIN'S.

200
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,007

201
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,009
THAT GUY JUST PLAIN KILLS ME.

202
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,512

203
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,016
OH, HI, DANNY.

204
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,518
HEY, GUYS, UH, I JUST WANTED TO INVITE YOU

205
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,019
TO THE PARTY TOMORROW NIGHT.

206
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,521
OH, THANKS.

207
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,022
I'LL TRY TO STOP BY.

208
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,525
YEAH, ACTUALLY, I THINK... I'M GOING TO BE BUSY.

209
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,026
YOU ARE?

210
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,528
YEAH. REMEMBER?

211
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,531
I'VE GOT THAT, UH... GALA.

212
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,534
WHAT'S THE GALA FOR?

213
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,536
UH, IT'S A, UM...

214
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,038
IT'S A, IT'S  A REGATTA GALA.

215
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,040
REALLY? YOU SAIL?

216
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,043
NO. NO, BUT I SUPPORT IT.

217
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,046
OKAY. WELL, HOPE I SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT.

218
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,047
OKAY.

219
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,048
TAKE CARE.

220
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,049
OKAY.

221
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,555
WALKED RIGHT INTO THAT ONE, DIDN'T HE?

222
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,556
WHAT ONE?

223
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,057
YOU WANTED HIM TO INVITE YOU.

224
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,559
TO THE PARTY AND HE DID.

225
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,561
YEAH, BUT HE WAITED UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE.

226
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,062
SO IF I SAID YES, HE WOULD KNOW

227
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,064
THAT I HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO THAN WAIT AROUND

228
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,066
FOR AN INVITATION TO HIS STUPID PARTY.

229
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,568
I SAID NO, WHICH PUTS ME

230
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,572
RIGHT BACK IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT.

231
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,073
SO, THE BALL IS  IN HIS COURT?

232
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,575
BALL?

233
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,577
NO, THERE'S NO BALL.

234
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,080
HEY, PHEEBS, YOU WANT TO JOIN US?

235
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,082
OH, SURE, YEAH. WHERE'S THIS FROM?

236
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,584
IT'S FROM SUN LING'S.

237
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,085
OOH!

238
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,589
LARRY JUST TOLD ME SOMETHING ABOUT SUN LING...

239
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,090
OH, NO, THANK YOU.

240
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,596

241
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,103
JOEY, PLEASE.

242
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,605
SORRY.

243
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,611

244
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,116

245
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,623
HELLO, CHILDREN.

246
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,624
HEY.

247
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,125
WANT TO PLAY SOME FOOSBALL?

248
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,127
PLEASE?

249
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,629
OKAY.

250
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,630
NO, NO. NO.

251
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,132
WE HAD TO MOVE THE TABLE INTO MY ROOM

252
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,134
BECAUSE OF ALL THE BOXES.

253
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,636
COME ON.

254
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,143
ALL RIGHT, I HAVE ONE QUESTION.

255
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,647
WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH THIS?

256
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,150
BYE BYE, LITTLE PUPPET JOEY HAND?

257
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,152
NO, NO, THE "QUIET DOWN" THING.

258
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,655
OH, YOU MEAN THIS.

259
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,157
MM! MM!

260
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,661
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MORE OF THIS I CAN TAKE.

261
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,163
DID YOU KNOW HE TAPED OVER MY BAYWATCH TAPE

262
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,665
WITH SOME SHOW ABOUT BUGS?

263
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,668
MY GOD.

264
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,670
WHAT IF THAT HAD BEEN PORN, HUH?

265
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,171
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, YOU KNOW

266
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,174
THIS MAY BE TOUGH, BUT COME ON, IT'S ROSS.

267
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,176
I SURVIVED COLLEGE WITH HIM.

268
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,680
ALL RIGHT. I GUESS I CAN HOLD OUT A LITTLE LONGER.

269
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,681
LET'S HAVE A GAME.

270
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,682
OKAY.

271
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,685
NO, NO, NO.

272
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,186
YES!

273
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,688

274
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,189
UH, FELLAS?

275
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,696

276
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,698
OKAY, SO HE'S OUT OF HERE.

277
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,205
HEY. HEY.

278
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,707
YOU GUYS GOT ANYTHING TO EAT?

279
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,208
I JUST WENT DOWN TO JOHN O's

280
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,210
FOR SOME CHICKEN, AND IT WAS CLOSED.

281
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,714
I TOOK LARRY THERE TO EAT, BUT IT WAS ALL VIOLATED

282
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,215
SO WE SHUT IT DOWN.

283
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,217
PHEEBS, IF THIS GUY KEEPS CLOSING DOWN

284
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,220
ALL OUR FAVORITE PLACES, WHERE WE GOING TO EAT?

285
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,222
I DON'T KNOW; CLEAN PLACES?

286
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,724
MMM. YUM.

287
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,726

288
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,230
IT'S DANNY.

289
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,733
DON'T LET HIM IN. I'M SUPPOSED TO BE AT A REGATTA GALA.

290
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,234
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

291
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,737
CAN'T YOU JUST SAY IT STARTS LATER?

292
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,240
WHAT KIND OF A REGATTA GALA STARTS AT NIGHT?

293
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,242
THE FAKE KIND.

294
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,747
HEY, UM, I NEED A LADLE.

295
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,749
YOU GOT A LADLE?

296
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,250
WE HAVE A LADLE.

297
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,253
THANKS. SEE YOU AT THE PARTY.

298
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,755
OKAY. GREAT.

299
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,757
HEY, YOU GUYS.

300
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,759
YOU KNOW WHAT LARRY WOULD SAY?

301
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,260
HE'D SAY, "SEE YOU LADLE."

302
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,263

303
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,765
WELL, I'M DONE WITH THIS.

304
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,266
YOU WANT ANYTHING, ROSS?

305
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,268
UH, SPORTS? INTERNATIONAL?

306
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,269

307
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,271
UH, I'LL TAKE SPORTS.

308
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,273
MINE.

309
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,274
ALL RIGHT.

310
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,776
UH, INTERNATIONAL.

311
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,277
THAT'S MINE, TOO.

312
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,781
I'M ITALIAN.

313
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,284
I GUESS I COULD CHECK OUT THOSE APARTMENT LISTINGS

314
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,787
EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NEVER ANYTHING IN HERE.

315
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,789
NOT EVEN ON PAGE SEVEN?

316
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,793
OH, YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT.

317
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,795
OH, HERE'S AN AFFORDABLE PLACE.

318
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,297
TWO BEDROOM, CLOSE TO WORK.

319
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,800
OOH, IT'S AVAILABLE IN FIVE WEEKS.

320
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,802
WHAT ABOUT THAT CIRCLED ONE?

321
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,303
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

322
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,306
IT'S KIND OF EXPENSIVE FOR A STUDIO.

323
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,808
BUT IT'S AVAILABLE NOW...

324
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,810
ISN'T IT?

325
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,311
YES, IT IS.

326
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,314
LET'S GO LOOK AT IT.

327
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,816
OKAY, LET'S GO.

328
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,317
HERE WE GO. HEY, HEY.

329
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,318
OH, OH, OH , HEY, GUYS.

330
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,821
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULD, UH...

331
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,323
MAYBE CHIP IN FOR SOME NEW AIR FILTERS

332
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,324
FOR THE PURIFIER?

333
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,327
I MEAN, AFTER ALL, WE ARE ALL USING IT.

334
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,829
LET'S GO QUICKER.

335
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,340

336
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,343
OH, MY GOD.

337
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,344
MMM.

338
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,846
LOOK AT THIS KITCHEN...

339
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,347
SLASH BATHROOM.

340
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,849
THAT'S GREAT, YOU KNOW

341
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,852
SO YOU CAN COOK WHILE IN THE TUB.

342
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,855
SOMEBODY WAS USING HIS HEAD.

343
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,358
HEY, LET'S CHECK OUT THE REST OF THE PLACE.

344
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,870
I THINK THIS IS IT.

345
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,371
I DON'T KNOW.

346
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,373
MAYBE WE SHOULD KEEP LOOKING.

347
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,877
BUT, HEY, ROSS, THIS PLACE IS AVAILABLE NOW.

348
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,879
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE STUCK WITH US

349
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,380
FOR THE NEXT FIVE WEEKS.

350
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,381
YEAH.

351
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,888
SO YOU THINK I SHOULD GO AHEAD

352
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,389
AND TAKE THIS PLACE?

353
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,391
IT'S PERFECT.

354
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,896
HOW ABOUT YOU?

355
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,399
KITCHEN SLASH BATHROOM.

356
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,404
UH, I SEE WHAT YOU GUYS ARE SAYING.

357
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,406
I'LL, UH... I'LL GO DOWNSTAIRS

358
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,408
FILL OUT AN APPLICATION.

359
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,915
WE ARE BAD PEOPLE.

360
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,417
HE KNEW WE WERE TRYING TO GET RID OF HIM.

361
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,419
HE KNEW.

362
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,423
YOU THINK WE COULD GET A BATHTUB IN OUR KITCHEN?

363
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,930
HEY, YOU READY FOR DINNER?

364
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,931
OOH, ABSOLUTELY.

365
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,432
GREAT.

366
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,433
YOU WANT TO GO  TO THE ITALIAN PLACE

367
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,434
DOWN ON BLEECKER STREET, RIGHT?

368
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,436
OOH, I LOVE THAT PLACE.

369
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,939
SO... NO.

370
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,440
OH, HOW ABOUT MAMA LEZOTTI'S?

371
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,942
UGH.

372
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,944
SURE.

373
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,947
I WONDER HOW LONG THAT MILK HAS BEEN SITTING OUT.

374
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,948
OH, NO. THIS PLACE

375
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,449
IS TOTALLY HEALTHY.

376
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,951
THIS MILK IS MINE.

377
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:56,455
I BOUGHT THIS TODAY BECAUSE I WAS THIRSTY FOR MILK, YOU KNOW.

378
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,461
OKAY, LET'S GO.

379
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,966
HEY, BUDDY.

380
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,467
YOU FAMILIAR WITH SECTION 11 B

381
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,468
OF THE HEALTH CODE

382
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,470
THAT REQUIRES ALL REFUSE MATERIAL

383
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,972
TO BE TAKEN OUT OF THE BACK EXIT?

384
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,973
BUT THEN I HAVE TO GO

385
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,474
ALL THE WAY AROUND THE DRY CLEANER.

386
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,977
OH, SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU CHOOSE CONVENIENCE OVER HEALTH?

387
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:23,983
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN A... FREE COFFEE?

388
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,984
OKAY, STOP

389
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:29,488
LARRY... OKAY, CAN'T YOU JUST BE LARRY

390
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,991
AND NOT LARRY THE HEALTH INSPECTOR GUY?

391
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,994
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, IT WAS REALLY EXCITING

392
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,496
AT FIRST, BUT NOW, IT'S LIKE, OKAY-

393
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,498
SO WHERE ARE WE GOING TO EAT EVER?

394
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,500
WELL, I SUPPOSE I COULD

395
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,002
GIVE HIM A WARNING.

396
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,503
THANK YOU.

397
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,505
OKAY,  GO, GO, GO.

398
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,510
NOW, IF, AFTER DINNER

399
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,013
YOU STILL, LIKE, REALLY NEED TO BUST SOMEONE

400
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,515
I KNOW A HOT DOG VENDOR WHO PICKS HIS NOSE.

401
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,022
MAYBE... MAYBE  WE DID A GOOD THING

402
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,524
HELPING ROSS GET BACK ON HIS FEET.

403
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,526
YES, THAT WAS A NICE PLACE. YEAH.

404
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,527
NOT A LOT OF CLOSET SPACE

405
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,529
BUT HE COULD JUST HANG HIS STUFF

406
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,530
OUT THE WINDOW IN A BAG.

407
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,032
YEAH!

408
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,037
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

409
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,039
I DON'T KNOW.

410
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,041
MAYBE PIZZA?

411
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,043
ABOUT ROSS.

412
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,544
OH.

413
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,047

414
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,550
HELLO?

415
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,053
OH, YEAH.

416
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,055
IT'S THE APARTMENT MANAGER.

417
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,057
ROSS PUT US DOWN AS REFERENCES.

418
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,559
ROSS IS THE GREATEST GUY YOU'LL EVER MEET.

419
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,061
YEAH, HE'S VERY RELIABLE.

420
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,063
OF COURSE, HE  HAS A BIG, HUGE DOG

421
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,065
THAT, UH, BARKS INTO THE NIGHT.

422
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,069
WELL, WHO DOESN'T LOVE DOGS?

423
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,072
UH, HE'S A TAP DANCER.

424
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,076
YES, SOME WOULD SAY THAT IS A LOST ART.

425
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,078
HE'S A PIMP.

426
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,582
THERE YOU GO. YES, HE'S A PIMP.

427
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,584
HE'S A BIG, TAP DANCING PIMP.

428
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,087
HELLO?

429
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,100
OH.

430
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,106
OKAY, HONEY, I'M READY.

431
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,607
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

432
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,109
I AM GOING TO WANDER INTO THE PARTY

433
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,112
AND I WILL BE ALL, YOU KNOW, "OOH, I DON'T NEED THIS.

434
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,613
I'M COMING FROM A REGATTA GALA."

435
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,120
DID YOU PICK THIS OUT OF A BOOK?

436
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,623
MONICA, HONEY, THIS IS AS REAL AS IT GETS.

437
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:48,127

438
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,130
?? WATCHIN' ??

439
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,632
?? FOR A SOUND TO LEAD ME TO ??

440
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,134
?? WHEREVER YOU GO WALKIN'...??

441
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,136
THIS IS NEVER GOING TO WORK.

442
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,137
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,137
HE'S RIGHT THERE.

443
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,139
JUST GO OVER AND SAY HI.

444
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,641
I HAVE TO GO DOWNSTAIRS, COME BACK UP

445
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,144
AS IF I'M COMING HOME FROM THE REGATTA GALA.

446
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,146
OKAY? SO JUST GO DISTRACT HIM.

447
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,147
BUT DON'T BE SEXY.

448
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,151
HEY, DANNY.

449
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,153
WHAT'S GOING ON?

450
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,654
IT'S A GREAT PARTY.

451
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,156
GREAT FOOD.

452
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,157
UH HUH.

453
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,159
YOU KNOW, MOST PARTIES

454
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,163
IT'S ALL CHIPS AND SALSA, CHIPS AND SALSA.

455
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,665
SO, UH...

456
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,167
WHAT'S THIS?

457
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,169
SALAD.

458
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,670
OH.

459
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,173
AND, UH, WHAT'S THIS?

460
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,675
BREAD.

461
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,178
AREN'T YOU A CHEF?

462
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,181
OH.

463
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,182
HEY, RACHEL.

464
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,684
HEY. OH, RIGHT.

465
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,686
TONIGHT WAS YOUR PARTY.

466
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,688
YOU LOOK GREAT. I'M GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT.

467
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,692
OH, YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, THE GALA HAD TO END SOMETIME.

468
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,693
DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

469
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,195
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, ALL RIGHT?

470
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,696
YEAH, SURE.

471
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,201
ALL RIGHT, WHOSE COURT'S THE BALL IN NOW?

472
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,203
I THOUGHT THERE WASN'T A BALL.

473
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,704
OH, COME ON.

474
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,706
HE'S GLAD THAT I CAME.

475
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,209
HE DOESN'T WANT ME TO GO ANYWHERE.

476
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,711
BALLS FLYING ALL OVER THE PLACE.

477
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,215
RACHEL, THIS IS MY FRIEND, TOM.

478
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,717
THIS IS THE GIRL I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

479
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,221
OH, COME ON, YOU'RE TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT ME?

480
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,722
I THINK YOU TWO

481
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,724
COULD REALLY HIT IT OFF.

482
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,725
I'M GOING TO GO MINGLE.

483
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,729
SO, YOU WORK AT BLOOMINGDALE'S, HUH?

484
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,732
MY MOM CALLS IT "BLOOMIES."

485
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,738
OH... YEAH.

486
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,241
OKAY. AT EASE, SOLDIER.

487
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,244
I'M SORRY?

488
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,245
NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

489
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,746
YOU CAN JUST DROP THE ACT, TOMMY.

490
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,248
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

491
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,250
YOU'RE DANNY'S WINGMAN, RIGHT?

492
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,251
YOU GUYS ARE BEST BUDS.

493
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,752
FRAT BROS.

494
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,757
I'M GOING TO GO TALK TO A FRIEND.

495
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,760
YEAH, YEAH. YOU GO TALK TO YOUR FRIEND.

496
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,263
YOU GO TELL HIM, "NICE TRY."

497
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,770
MAN, YOU KNOW, HE JUST KEEPS LOBBING THEM UP AND I JUST KEEP

498
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,772
KNOCKING THEM RIGHT OUT OF THE PARK.

499
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,775
I THINK I NEED A DRINK.

500
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,776
YEAH.

501
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,784
98... 99...

502
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,786
ONE... HUNDRED.

503
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,288
OKAY. GO.

504
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,290
DUDE, I'M TELLING YOU, I'M FINE.

505
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,796
HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO.

506
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,298
HEY.

507
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,799
HEY.

508
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,302
SO, I, UH... I DIDN'T GET THAT APARTMENT.

509
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,304
SOME PROBLEM WITH MY APPLICATION.

510
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,306
 YOU'RE KIDDING!

511
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,807
YEAH, BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS

512
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,808
PHOEBE SAID I COULD STAY

513
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,810
AT HER PLACE FOR A WHILE, SO...

514
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,812
WELL, YOU CAN'T STAY WITH PHOEBE, ROSS.

515
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,813
WE'RE ROOMIES.

516
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,815
LOOK, YOU GUYS DON'T NEED ME HERE

517
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,816
TAKING UP ALL YOUR SPACE.

518
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,818
WE GOT PLENTY OF SPACE.

519
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,821
THERE'S STILL SOME OVER THERE BY THAT SPEAKER.

520
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,823
PLEASE, JUST STAY.

521
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,825
YEAH.

522
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,327
ARE YOU GUYS SURE ABOUT THIS?

523
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,328
DEFINITELY, YES.

524
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,330
YES. ROSS, YOU HAVE TO STAY.

525
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,832
ALL RIGHT.

526
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,833
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

527
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,835
HEY.

528
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,837
SO I'M A PIMP, HUH?

529
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,342
IT'S OKAY.

530
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,345
LOOK, I KNOW SOMETIMES I CAN BE A PAIN IN THE ASS

531
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,347
BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO TALK TO ME.

532
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,849
TELL ME IF SOMETHING'S BOTHERING YOU, OKAY?

533
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,852
AND FOR MY PART, I'LL REALLY DO EVERYTHING I CAN

534
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,355
TO KEEP MY ANNOYING HABITS YOU KNOW, JUST...

535
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,372
WELL, I SEE YOU'VE HAD A VERY PRODUCTIVE DAY.

536
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,875
DON'T YOU THINK THE COWBOY HAT'S A LITTLE MUCH?

537
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,378
COME ON, IT'S FUN.

538
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,382
ALL RIGHT.

539
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,890
ISN'T THIS A WOMAN'S HAT?

540
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,893
DUDE, STOP TALKING CRAZY AND MAKE US SOME TEA.
