1668
01:10:02,033 --> 01:10:04,035
 COME IN.

1669
01:10:04,035 --> 01:10:06,838
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

1670
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,441
HI, I JUST...

1671
01:10:10,441 --> 01:10:11,643

1672
01:10:11,643 --> 01:10:13,244
MY GOD!

1673
01:10:13,244 --> 01:10:14,445
OH, MY GOD, MONICA!

1674
01:10:14,445 --> 01:10:15,647
OH, MY GOD.

1675
01:10:15,647 --> 01:10:17,248
I'M SORRY. SORRY.

1676
01:10:17,248 --> 01:10:18,449
I I WAS, UM...

1677
01:10:18,449 --> 01:10:20,051
I WAS TAKING A NAP.

1678
01:10:20,051 --> 01:10:22,854
SINCE WHEN DO YOU TAKE NAPS IN THAT POSITION?

1679
01:10:24,856 --> 01:10:26,858
OH, GOD, MONICA, TELL ME YOU WERE WAITING FOR A GUY.

1680
01:10:26,858 --> 01:10:28,459
PLEASE TELL ME YOU WERE WAITING FOR A GUY.

1681
01:10:28,459 --> 01:10:29,661
YES. YES, I WAS.

1682
01:10:29,661 --> 01:10:31,262
A GUY.

1683
01:10:31,262 --> 01:10:32,864
FROM WORK.

1684
01:10:32,864 --> 01:10:34,866
I'M SEEING A GUY FROM WORK!

1685
01:10:34,866 --> 01:10:36,467
HA!

1686
01:10:36,467 --> 01:10:39,270
OH, THAT CUTE WAITER GUY FROM YOUR RESTAURANT.

1687
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:42,473
THE ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE A NON THREATENING RAY LIOTTA?

1688
01:10:42,473 --> 01:10:44,075
UH HUH! THAT ONE.

1689
01:10:44,075 --> 01:10:45,276
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1690
01:10:45,276 --> 01:10:47,679
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND, I'LL BE OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

1691
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:49,280
I'M JUST GOING TO GRAB A JACKET.

1692
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:53,284
WHEN I GET BACK, I WANT EVERY LITTLE DETAIL.

1693
01:10:54,602 --> 01:10:56,404

1694
01:10:56,404 --> 01:10:57,605
MAYBE THAT'S HIM.

1695
01:10:57,605 --> 01:10:58,806
OKAY, UM...

1696
01:10:58,806 --> 01:11:00,808
OKAY, UM...

1697
01:11:02,009 --> 01:11:04,812
IT'S JUST JOEY AND ROSS.

1698
01:11:04,812 --> 01:11:06,414
WHY AREN'T YOU GUYS AT THE MOVIE?

1699
01:11:06,414 --> 01:11:08,416
WELL, WE WERE, BUT ROSS WAS TALKING SO LOUD ON HIS PHONE

1700
01:11:08,416 --> 01:11:10,017
THEY THREW US OUT.

1701
01:11:10,017 --> 01:11:13,621
I HAD TO TALK LOUD BECAUSE THE MOVIE WAS LOUD.

1702
01:11:14,822 --> 01:11:16,023
HE'S TALKING TO LONDON.

1703
01:11:16,023 --> 01:11:17,225
OH, MY GOD!

1704
01:11:17,225 --> 01:11:18,826
DID HE GET IN TOUCH WITH EMILY?

1705
01:11:18,826 --> 01:11:20,027
WELL, NO. NOT YET.

1706
01:11:20,027 --> 01:11:22,029
HE'S CALLING EVERYONE ON HER SIDE OF THE FAMILY

1707
01:11:22,029 --> 01:11:24,432
HOPING THAT SOMEONE WILL HELP HIM GET IN TOUCH WITH HER.

1708
01:11:24,432 --> 01:11:28,035
I DON'T CARE IF I SAID SOME OTHER GIRL'S NAME

1709
01:11:28,035 --> 01:11:30,037
YOU PRISSY OLD TWIT!

1710
01:11:30,037 --> 01:11:31,239
HEY, ROSS.

1711
01:11:31,239 --> 01:11:34,041
WAY TO SUCK UP TO THE FAMILY.

1712
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:35,643

1713
01:11:35,643 --> 01:11:37,645
AH... AH...

1714
01:11:40,448 --> 01:11:42,850
I'M SO GLAD YOU GUYS ARE ALL HERE.

1715
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:46,454
MY OFFICE FINALLY GOT WRINKLE FREE FAX PAPER!

1716
01:11:53,661 --> 01:11:58,866
?  ?

1717
01:11:58,866 --> 01:12:01,269
?  ?

1718
01:12:01,269 --> 01:12:04,071
?  ?

1719
01:12:04,071 --> 01:12:08,476
?  ?

1721
01:12:10,478 --> 01:12:13,281
?  ?

1722
01:12:13,281 --> 01:12:17,018
?  ?

1723
01:12:17,018 --> 01:12:19,020
?  ?

1724
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:21,823
?  ?

1725
01:12:21,823 --> 01:12:23,825
?  ?

1726
01:12:24,225 --> 01:12:27,028
?  ?

1727
01:12:27,428 --> 01:12:32,633
?  ?

1728
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:39,073
OH, HI. IS THIS NANNY HOPKINS?

1729
01:12:39,073 --> 01:12:41,075
I'M LOOKING FOR EMILY.

1730
01:12:41,075 --> 01:12:42,677
WALTHAM.

1731
01:12:42,677 --> 01:12:44,278
OH, I I'M SORRY.

1732
01:12:44,278 --> 01:12:53,888
IS THIS 011-44-742-934-742-67?

1733
01:12:55,089 --> 01:12:57,892
OH, IT'S FOUR THREE, NOT FOUR TWO.

1734
01:12:57,892 --> 01:13:01,095
AH, W WELL, WHICH FOUR TWO?

1735
01:13:01,496 --> 01:13:03,498
NO, NO, NO. HEY.

1736
01:13:03,498 --> 01:13:06,300
VOMIT TUX. NO, NO. VOMIT TUX.

1737
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:08,302
DON'T WORRY. I HAD IT DRY CLEANED.

1738
01:13:08,703 --> 01:13:09,904
VOMIT TUX?

1739
01:13:09,904 --> 01:13:11,506
WHO VOMITED ON...

1740
01:13:11,506 --> 01:13:13,107
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1741
01:13:13,107 --> 01:13:15,510
WHAT YOU UP TO, JOE?

1742
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:18,713
WELL, THEY'RE DOING THIS TELETHON THING ON TV

1743
01:13:18,713 --> 01:13:21,115
AND MY AGENT GOT ME A JOB AS COHOST.

1744
01:13:21,115 --> 01:13:23,117
OH, THAT'S GREAT!

1745
01:13:23,117 --> 01:13:27,522
A LITTLE GOOD DEED FOR PBS, PLUS SOME TV EXPOSURE.

1746
01:13:27,522 --> 01:13:31,526
NOW, THAT'S THE KIND OF MATH JOEY LIKES TO DO.

1747
01:13:31,526 --> 01:13:33,928
YUCK! PBS.

1748
01:13:33,928 --> 01:13:35,129
WHAT'S WRONG WITH PBS?

1749
01:13:35,129 --> 01:13:36,731
WHAT'S RIGHT WITH THEM?

1750
01:13:38,332 --> 01:13:39,934
WHY DON'T YOU LIKE PBS, PHEEBS?

1751
01:13:39,934 --> 01:13:42,336
OKAY, BECAUSE RIGHT AFTER MY MOM KILLED HERSELF

1752
01:13:42,336 --> 01:13:45,540
I WAS JUST IN THIS REALLY BAD PLACE, YOU KNOW, PERSONALLY.

1753
01:13:47,542 --> 01:13:49,944
I JUST THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL BETTER

1754
01:13:49,944 --> 01:13:51,546
IF I WROTE TO SESAME STREET

1755
01:13:51,546 --> 01:13:53,948
BECAUSE THEY WERE SO NICE WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID.

1756
01:13:53,948 --> 01:13:55,550
NO ONE EVER WROTE BACK.

1757
01:13:55,950 --> 01:13:59,153
WELL, YOU KNOW A LOT OF THOSE MUPPETS DON'T HAVE THUMBS.

1758
01:13:59,153 --> 01:14:01,956
ALL I GOT WAS A LOUSY KEY CHAIN

1759
01:14:01,956 --> 01:14:05,159
AND BY THAT TIME, I WAS LIVING IN A BOX.

1760
01:14:05,159 --> 01:14:06,761
I DIDN'T HAVE KEYS.

1761
01:14:06,761 --> 01:14:07,962
I'M SORRY, PHEEBS.

1762
01:14:07,962 --> 01:14:08,763
I JUST, YOU KNOW

1763
01:14:09,163 --> 01:14:11,165
I JUST WANTED TO DO A GOOD DEED LIKE...

1764
01:14:11,165 --> 01:14:12,767
LIKE YOU DID WITH THE BABIES.

1765
01:14:12,767 --> 01:14:13,968
THIS ISN'T A GOOD DEED.

1766
01:14:13,968 --> 01:14:15,570
YOU JUST WANT TO GET ON TV.

1767
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:17,171
THIS IS TOTALLY SELFISH.

1768
01:14:17,171 --> 01:14:18,773
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

1769
01:14:18,773 --> 01:14:21,576
WHAT ABOUT YOU HAVING THOSE BABIES FOR YOUR BROTHER?

1770
01:14:21,976 --> 01:14:23,177
TALK ABOUT SELFISH.

1771
01:14:23,177 --> 01:14:26,781
WHAT... WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1772
01:14:27,181 --> 01:14:28,783
WELL, YEAH, IT WAS A REALLY NICE THING AND ALL

1773
01:14:28,783 --> 01:14:30,384
BUT IT MADE YOU FEEL REALLY GOOD, RIGHT?

1774
01:14:30,384 --> 01:14:31,986
YEAH. SO?

1775
01:14:31,986 --> 01:14:35,590
WELL, IT MADE YOU FEEL GOOD, SO THAT MAKES IT SELFISH.

1776
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:38,392
LOOK, THERE'S NOUN SELFISH GOOD DEEDS. SORRY.

1777
01:14:38,392 --> 01:14:39,594
YES, THERE ARE.

1778
01:14:39,594 --> 01:14:42,396
THERE ARE TOTALLY GOOD DEEDS THAT ARE SELFLESS.

1779
01:14:42,396 --> 01:14:44,398
WELL, MAY I ASK FOR ONE EXAMPLE?

1780
01:14:44,398 --> 01:14:47,602
YEAH, IT'S... YOU KNOW... THERE'S...

1781
01:14:47,602 --> 01:14:49,604
NO, YOU MAY NOT.

1782
01:14:49,604 --> 01:14:53,608
THAT'S BECAUSE ALL PEOPLE ARE SELFISH.

1783
01:14:53,608 --> 01:14:56,410
ARE YOU CALLING ME SELFISH?

1784
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:59,213
ARE YOU CALLING YOU PEOPLE?

1785
01:14:59,213 --> 01:15:00,414
YEAH. WELL...

1786
01:15:00,414 --> 01:15:02,416
SORRY TO BURST THAT BUBBLE, PHEEBS

1787
01:15:02,416 --> 01:15:04,819
BUT SELFLESS GOOD DEEDS DON'T EXIST, OKAY?

1788
01:15:04,819 --> 01:15:07,622
AND YOU KNOW THE DEAL ON SANTA CLAUS, RIGHT?

1789
01:15:07,622 --> 01:15:10,825
I'M GOING TO FIND A SELFLESS GOOD DEED.

1790
01:15:10,825 --> 01:15:14,028
I'M GOING TO BEAT YOU, YOU EVIL GENIUS.

1791
01:15:14,028 --> 01:15:15,630

1792
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:17,231
HELLO?

1793
01:15:17,231 --> 01:15:18,833
HELLO, ROSS?

1794
01:15:18,833 --> 01:15:20,835
EMILY? EM... OH, MY GOD!

1795
01:15:20,835 --> 01:15:22,036
OH, MY GOD, IT'S EMILY!

1796
01:15:22,036 --> 01:15:23,638
IT'S EMILY, EVERYONE!

1797
01:15:23,638 --> 01:15:24,839
SHH! SHH!

1798
01:15:26,841 --> 01:15:28,042
HI.

1799
01:15:28,042 --> 01:15:29,644
ROSS, I'M ONLY RINGING

1800
01:15:29,644 --> 01:15:32,046
TO SAY STOP HARASSING MY RELATIVES. GOOD BYE.

1801
01:15:32,046 --> 01:15:33,648
NO. WAIT, WAIT. LOOK. OKAY, OKAY.

1802
01:15:33,648 --> 01:15:36,067
YOU CAN HANG UP, BUT I'M GOING TO KEEP CALLING.

1803
01:15:36,067 --> 01:15:37,685
I'M GOING TO CALL EVERYONE IN ENGLAND

1804
01:15:37,685 --> 01:15:40,087
IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO GET YOU TO TALK TO ME.

1805
01:15:40,087 --> 01:15:42,089
REALLY? ABOUT WHAT?

1806
01:15:42,089 --> 01:15:43,290
LOOK, YOU'RE MY WIFE.

1807
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:45,292
WE'RE... WE'RE MARRIED, YOU KNOW.

1808
01:15:45,292 --> 01:15:46,894
I... I LOVE YOU. I...

1809
01:15:46,894 --> 01:15:48,496
I really miss you.

1810
01:15:50,498 --> 01:15:52,099
I MISS YOU, TOO.

1811
01:15:52,099 --> 01:15:54,502
Well, at least I think I do.

1812
01:15:54,502 --> 01:15:56,103
SHE'S TALKING.

1813
01:15:56,103 --> 01:15:58,105
YAY!

1814
01:16:00,908 --> 01:16:02,109
HEY, JOEY, WHEN

1815
01:16:02,109 --> 01:16:05,312
YOU SAID THE DEAL WITH SANTA CLAUS, YOU MEANT...

1816
01:16:05,312 --> 01:16:06,514
THAT HE DOESN'T EXIST.

1817
01:16:06,914 --> 01:16:08,115
RIGHT.

1818
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,522
SO, CHANDLER, HAVE YOU HEARD

1819
01:16:14,522 --> 01:16:16,524

1820
01:16:16,524 --> 01:16:18,125
UH... YEAH. SHE, UH...

1821
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:20,528
SHE, UH... SHE MIGHT HAVE MENTIONED HIM. YEAH.

1822
01:16:20,528 --> 01:16:22,129
SO, MON

1823
01:16:22,129 --> 01:16:25,733
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO MEET THIS NEW SECRET WAITER MAN?

1824
01:16:25,733 --> 01:16:26,934
OH, HE'S REALLY SHY.

1825
01:16:26,934 --> 01:16:28,936
I DON'T THINK HE'S UP TO MEETING EVERYONE YET.

1826
01:16:28,936 --> 01:16:32,139
YEAH, I DON'T THINK HE'S UP TO MEETING EVERYONE YET.

1827
01:16:32,139 --> 01:16:33,340
I DON'T CARE.

1828
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:36,143
I WANT TO MEET THIS GUY WHO'S THE BEST SEX SHE EVER HAD.

1829
01:16:36,143 --> 01:16:38,145
REALLY?

1830
01:16:40,147 --> 01:16:41,348
THAT'S WHAT YOU HEARD?

1831
01:16:41,749 --> 01:16:42,950
YOU SAID THAT?

1832
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:44,952
I MIGHT HAVE SAID THAT.

1833
01:16:44,952 --> 01:16:47,755

1834
01:16:47,755 --> 01:16:49,356
WHY IS THAT FUNNY?

1835
01:16:49,356 --> 01:16:50,958
BECAUSE I'M VERY

1836
01:16:50,958 --> 01:16:52,960
HAPPY FOR HIM.

1837
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,763
AND YOU,YOU LUCKY DOG.

1838
01:16:57,765 --> 01:16:58,566
HI.

01:16:58,566 --> 01:17:00,167
HEY. HI.

1840
01:17:00,167 --> 01:17:02,570
WELL, EMILY'S WILLING TO WORK ON THE RELATIONSHIP.

1841
01:17:02,570 --> 01:17:03,771
THAT'S GREAT!

1842
01:17:03,771 --> 01:17:04,972
IN LONDON.

1843
01:17:04,972 --> 01:17:06,173
WHAT?

1844
01:17:06,173 --> 01:17:08,375
SHE WANTS ME TO MOVE TO LONDON.

1845
01:17:08,375 --> 01:17:09,577
BUT YOU LIVE HERE.

1846
01:17:12,663 --> 01:17:14,665
YOU KNOW THAT.

1847
01:17:15,066 --> 01:17:17,068
WHAT... WHAT... WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

1848
01:17:17,068 --> 01:17:18,269
I DON'T KNOW.

1849
01:17:18,269 --> 01:17:19,870
I MEAN, I CAN'T LEAVE BEN.

1850
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:21,872
YOU COULD JUST VIDEO CONFERENCE WITH HIM.

1851
01:17:23,474 --> 01:17:26,277
I'M NOT READY TO HAVE A CHILD.

1852
01:17:26,277 --> 01:17:29,080
I BET IF I TALKED TO CAROL AND SUSAN

1853
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:34,285
I COULD CONVINCE THEM TO MOVE TO LONDON WITH BEN.

1854
01:17:34,685 --> 01:17:36,687
YEAH. I'M SURE YOUR EX WIFE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY

1855
01:17:37,088 --> 01:17:38,289
TO MOVE TO ANOTHER COUNTRY

1856
01:17:38,289 --> 01:17:40,291
SO YOU CAN PATCH THINGS UP WITH YOUR NEW WIFE.

1857
01:17:42,293 --> 01:17:44,295
IT COULD HAPPEN.

1858
01:17:46,697 --> 01:17:49,500
ROSS, WE ARE NOT MOVING TO LONDON.

1859
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,502
WE ALREADY HAVE LIVES HERE.

1860
01:17:51,502 --> 01:17:52,703

01:18:01,112 --> 01:18:03,914
THEY HAVE A QUEEN.

1864
01:18:03,914 --> 01:18:05,516
SO?

1865
01:18:05,516 --> 01:18:06,717
SHE SHE'S A WOMAN.

1866
01:18:06,717 --> 01:18:08,319

1867
01:18:08,319 --> 01:18:09,520
HEY.

01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:10,721

WE'RE MOVING TO LONDON! YAY!

1872
01:18:16,327 --> 01:18:17,928
WHO'S GOING TO LONDON?

1873
01:18:18,329 --> 01:18:19,930
NOBODY'S GOING TO LONDON.

1874
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:22,733
WELCOME TO LONDON, GOVERNOR.

1875
01:18:22,733 --> 01:18:24,335
RIGHT? RIGHT?

1876
01:18:24,335 --> 01:18:26,737

AND LITTLE BEN IN THE SAME CITY. HOO HOO!

1878
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:30,741
HEY, GO PACK.

1879
01:18:30,741 --> 01:18:33,544
SEE? SEE?

1880
01:18:33,544 --> 01:18:35,146
HE WANTS TO GO.

1881
01:18:35,146 --> 01:18:38,749
YEAH, WE LEAVE ALL OUR BIG DECISIONS TO THE THREE YEAR OLD.

1882
01:18:38,749 --> 01:18:42,753
COME ON, COME ON,  IT'LL BE JUST LIKE, UH, THREE'S COMPANY

1883
01:18:43,154 --> 01:18:46,357

01:18:46,357 --> 01:18:48,759
AND AND YOU'RE THE GAY ONES.

1885
01:18:53,964 --> 01:18:55,166
HOW YOU DOING?

1886
01:18:55,566 --> 01:18:56,767
WELCOME.

1887
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,369
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

1888
01:18:58,369 --> 01:18:59,970
THIS WILL BE YOUR PHONE.

1889
01:19:03,574 --> 01:19:05,176
THAT'S GREAT, BUT, UH...

1890
01:19:05,176 --> 01:19:08,379
I'M NOT REALLY EXPECTING A LOT OF CALLS.

1891
01:19:08,379 --> 01:19:11,182
NO, YOU ANSWER IT AND TAKE PLEDGES.

1892
01:19:11,182 --> 01:19:12,383
BUT I'M THE HOST.

1893
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:14,785
NO, GARY COLLINS IS THE HOST.

1894
01:19:14,785 --> 01:19:17,188
YOU'LL BE ANSWERING THE PHONE.

1895
01:19:17,188 --> 01:19:19,590
YOU DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND.

1896
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:21,992
SEE, I WAS DR. DRAKE RAMORAY.

1897
01:19:21,992 --> 01:19:24,795
WELL, HERE'S YOUR PHONE, DOCTOR.

1898
01:19:27,198 --> 01:19:28,799
I CANNOT BELIEVE I CAN'T FIND

1899
01:19:28,799 --> 01:19:30,000
A SELFLESS GOOD DEED.

1900
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,602
YOU KNOW THAT REALLY OLD GUY

1901
01:19:31,602 --> 01:19:32,803
THAT LIVES NEXT DOOR TO ME?

1902
01:19:32,803 --> 01:19:36,407
WELL, I SNUCK OVER THERE AND RAKED UP ALL THE LEAVES

1903
01:19:36,407 --> 01:19:38,409
ON HIS FRONT STOOP, BUT HE CAUGHT ME

1904
01:19:38,409 --> 01:19:40,811
AND FORCE FED ME CIDER AND COOKIES.

1905
01:19:42,413 --> 01:19:44,415
THEN I FELT WONDERFUL.

1906
01:19:44,815 --> 01:19:46,417
THAT OLD JACKASS.

1907
01:19:46,417 --> 01:19:48,018
YOU KNOW, MAYBE JOEY'S RIGHT.

1908
01:19:48,018 --> 01:19:50,020
MAYBE ALL GOOD DEEDS ARE SELFISH.

1909
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:52,022
I WILL FIND A SELFLESS GOOD DEED

1910
01:19:52,022 --> 01:19:54,425
BECAUSE I JUST GAVE BIRTH TO THREE CHILDREN

1911
01:19:54,825 --> 01:19:56,427
AND I WILL NOT LET THEM BE RAISED

1912
01:19:56,427 --> 01:19:58,429
IN A WORLD WHERE JOEY IS RIGHT.

1913
01:19:58,429 --> 01:19:59,630
HEY, MONICA?

1914
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:01,632
CAN I ASK YOU A COOKING QUESTION?

1915
01:20:01,632 --> 01:20:02,833
SURE.

1916
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:04,835
IF YOU'RE COOKING ON THE STOVE

1917
01:20:04,835 --> 01:20:07,238
DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOUR NEW SECRET BOYFRIEND

1918
01:20:07,638 --> 01:20:09,240
IS BETTER IN BED THAN RICHARD?

1919
01:20:10,841 --> 01:20:12,042
CHANDLER!

1920
01:20:13,244 --> 01:20:15,246
IS HE?

1921
01:20:16,447 --> 01:20:17,648
LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

1922
01:20:17,648 --> 01:20:19,650
I THINK I'M GOING TO RESPECT THE PRIVACY

1923
01:20:19,650 --> 01:20:20,851
OF MY NEW SECRET BOYFRIEND.

1924
01:20:20,851 --> 01:20:22,853
WHY?

1925
01:20:24,855 --> 01:20:26,457
I MEAN, IF THIS GUY WAS ME

1926
01:20:26,457 --> 01:20:28,058
AND IT WAS ME WHO WOULD LEARN

1927
01:20:28,058 --> 01:20:30,861
THAT IT WAS ME WHO WAS THE BEST YOU'D EVER HAD

1928
01:20:30,861 --> 01:20:32,463
I'D BE GOING LIKE THIS.

1929
01:20:42,589 --> 01:20:43,590
 ALL RIGHT, EMILY

1930
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:45,659
AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOU

1931
01:20:45,659 --> 01:20:49,263
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T MOVE TO LONDON WITHOUT BEN.

1932
01:20:49,663 --> 01:20:52,466
I UNDERSTAND THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT.

1933
01:20:52,466 --> 01:20:54,468
WOULD YOU PLEASE CONSIDER MOVING HERE?

1934
01:20:54,468 --> 01:20:56,470
I MEAN, YOU WERE GOING TO MOVE HERE ANYWAY.

1935
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:58,872
Why can't you just do that?

1936
01:20:58,872 --> 01:21:01,275
OH, I DON'T KNOW. IT'S JUST...

1937
01:21:01,275 --> 01:21:03,277
O OKAY, OKAY, BUT I KNOW

1938
01:21:03,277 --> 01:21:08,082
THAT EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN A COMPLETE IDIOT UP TILL NOW

1939
01:21:08,082 --> 01:21:10,084
Y YOU HAVE TO COME HERE.

1940
01:21:10,084 --> 01:21:13,287
You have to, so we can work this out together.

1941
01:21:14,488 --> 01:21:15,689
ALL RIGHT.

1942
01:21:15,689 --> 01:21:16,890
A ALL RIGHT?

1943
01:21:16,890 --> 01:21:18,492
DID YOU JUST SAY ALL RIGHT?

1944
01:21:18,492 --> 01:21:21,295
I DID. NOW I'M THE IDIOT.

1945
01:21:21,295 --> 01:21:23,547
OH, EMILY, THAT IS SO GREAT!

1946
01:21:23,547 --> 01:21:25,182
It's going to be so great!

1947
01:21:25,182 --> 01:21:29,136
WE'RE GOING TO BE LIKE, LIKE TWO IDIOTS IN LOVE!

1948
01:21:29,136 --> 01:21:31,138

1949
01:21:32,573 --> 01:21:35,826
ROSS, THERE'S ONE THING THAT REALLY SCARES ME STILL.

1950
01:21:35,826 --> 01:21:37,027
YES, TELL ME.

1951
01:21:37,027 --> 01:21:38,228
You have to understand

1952
01:21:38,228 --> 01:21:41,031
HOW HUMILIATING IT WAS FOR ME UP ON THAT ALTAR

1953
01:21:41,031 --> 01:21:43,834
IN FRONT OF MY ENTIRE FAMILY, ALL MY FRIENDS.

1954
01:21:43,834 --> 01:21:47,037
I KNOW. I AM... I AM SO SORRY.

1955
01:21:47,037 --> 01:21:50,240
AND THEN, AFTER DECIDING TO FORGIVE YOU

1956
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:54,645
SEEING YOU AT THE AIRPORT, CATCHIN GOURP LANE WITH HER.

1957
01:21:54,645 --> 01:21:57,848
AGAIN, VERY SORRY.

1958
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:02,252
I MEAN, I CAN'T BE IN THE SAME ROOM AS HER.

1959
01:22:02,252 --> 01:22:04,655
IT DRIVES ME MAD JUST THINKING OF YOU

1960
01:22:04,655 --> 01:22:06,256
BEING IN THE SAME ROOM AS HER.

1961
01:22:06,657 --> 01:22:11,128
EMILY, THERE IS NOTHING BETWEEN RACHEL AND ME.

1962
01:22:11,128 --> 01:22:15,149
Okay? I love you.

1963
01:22:15,149 --> 01:22:17,551
ALL RIGHT.

1964
01:22:17,551 --> 01:22:21,555
I'LL COME TO NEW YORK, AND WE'LL TRY TO MAKE THIS WORK.

1965
01:22:21,555 --> 01:22:23,157
AH, THAT IS SO GREAT! THAT'S...

1966
01:22:23,157 --> 01:22:26,760
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T SEE RACHEL ANYMORE.

1967
01:22:34,768 --> 01:22:35,969
...SO I ASKED EMILY

1968
01:22:35,969 --> 01:22:37,571
IF SHE WOULD COME TO NEW YORK

1969
01:22:37,571 --> 01:22:39,973
AND SHE SAID YES.

1970
01:22:39,973 --> 01:22:41,175
YES!

1971
01:22:41,575 --> 01:22:42,376
NO, NO, NO.

1972
01:22:42,776 --> 01:22:46,780
ONLY IF I PROMISED NEVER TO SEE RACHEL AGAIN.

1973
01:22:46,780 --> 01:22:48,382
WHAT? YOU CAN'T...

1974
01:22:48,782 --> 01:22:49,983
WHAT DID YOU TELL HER?

1975
01:22:49,983 --> 01:22:51,985
I TOLD HER I'D HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT.

1976
01:22:51,985 --> 01:22:54,788
I MEAN, HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO MAKE

1977
01:22:54,788 --> 01:22:56,390
THIS KIND OF A DECISION?

1978
01:22:56,390 --> 01:22:58,792
I'M ACTUALLY ASKING YOU.

1979
01:23:00,394 --> 01:23:02,396
WELL, YOU CAN'T JUST NOT SEE RACHEL ANYMORE.

1980
01:23:02,396 --> 01:23:03,597
SHE'S ONE OF YOUR BEST FRIENDS.

1981
01:23:03,597 --> 01:23:05,599
YEAH, BUT HE

1982
01:23:05,599 --> 01:23:07,201
CANNOT NOT SEE EMILY. THAT'S HIS WIFE.

1983
01:23:07,201 --> 01:23:08,802
YEAH. RIGHT ON. THAT'S TRUE.

1984
01:23:08,802 --> 01:23:10,821
YEAH, BUT

1985
01:23:10,821 --> 01:23:12,823
YOU'VE KNOWN RACHEL SINCE HIGH SCHOOL

1986
01:23:12,823 --> 01:23:15,225
AND YOU CANNOT JUST CUT HER OUT OF YOUR LIFE.

1987
01:23:15,626 --> 01:23:16,827
NO, YOU CANNOT. THAT'S TRUE.

1988
01:23:16,827 --> 01:23:18,028
THANKS FOR THE HELP.

1989
01:23:18,429 --> 01:23:20,030
PROBLEM SOLVED.

1990
01:23:21,632 --> 01:23:23,634

1991
01:23:24,835 --> 01:23:25,636
HELLO.

1992
01:23:25,636 --> 01:23:26,837
HEY, MON.

1993
01:23:26,837 --> 01:23:27,638
Oh, hey, Joey.

1994
01:23:27,638 --> 01:23:28,839
WE'VE BEEN WATCHING ALL DAY.

1995
01:23:28,839 --> 01:23:29,640
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE ON TV?

1996
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,241
SEE, THERE WAS KIND OF

1997
01:23:31,241 --> 01:23:33,243
A MIX UP IN MY AGENT'S OFFICE

1998
01:23:33,243 --> 01:23:36,847
BUT I'M STILL ON TV AND THAT'S GOOD EXPOSURE.

1999
01:23:36,847 --> 01:23:38,849
 YOU'RE NOT ON TV.

2000
01:23:38,849 --> 01:23:40,451
UH, OKAY.

2001
01:23:40,451 --> 01:23:44,455
HOW... HOW ABOUT NOW?

2002
01:23:44,455 --> 01:23:46,457

YEAH! THERE HE IS!

2004
01:23:48,459 --> 01:23:51,261
Hello, New York.

2005
01:23:51,261 --> 01:23:54,465
Maybe you just like want to put the whole duck in there.

2006
01:23:54,465 --> 01:23:55,666
Who cares? You know?

2007
01:23:55,666 --> 01:23:57,267
Now, I got the legs...

2008
01:23:57,267 --> 01:23:58,469
OH! OH!

2009
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:03,273
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU GUYS

2010
01:24:03,273 --> 01:24:06,477
TO NEVER WATCH THE COOKING CHANNEL.

2011
01:24:06,477 --> 01:24:08,078
HI, CHANDLER.

2012
01:24:08,078 --> 01:24:09,680
HEY.

2013
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:10,481
I NEED THAT BROILING PAN

2014
01:24:10,481 --> 01:24:12,082
THAT JOEY BORROWED THE OTHER DAY.

2015
01:24:12,082 --> 01:24:12,883
OH, THAT WAS YOURS?

2016
01:24:13,283 --> 01:24:14,485
MM HMM.

2017
01:24:14,485 --> 01:24:18,489
YEAH, WE USED IT WHEN THE DUCK WAS THROWING UP CATERPILLARS.

2018
01:24:18,489 --> 01:24:21,692
WILLIAMS SONOMA, FALL CATALOG, PAGE 27.

2019
01:24:21,692 --> 01:24:23,293
EXPECT IT IN FOUR TO SIX WEEKS.

2020
01:24:24,495 --> 01:24:26,497

01:24:29,299 --> 01:24:31,702
WE HAVE THE WHOLE PLACE TO OURSELVES.

2023
01:24:32,102 --> 01:24:33,704
YEAH? SO?

2024
01:24:33,704 --> 01:24:37,307
WELL, I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D WANT TO BOOK SOME TIME

2025
01:24:37,307 --> 01:24:39,309
WITH THE BEST YOU'VE EVER HAD.

2026
01:24:39,309 --> 01:24:41,712
YOU KNOW WHAT, CHAMP?

2027
01:24:41,712 --> 01:24:43,313
I THINK I'LL PASS.

2028
01:24:43,313 --> 01:24:44,515
WHY?

2029
01:24:44,515 --> 01:24:45,716
WHY?

2030
01:24:58,929 --> 01:25:01,331
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

2031
01:25:01,331 --> 01:25:02,933
WITH ALL THIS STUPID GLOATING

2032
01:25:02,933 --> 01:25:05,335
WOULD YOU WANT TO SLEEP WITH YOU?

2033
01:25:05,335 --> 01:25:06,937
WELL, I THINK I'D BE A LITTLE OUT OF MY LEAGUE

2034
01:25:07,337 --> 01:25:08,539
BUT I'D GIVE IT A SHOT.

2035
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:12,943

2036
01:25:12,943 --> 01:25:16,146
PBS TELETHON.

2037
01:25:16,146 --> 01:25:18,549
HEY, JOEY, I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW

2038
01:25:18,549 --> 01:25:20,951
THAT I FOUND A SELFLESS GOOD DEED.

2039
01:25:20,951 --> 01:25:24,154
I WENT DOWN TO THE PARK AND I LET A BEE STING ME.

2040
01:25:24,154 --> 01:25:26,957
WHAT? WHAT GOOD IS THAT GOING TO DO ANYBODY?

2041
01:25:26,957 --> 01:25:28,559
WELL, IT HELPS THE BEE

2042
01:25:28,559 --> 01:25:31,361
LOOK TOUGH IN FRONT OF HIS BEE FRIENDS.

2043
01:25:31,361 --> 01:25:34,164
THE BEE IS HAPPY, AND I AM DEFINITELY NOT.

2044
01:25:34,164 --> 01:25:38,168
YOU KNOW THE BEE PROBABLY DIED AFTER HE STUNG YOU.

2045
01:25:42,172 --> 01:25:43,774
DAMN IT.

2046
01:25:46,977 --> 01:25:48,579
BACK ON IN 30 SECONDS, PEOPLE.

2047
01:25:55,435 --> 01:25:56,637
HEY, EXCUSE ME.

2048
01:25:56,637 --> 01:25:59,439
WOULD YOU MIND SWITCHING WITH ME? I'M JUST...

2049
01:25:59,439 --> 01:26:01,441
OH, NO WAY. I'M IN THE SHOT, MAN.

2050
01:26:01,441 --> 01:26:03,443
COME ON, MAN, YOU'VE BEEN HERE ALL DAY.

2051
01:26:03,443 --> 01:26:05,445
MAN, I'M TAKING PLEDGES HERE, HUH?

2052
01:26:05,445 --> 01:26:06,246
AND WE'RE ON

2053
01:26:06,246 --> 01:26:07,848
IN THREE, TWO...

2054
01:26:07,848 --> 01:26:09,850
WELCOME BACK TO OUR FALL TELETHON.

2055
01:26:09,850 --> 01:26:11,852
NOW, IF YOU'VE BEEN ENJOYING

2056
01:26:11,852 --> 01:26:13,854
THE PERFORMANCE OF CIRQUE DE SOLEIL

2057
01:26:13,854 --> 01:26:17,057
AND YOU'D LIKE TO SEE MORE OF THE SAME KIND OF PROGRAMMING

2058
01:26:17,057 --> 01:26:18,659
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

2059
01:26:18,659 --> 01:26:21,061
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS CALL IN YOUR PLEDGE

2060
01:26:21,061 --> 01:26:23,063
AND AT THAT TIME TELL THE OPERATOR--

2061
01:26:23,063 --> 01:26:24,665
ONE OF OUR VOLUNTEERS--

2062
01:26:24,665 --> 01:26:26,667
WHAT TYPE OF PROGRAMMING YOU FEEL...

2063
01:26:28,669 --> 01:26:31,471
A QUICK BROILING PAN QUESTION...

2064
01:26:31,471 --> 01:26:33,073
YES, IT REALLY DOES COST THAT MUCH.

2065
01:26:33,073 --> 01:26:34,274
MAYBE NEXT TIME YOUR DUCK CAN PUKE

2066
01:26:34,675 --> 01:26:36,276
IN SOMETHING FROM POTTERY BARN.

2067
01:26:37,878 --> 01:26:39,479
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

2068
01:26:39,479 --> 01:26:41,882
I CANNOT MAKE THIS DECISION.

2069
01:26:42,282 --> 01:26:43,884
IT IS TOO DIFFICULT.

2070
01:26:43,884 --> 01:26:45,485
SO I'M JUST GOING TO LEAVE IT

2071
01:26:45,485 --> 01:26:47,087
ENTIRELY UP TO THE GODS OF FATE.

2072
01:26:47,087 --> 01:26:49,489

2073
01:26:49,489 --> 01:26:51,091
A MAGIC EIGHT BALL?

2074
01:26:51,091 --> 01:26:52,292
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

2075
01:26:52,292 --> 01:26:53,894
YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS DECISION WITH A TOY.

2076
01:26:53,894 --> 01:26:56,296
OH, IT'S NOT A TOY.

2077
01:26:57,497 --> 01:27:00,300
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

2078
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:01,902
I MEAN, I EITHER KEEP MY WIFE

2079
01:27:01,902 --> 01:27:04,705
AND LOSE ONE OF MY... MY BEST FRIENDS

2080
01:27:04,705 --> 01:27:07,107
OR I KEEP MY FRIEND AND GET DIVORCED

2081
01:27:07,107 --> 01:27:09,109
FOR THE SECOND TIME BEFORE I'M 30.

2082
01:27:09,109 --> 01:27:12,312
SO IF ANYONE ELSE HAS... HAS A BETTER SUGGESTION

2083
01:27:12,312 --> 01:27:15,115
LET'S HEAR IT, BECAUSE I I I GOT NOTHING.

2084
01:27:15,115 --> 01:27:15,916
DON'T BE SHY.

2085
01:27:16,316 --> 01:27:17,517
ANY SUGGESTION WILL DO.

2086
01:27:22,322 --> 01:27:23,924
OKAY, THEN.

2087
01:27:25,926 --> 01:27:28,729
HERE WE GO.

2088
01:27:28,729 --> 01:27:31,932
MAGIC EIGHT BALL--

2089
01:27:31,932 --> 01:27:35,135
SHOULD I NEVER SEE RACHEL AGAIN?

2090
01:27:38,338 --> 01:27:40,340
"ASK AGAIN LATER."

2091
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:42,342
LATER

2092
01:27:42,342 --> 01:27:45,145
IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

2093
01:27:50,751 --> 01:27:52,352
"ASK AGAIN LATER."

2094
01:27:52,352 --> 01:27:53,553
WHAT THE HELL!

2095
01:27:53,553 --> 01:27:54,755
THIS IS BROKEN!

2096
01:27:54,755 --> 01:27:55,956
THE GAME IS BROKEN!

2097
01:27:55,956 --> 01:27:58,358
ALL RIGHT, LET ME SEE.

2098
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,962
WILL CHANDLER HAVE SEX TONIGHT?

2099
01:28:03,563 --> 01:28:04,765
"DON'T COUNT ON IT."

2100
01:28:07,968 --> 01:28:10,771
SEEMS LIKE IT WORKS TO ME.

2101
01:28:11,972 --> 01:28:15,575
OKAY, ONE MORE TIME.

2102
01:28:15,575 --> 01:28:18,779
SHOULD I NEVER SEE RACHEL AGAIN?

2103
01:28:19,179 --> 01:28:20,380
HEY.

2104
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:21,982
OOH, MAGIC EIGHT BALL!

2105
01:28:21,982 --> 01:28:23,984
WHAT'D YOU ASK?

2106
01:28:26,787 --> 01:28:30,791
UH, DO, UH, DOES RACHEL GET TO PICK THE MOVIE

2107
01:28:30,791 --> 01:28:33,994
THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO SEE TONIGHT?

2108
01:28:33,994 --> 01:28:35,195
EXCELLENT. WHAT'S THE ANSWER?

2109
01:28:37,998 --> 01:28:39,199
WOO HOO!

2110
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:41,601
LOOKS LIKE STELLA'S GONNA GET HER GROOVE BACK TONIGHT.

2111
01:28:44,404 --> 01:28:46,406
WHAT? I HEARD IT WAS GOOD.

2112
01:28:48,008 --> 01:28:49,609

2113
01:28:49,609 --> 01:28:50,811
PBS TELETHON.

2114
01:28:51,211 --> 01:28:52,412
Hi, Joey.

2115
01:28:52,412 --> 01:28:54,014
HEY, PHEEBS.

2116
01:28:54,014 --> 01:28:55,615
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A PLEDGE.

2117
01:28:55,615 --> 01:28:58,018
I WOULD LIKE TO DONATE $200.

2118
01:28:58,018 --> 01:28:59,619
$200? YOU SURE, PHEEBS?

2119
01:28:59,619 --> 01:29:02,422
I MEAN, AFTER WHAT SESAME STREET DID TO YOU?

2120
01:29:02,422 --> 01:29:03,623
OH, I'M STILL MAD AT THEM

2121
01:29:04,024 --> 01:29:06,827
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THEY BRING HAPPINESS TO LOTS OF KIDS

2122
01:29:06,827 --> 01:29:08,829
WHOSE MOMS DIDN'T KILL THEMSELVES.

2123
01:29:08,829 --> 01:29:10,430
YOU KNOW, SO BY SUPPORTING THEM

2124
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:15,235
I'M DOING A GOOD THING, BUT I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.

2125
01:29:15,235 --> 01:29:18,438
SO, THERE, A SELFLESS GOOD DEED.

2126
01:29:18,438 --> 01:29:21,241
AND YOU DON'T FEEL A LITTLE GOOD ABOUT DONATING THE MONEY?

2127
01:29:21,241 --> 01:29:22,442
NO. IT SUCKS.

2128
01:29:22,442 --> 01:29:25,245
I WAS SAVING UP TO BUY A HAMSTER.

2129
01:29:25,245 --> 01:29:26,446
A HAMSTER?

2130
01:29:26,446 --> 01:29:28,048
THOSE THINGS ARE, LIKE, TEN BUCKS.

2131
01:29:28,048 --> 01:29:30,851
YEAH, NOT THE ONE I HAD MY EYE ON.

2132
01:29:30,851 --> 01:29:32,052
It looks like

2133
01:29:32,052 --> 01:29:34,855
we have surpassed last year's pledge total.

2134
01:29:34,855 --> 01:29:36,456
Thank you, viewers!

2135
01:29:36,456 --> 01:29:38,058
And the pledge that did it

2136
01:29:38,458 --> 01:29:42,863
was taken by one of our volunteers... Oh, boy

2137
01:29:42,863 --> 01:29:48,468
and may I say, one of our sharpest-dressed volunteers--

2138
01:29:48,468 --> 01:29:50,871
Mr. Joseph Tribbiani.

2139
01:29:50,871 --> 01:29:52,072
OH, LOOK!

2140
01:29:52,072 --> 01:29:53,273
LOOK! JOEY'S ON TV.

2141
01:29:53,273 --> 01:29:55,275
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

2142
01:29:55,275 --> 01:29:57,677
HEY, MY PLEDGE GOT JOEY ON TV.

2143
01:29:58,078 --> 01:30:00,881
OH, THAT MAKES ME FEEL SO... OH, NO!

2144
01:30:06,486 --> 01:30:10,490
LOOK, MAYBE I GOT CARRIED AWAY BEFORE

2145
01:30:10,490 --> 01:30:13,293
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING YOU GOT TO KNOW.

2146
01:30:13,293 --> 01:30:14,494
IF I'M THE BEST

2147
01:30:14,494 --> 01:30:18,098
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE YOU MADE ME THE BEST.

2148
01:30:19,299 --> 01:30:21,718
KEEP TALKING.

2149
01:30:21,718 --> 01:30:24,938
I MEAN, I WAS NOTHING BEFORE YOU.

2150
01:30:24,938 --> 01:30:27,340
CALL THE OTHER GIRLS AND ASK.

2151
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:29,743
WHICH WOULDN'T TAKE LONG.

2152
01:30:29,743 --> 01:30:33,346
BUT WHEN I'M WITH YOU, AND WE'RE TOGETHER

2153
01:30:33,346 --> 01:30:36,550
OH... MY... GOD.

2154
01:30:40,954 --> 01:30:42,155
REALLY?

2155
01:30:42,556 --> 01:30:45,358
OH... OH... MY... GOD.

2156
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:49,362
NOW, I UNDERSTAND IF YOU NEVER WANT

2157
01:30:49,362 --> 01:30:52,966
TO SLEEP WITH ME AGAIN, BUT THAT WOULD BE WRONG.

2158
01:30:52,966 --> 01:30:56,570
WE'RE TOO GOOD.

2159
01:30:56,570 --> 01:31:00,574
WE OWE IT TO SEX.

2160
01:31:00,574 --> 01:31:02,576
WELL, IF WE OWE IT...

2161
01:31:04,177 --> 01:31:05,378
OH!

2162
01:31:05,378 --> 01:31:07,380
OH, MY!

2163
01:31:08,982 --> 01:31:10,584
WHEN IS JOEY GOING TO BE HOME?

2164
01:31:10,584 --> 01:31:11,785
WELL, I WAS KIND OF HOPING

2165
01:31:11,785 --> 01:31:13,386
WE COULD DO THIS WITHOUT HIM.

2166
01:31:13,386 --> 01:31:14,588
HMM, YEAH.

2167
01:31:14,988 --> 01:31:16,189
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

2168
01:31:16,189 --> 01:31:17,791
LEAVE THE GLOVES ON.

2169
01:31:17,791 --> 01:31:19,793
BUT I JUST CLEANED THE BATHROOM.

2170
01:31:19,793 --> 01:31:21,795
YEAH, WHY DON'T WE LOSE THE GLOVES.

2171
01:31:21,795 --> 01:31:22,996
YEAH.

2172
01:31:22,996 --> 01:31:24,197
OKAY.

2173
01:31:24,197 --> 01:31:25,799
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

2174
01:31:26,199 --> 01:31:27,801
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SHOW THEM HOW IT'S DONE.

2175
01:31:27,801 --> 01:31:29,002
OKAY.

2176
01:31:29,002 --> 01:31:30,203
OW!

2177
01:31:30,203 --> 01:31:33,406
YOU KNOW THAT WASN'T PART OF IT.

2178
01:31:33,406 --> 01:31:34,608
I KNOW.

2179
01:31:34,608 --> 01:31:35,408
ALL RIGHT.

2180
01:31:41,815 --> 01:31:44,217

2181
01:31:48,622 --> 01:31:50,624
HI. YOU READY?

2182
01:31:50,624 --> 01:31:52,225
WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE.

2183
01:31:52,225 --> 01:31:53,426
FOR WHAT?

2184
01:31:53,426 --> 01:31:55,428
FOR STELLA, REMEMBER?

2185
01:31:55,428 --> 01:31:59,032
SHE'S GETTING HER GROOVE BACK IN, LIKE, 20 MINUTES.

2186
01:31:59,032 --> 01:32:02,636
YEAH, I, UH, TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

2187
01:32:02,636 --> 01:32:04,638
DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE A RAIN CHECK?

2188
01:32:04,638 --> 01:32:06,640
I'M WAITING FOR A CALL FROM EMILY.

2189
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:10,243
WELL... SURE, I GUESS.

2190
01:32:10,243 --> 01:32:14,264
HEY, I HEAR YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO LONDON. YAY.

2191
01:32:14,264 --> 01:32:15,932
IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

2192
01:32:15,932 --> 01:32:19,936
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF, UH... RELATIONSHIP STUFF.

2193
01:32:19,936 --> 01:32:21,604
LIKE WHAT?

2194
01:32:21,604 --> 01:32:23,039
JUST STUFF.

2195
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:28,044
YOU KNOW, UH, KIND OF WHAT EMILY WANTS.

2196
01:32:28,044 --> 01:32:30,046
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT IT.

2197
01:32:30,046 --> 01:32:31,648
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

2198
01:32:31,648 --> 01:32:34,851
NO. NO, YOU... YOU CAN'T HELP.

2199
01:32:34,851 --> 01:32:36,536
I MEAN...

2200
01:32:36,536 --> 01:32:40,140
I KIND OF HAVE TO DO THIS WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

2201
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:41,341
WELL, I...

2202
01:32:41,341 --> 01:32:44,894
I KNOW YOU CAN DO THAT, TOO.

2203
01:32:44,894 --> 01:32:50,016
I'M JUST SAYING, IF YOU NEED SOMEBODY TO TALK TO... HI.

2204
01:32:50,016 --> 01:32:52,018
THANKS.

2205
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:55,288
ROSS?

2206
01:32:56,890 --> 01:33:00,510
LOOK, WHATEVER THIS RELATIONSHIP STUFF IS THAT EMILY WANTS

2207
01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:01,711
JUST GIVE IT TO HER.

2208
01:33:01,711 --> 01:33:04,514
COME ON, THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT YOU LOVE HER.

2209
01:33:04,514 --> 01:33:06,933
SO JUST FIX WHATEVER SHE WANTS FIXED.

2210
01:33:06,933 --> 01:33:08,134
JUST DO IT.

2211
01:33:08,134 --> 01:33:08,935

2212
01:33:08,935 --> 01:33:12,238
I MEAN, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRY.

2213
01:33:12,238 --> 01:33:13,039

2214
01:33:13,490 --> 01:33:14,808
YOU'LL JUST HATE YOURSELF IF YOU DON'T.

2215
01:33:14,808 --> 01:33:16,476

2216
01:33:18,478 --> 01:33:20,080
OH, COME ON, ANSWER IT.

2217
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:21,681
IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

2218
01:33:21,681 --> 01:33:23,683
HELLO.

2219
01:33:23,683 --> 01:33:24,884
HI, SWEETIE.

LOOK, UM...

2222
01:33:29,873 --> 01:33:34,377
YES. I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT THING YOU...

2223
01:33:34,878 --> 01:33:37,881
YOU WANTED ME TO DO, AND, UH...

2224
01:33:37,881 --> 01:33:40,383

2225
01:33:42,836 --> 01:33:44,904
SO WILL YOU COME TO NEW YORK?

2226
01:33:46,906 --> 01:33:48,108

2227
01:34:26,279 --> 01:34:28,281

01:34:28,281 --> 01:34:29,883
NOPE.
