1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,504
OH, HEY, YOU GUYS, LOOK.

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,507
UGLY NAKED GUY'S PUTTING STUFF IN BOXES.

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,511
HUH... I'D SAY FROM THE LOOKS OF IT

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,513
OUR NAKED BUDDY IS MOVING.

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:17,517
IRONICALLY, MOST OF THE BOXES SEEM TO BE LABELED "CLOTHES."

6
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:21,021
AAH, I'M GOING TO MISS THAT BIG, OLD, SQUISHY BUTT.

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,524
AND WE'RE DONE WITH THE CHICKEN FRIED RICE.

8
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,525
HEY!

9
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,027
HEY, IF HE'S MOVING

10
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,029
MAYBE I SHOULD TRY TO GET HIS PLACE.

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,030
OH, GOOD IDEA. YES.

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,532
IT'LL BE SO COOL TO LIVE ACROSS FROM YOU GUYS.

13
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,535
YEAH, HEY, THEN WE COULD DO THAT TELEPHONE THING--

14
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,537
YOU KNOW, WELL, YOU HAVE A CAN

15
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,538
WE HAVE A CAN

16
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,540
AND IT'S CONNECTED BY A STRING.

17
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,544
OR WE COULD DO THE ACTUAL TELEPHONE THING.

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,047
UH OH. HE'S GOT PACKING TAPE STUCK

19
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,549
TO WHERE YOU REALLY DON'T WANT IT.

20
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,551
GET IT OFF, FAT MAN.

21
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,053
GET IT OFF!

22
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,056
OH, NO. HE'S TRYING TO PULL IT OFF SLOWLY.

23
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,557
TAKE IT FROM ME--

24
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,559
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE PULLING TAPE OFF YOURSELF

25
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,061
IT'S GOT TO BE IN ONE QUICK MOTION.

26
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,562
 OH!

27
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,564
LIKE THAT.

28
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:09,569

29
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:14,574
?  ?

30
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,077
?  ?

31
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,080
?  ?

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,584
?  ?

35
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,093
?  ?

36
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,095
?  ?

37
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,098
?  ?

38
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,100
?  ?

39
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,103
?  ?

40
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:49,109
?  ?

41
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,613
OH, MY GOD, I LOVE THIS APARTMENT.

42
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,115
ISN'T IT PERFECT?

43
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,117
I CAN'T BELIEVE I NEVER REALIZED

44
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,118
HOW HOW GREAT IT IS.

45
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,619
WELL, THAT IS BECAUSE

46
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,622
YOUR EYE IMMEDIATELY GOES TO THE BIG NAKED MAN.

47
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,623
 IT'S AMAZING.

48
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,125
YOU'D BETTER HURRY UP

49
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,128
AND FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, OR I'M GOING TO BEAT YOU TO IT.

50
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,629
OH.

51
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,634
WELL, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THIS

52
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,137
BUT I'M GOING TO GO USE UGLY NAKED GUY'S BATHROOM.

53
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,138
YEAH.

54
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,643
OH, LOOK, THERE'S MONICA AND CHANDLER.

55
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,145
HEY!

56
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,147
HEY, YOU GUYS! HEY!

57
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,153
AAH!

58
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,655
AAH! AAH!

59
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,656
WHAT?

60
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,658
AAH! CHANDLER AND MONICA!

61
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,160
CHANDLER AND MONICA!

62
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,661
OH, MY GOD! AAH!

63
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,163
CHANDLER AND MONICA!

64
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,664
OH, MY GOD! OH!

65
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,166
OH, MY EYES!

66
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,167
MY EYES!

67
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,168
OH, PHOEBE!

68
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,169
PHOEBE... OW!

69
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,170
OKAY! IT'S OKAY!

70
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,171
IT'S OKAY!

71
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,672
NO, THEY'RE DOING IT!

72
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,673
I KNOW! I KNOW!

73
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,674
YOU KNOW?!

74
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,176
YES, I KNOW AND JOEY KNOWS!

75
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,177
BUT ROSS DOESN'T KNOW!

76
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,678
SO YOU HAVE TO STOP SCREAMING!

77
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,180
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

78
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,181
OH! OH!

79
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,183

80
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,184
WHAT? WHAT?

81
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,186
NOTHING. OH, GOD, WE'RE JUST SO EXCITED

82
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,188
THAT YOU MIGHT GET THIS APARTMENT!

83
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,689
YEAH, IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD...

84
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,192
OH, MY GOD!

85
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,194
GET IN HERE!

86
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,695
COME ON!

87
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,698

88
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,204
YOU MEAN, WHENEVER MONICA AND CHANDLER

89
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,206
WERE, LIKE, YOU KNOW, "DOING LAUNDRY"

90
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,707
OR GOING "GROCERY SHOPPING..."

91
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,709
ALL THAT TIME MONICA SPENT ON THE PHONE

92
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,211
WITH "SAD LINDA FROM CAMP"?

93
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,712
DOING IT. DOING IT.

94
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,713
PHONE DOING IT.

95
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,714
OH!

96
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,216
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

97
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,717
I MEAN, I THINK IT'S GREAT...

98
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,219
FOR HIM.

99
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,221
SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO BETTER.

100
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,223
HEY, YOU GUYS.

101
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,224
JOEY, COME HERE!

102
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,725
PHOEBE JUST FOUND OUT

103
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,228
ABOUT MONICA AND CHANDLER.

104
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,730
YOU MEAN, HOW THEY'RE FRIENDS AND NOTHING MORE?

105
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,232
NO.

106
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,733
NO. JOEY, SHE KNOWS.

107
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,735
WE WERE AT UGLY NAKED GUY'S APARTMENT

108
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,737
AND WE SAW THEM DOING IT THROUGH THE WINDOW.

109
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,739
ACTUALLY, WE SAW THEM

110
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,242
DOING IT UP AGAINST THE WINDOW.

111
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,745
YOU KNOW, WE SAW THEM FORNICATING.

112
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,249
OKAY, SO NOW THEY KNOW YOU KNOW

113
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,251
AND THEY DON'T KNOW THAT RACHEL KNOWS?

114
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,253
YES, BUT... YOU KNOW WHAT?

115
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,755
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO KNOWS WHAT.

116
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,756
NOW ENOUGH OF US KNOW

117
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,259
THAT WE COULD JUST TELL THEM WE KNOW.

118
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,760
NOW ALL THE LYING AND THE SECRETS

119
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,262
WILL FINALLY BE OVER.

120
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,264
OR WE COULD NOT TELL THEM WE KNOW

121
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,266
AND HAVE A LITTLE FUN OF OUR OWN.

122
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,269
WH WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

123
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,771
EVERY TIME THAT THEY SAY THEY'RE DOING LAUNDRY

124
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,273
WE'LL JUST GIVE THEM A BUNCH

125
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,774
OF LAUNDRY TO DO.

126
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,276
OH... I I WOULD ENJOY THAT.

127
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,777
NO, NO, NO, NO, WAIT. WAIT.

128
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,779
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE EVEN MORE FUN?

129
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,780
TELLING THEM.

130
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,283
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE FUN.

131
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,285
NO. WELL, SO, WE'LL MAKE IT FUN.

132
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,286
WE'LL DO IT LIKE A...

133
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,288
LIKE A BARBERSHOP QUARTET.

134
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,289
? WE KNOW ?

135
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,290
? WE KNOW ?

136
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,292
? WE KNOW. ?

137
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:56,296
YEAH, NO. I WANT TO DO PHOEBE'S THING.

138
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,797
NO, BUT I CAN'T TAKE...

139
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,299
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.

140
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,301
JUST DON'T TELL THEM THAT WE KNOW.

141
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,303
NO.I CAN'T TAKE  ANY MORE SECRETS.

142
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,805
I GOT YOUR SECRETS. I GOT THEIR SECRETS.

143
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,308
I GOT SECRETS OF MY OWN, YOU KNOW?

144
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,310
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SECRETS.

145
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,311
OH, YEAH?

146
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,313
WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT HUGGSY--

147
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,315
MY BEDTIME PENGUIN PAL.

148
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,319
SO... UM....

149
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,322
HOW HOW ARE WE GOING TO MESS WITH THEM?

150
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,324

151
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,825
WELL, YOU COULD USE YOUR POSITION

152
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,828
YOU KNOW, AS THE ROOMMATE, AND THEN I WOULD USE

153
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,331
YOU KNOW, THE STRONGEST TOOL AT MY DISPOSAL--

154
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,333
MY SEXUALITY.

155
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,834
HELLO, CHILDREN.

156
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,336
HEY. HEY. HEY.

157
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,838
OKAY, WATCH... LEARN... AND DON'T EAT MY COOKIE.

158
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,842
HEY.

159
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,843
HEY.

160
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,346
OOH, WOW, THAT JACKET LOOKS GREAT ON YOU.

161
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,347
REALLY?

162
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,349
YEAH. THE MATERIAL LOOKS SO SOFT...

163
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,351
OH, HELLO, MR. BICEP.

164
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,854
HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING OUT?

165
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,358
WELL, I TRY TO YOU KNOW, SQUEEZE THINGS.

166
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:02,362

167
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,364
ARE YOU OKAY?

168
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,866
WELL, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW...

169
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,868
I, OH, I CAN'T TELL YOU THIS.

170
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,871
PHOEBE, IT'S ME-- YOU CAN TELL ME ANYTHING.

171
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,873
WELL, ACTUALLY, YOU'RE THE ONE PERSON

172
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,375
I CAN'T TELL THIS TO

173
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,877
AND THE ONE PERSON I WANT TO THE MOST.

174
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,881
WHAT'S GOING ON?

175
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,385
I THINK IT'S JUST THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN WITH A GUY IN SO LONG

176
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,887
AND YOU KNOW HOW SOMETIMES YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING

177
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,890
AND YOU JUST DON'T EVEN SEE THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE

178
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,892
IN FRONT OF YOU SIPPING COFFEE...

179
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,896
OH, NO, HAVE I SAID TOO MUCH?

180
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,899
WELL, JUST SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT...

181
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,401
I KNOW I WILL.

182
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,904
OOH...

183
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,915
YOU ARE SO CUTE.

184
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,917
HOW DID YOU GET TO BE SO CUTE?

185
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,419
WELL

186
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,920
MY GRANDFATHER WAS SWEDISH...

187
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,423
AND MY GRANDMOTHER WAS, ACTUALLY

188
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,424
A TINY, LITTLE BUNNY.

189
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,927
NOW YOU'RE EVEN CUTER.

190
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,931
YOU KNOW, THAT IS A POPULAR OPINION TODAY

191
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,932
I MUST SAY.

192
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,933
WHAT?

193
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,936
THE WEIRDEST THING HAPPENED AT THE COFFEE HOUSE.

194
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,438
I THINK PHOEBE WAS HITTING ON ME.

195
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,441
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

196
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,943
I'M TELLING YOU, I THINK PHOEBE

197
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,446
THINKS I'M FOXY.

198
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,448
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

199
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,450
OW.

200
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,454
I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST...

201
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,456
I MEAN, PHOEBE HAS JUST ALWAYS THOUGHT

202
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,958
YOU WERE CHARMING IN A SEXLESS KIND OF WAY.

203
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,461
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW, I I CAN'T HEAR THAT ENOUGH.

204
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,462
I I'M SORRY.

205
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,465
I JUST THINK THAT YOU MISUNDERSTOOD HER.

206
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,467
NO. I DIDN'T MISUNDERSTAND, OKAY?

207
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,468
SHE WAS ALL OVER ME.

208
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,970
SHE TOUCHED MY BICEP, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

209
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,472
THIS BICEP?

210
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,475
WELL, IT'S NOT FLEXED RIGHT NOW.

211
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,979
WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR YOU TO BELIEVE

212
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,482
THAT PHOEBE COULD BE ATTRACTED TO ME?

213
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,484
IT'S NOT.

214
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,487
ALL THE GIRLS ARE ATTRACTED TO YOU.

215
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,490
YOU'RE PART BUNNY.

216
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,994
HEY, MON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

217
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,497
YOU WANT TO COME SEE A MOVIE WITH US?

218
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,998
UH... YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY

219
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,501
I I WAS GOING TO DO SOME LAUNDRY.

220
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,003
HEY, CHANDLER

221
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,505
YOU WANT TO DO IT WITH ME?

222
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,507
SURE, I'LL... DO IT WITH YOU. OKAY.

223
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,511
OKAY, GREAT. HOLD ON A SEC.

224
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,014
OH... HERE YOU GO.

225
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,016
YOU DON'T MIND, DO YOU?

226
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,519
THAT WOULD REALLY HELP ME OUT A LOT. THANKS.

227
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,020
YOU KNOW WHAT?

228
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,523
I I DON'T THINK I HAVE ENOUGH QUARTERS.

229
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,024
OH, I HAVE QUARTERS.

230
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,025
OH!

231
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,531
GREAT, NOW WE CAN DO LAUNDRY ALL NIGHT.

232
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,532
ALL NIGHT LAUNDRY!

233
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,034
HEY.

234
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,035
HEY, ROSS

235
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,037
ANY WORD ON THE APARTMENT YET?

236
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,539
I CALLED OVER THERE

237
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,541
AND UGLY NAKED GUY IS SUBLETTING IT HIMSELF

238
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,043
AND HE'S ALREADY HAD LIKE 100 APPLICANTS.

239
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,044
OH. OH, MAN.

240
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,046
NO, NO, IT'S OKAY, BECAUSE YOU KNOW

241
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,049
WHAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND ME IS?

242
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,552
YOUR HISTORY OF BEDWETTING?

243
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,554
HEY, I TRUSTED YOU, MAN!

244
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,559
ANYWAY, THE DIFFERENCE IS, I'VE GOT THE EDGE.

245
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,062
IT'S NOT EXACTLY ETHICAL, BUT I SENT OVER A LITTLE BRIBE

246
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,565
TO TIP THE SCALES IN MY DIRECTION.

247
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,067
CHECK IT OUT. YOU CAN PROBABLY SEE IT

248
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,069
FROM THE WINDOW.

249
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,071
OH, IS IT THAT PINBALL MACHINE

250
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,073
WITH THE BIG BOW ON IT?

251
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,075
NO.

252
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,077
THAT NEW MOUNTAIN BIKE?

253
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,079
NO.

254
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,082
WELL, WHAT DID YOU SEND?

255
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,085
A BASKET OF MINI MUFFINS.

256
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,589
BUT THERE'S A WHOLE TABLE OF MINI MUFFIN BASKETS

257
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,090
WHICH ONE DID YOU SEND?

258
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,593
THE SMALL ONE.

259
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,095
WHAT? YOU YOU ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT BASKET

260
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,097
WAS GOING TO GET YOU THE APARTMENT?

261
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,098
WELL...YEAH.

262
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,100
SOMEONE SENT US A BASKET AT WORK ONCE

263
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,103
AND PEOPLE WENT CRAZY OVER THOSE LITTLE MUFFINS.

264
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,105
IT WAS THE BEST DAY.

265
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,608
YOUR WORK MAKES ME SAD.

266
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,609

267
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,612
OH, MAN... I WANT THAT PLACE SO MUCH...

268
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,615
AND I WAS SO SURE THAT WAS GOING TO WORK.

269
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,619
THERE'S 12 BUCKS I'LL NEVER SEE AGAIN.

270
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,620
ALL RIGHT, WE'D BETTER GO

271
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,622
IF WE'RE GOING TO CATCH THAT MOVIE.

272
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,623
BYE.

273
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,124
BYE.

274
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,125
BYE, CHANDLER.

275
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,127
I MISS YOU ALREADY.

276
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,132
DID YOU SEE THAT?

277
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,135
WITH THE INAPPROPRIATE AND THE PINCHING?

278
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,136
ACTUALLY, I DID.

279
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,638
OKAY, SO NOW DO YOU BELIEVE

280
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,139
THAT SHE'S ATTRACTED TO ME?

281
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,142
OH, MY GOD...

282
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,144
OH, MY GOD, SHE KNOWS ABOUT US!

283
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,145
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

284
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,148
PHOEBE KNOWS, AND SHE'S JUST TRYING TO FREAK US OUT.

285
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,651
THAT'S THE ONLY EXPLANATION FOR IT.

286
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,156
OKAY, BUT WHAT ABOUT MY PINCHABLE BUTT

287
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,158
AND MY BULGING BICEPS?

288
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,660
SHE KNOWS!

289
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,167
JOEY!

290
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,670
YEAH?!

291
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,173
PHOEBE KNOWS ABOUT US.

292
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,675
WELL, I DIDN'T TELL THEM.

293
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,176
"THEM"?

294
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,178
WHO'S "THEM"?

295
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,682
UH... PHOEBE AND JOEY.

296
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,685
JOEY.

297
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,687
AND RACHEL.

298
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,688
I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU

299
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,189
BUT THEY MADE ME PROMISE NOT TO TELL.

300
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,190
OH, MAN!

301
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,693
I'M SORRY, BUT, HEY, IT'S OVER NOW, RIGHT?

302
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,195
BECAUSE YOU CAN TELL THEM YOU KNOW THEY KNOW

303
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,698
AND I CAN GO BACK TO KNOWING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

304
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,701
UNLESS...

305
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,202
NO, NOT UNLESS.

306
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,704
THIS MUST END NOW!

307
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,206
OH, MAN, THEY THINK THEY ARE SO SLICK

308
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,207
MESSING WITH US.

309
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,710
BUT SEE, THEY DON'T KNOW THAT WE KNOW

310
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,711
THAT THEY KNOW.

311
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,213
SO...

312
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,214
AH, YES.

313
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,718
THE MESSERS BECOME THE MESSEES!

314
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,720
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

315
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,222
THINK OF HOW MUCH FUN IT WOULD BE TO TELL.

316
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,223
? WE KNOW ?

317
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,224
? WE KNOW ?

318
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,225
? WE KNOW. ?

319
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,229
WHAT?

320
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,232
OH! TSK. THAT WASN'T YOU.

321
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,737

322
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,239
OH, ROSS, HONEY, YOU GOT TO STOP TORTURING YOURSELF.

323
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,241
WHY DON'T YOU JUST FIND ANOTHER APARTMENT?

324
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,743
I'VE ALREADY LOOKED AT, LIKE

325
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,745
A THOUSAND APARTMENTS THIS MONTH

326
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,247
AND NONE OF THEM EVEN COMPARES TO THAT ONE.

327
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,749
WELL, EXCEPT FOR ONE

328
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,252
BUT I WOULD'VE HAD TO SHARE IT WITH ARMENIAN FAMILY.

329
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,755
GRANDMA REALLY LIKED ME.

330
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,258
BUT I WANT UGLY NAKED APARTMENT.

331
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,260
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?

332
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,763
YOU SHOULD FIND OUT WHAT HIS HOBBIES ARE

333
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,765
AND THEN USE THAT TO BOND WITH HIM.

334
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,267
YEAH. LIKE IF I WANTED SOMETHING FROM JOEY

335
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,769
I WOULD STRIKE UP A CONVERSATION

336
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,271
ABOUT, SAY, UM, SANDWICHES...

337
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,275
OR, UH, OR MY UNDERWEAR.

338
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,777
I'M LISTENING.

339
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,280
SEE?

340
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,282
THAT IS A GREAT IDEA.

341
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:08,287
AND I KNOW UGLY NAKED GUY BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WATCHING HIM

342
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:12,291
FOR, LIKE, FIVE YEARS, SO THAT GIVES ME BACK MY EDGE.

343
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,793
LET'S SEE NOW.

344
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,795
HE HAD THE TRAMPOLINE.

345
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,796
HE BROKE THAT.

346
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,798
WELL, HE HAD GRAVITY BOOTS.

347
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,800
YEAH, HE BROKE THOSE, TOO.

348
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,305
SO HE LIKES TO BREAK STUFF.

349
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,807
OKAY, I'VE GOT TO GO PICK UP BEN

350
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,809
BUT I WILL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

351
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,311
HEY, DIDN'T HE USED TO HAVE A CAT?

352
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,813
I WOULDN'T BRING THAT UP.

353
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,314
IT WOULD PROBABLY JUST BUM HIM OUT.

354
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,317
POOR CAT NEVER SAW THAT BIG BUTT COMING.

355
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,820

356
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,822
HELLO.

357
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,324
OH, YEAH. HEY, HOLD ON A SECOND.

358
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,826
SHE'S RIGHT HERE.

359
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,827
IT'S CHANDLER.

360
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,329
OH?

361
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,332
HELLO, YOU.

362
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,335
HELLO, PHOEBE, I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU ALL DAY.

363
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,337
HUH?

364
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,338
WELL, YOU KNOW

365
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,840
THAT THING YOU SAID BEFORE.

366
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,342
I'D BE LYING IF I SAID I WASN'T INTRIGUED.

367
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,343
REALLY?

368
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,845
Yeah, listen

369
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,847
JOEY'S NOT GOING TO BE HERE TONIGHT

370
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,348
SO WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER

371
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,350
AND I'LL LET YOU FEEL MY BICEP.

372
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,352
OR MAYBE MORE.

373
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,856
I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT.

374
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,857
OKAY, BYE.

375
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,861
OH, MY GOD. HE WANTS ME TO COME OVER

376
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,863
AND FEEL HIS BICEP AND MORE.

377
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,364
ARE YOU KIDDING?

378
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,866
NO.

379
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,869
I CANNOT BELIEVE HE WOULD DO THAT TO MON...

380
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,371
WA...

381
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,379
JOEY, DO THEY KNOW THAT WE KNOW?

382
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,380
NO.

383
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,882
JOEY?

384
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,883
THEY KNOW YOU KNOW.

385
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,386
OH! I KNEW IT!

386
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,889
I WOULD SAY, "THANK GOD, EVERYBODY KNOWS.

387
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,893
IT'S FINALLY OVER, "BUT THAT HASN'T BEEN WORKING FOR ME.

388
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,895
OH! I CANNOT BELIEVE THOSE TWO!

389
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,398
THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD MESS WITH US.

390
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,400
THEY'RE TRYING TO MESS WITH US?!

391
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,904
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT WE KNOW THEY KNOW WE KNOW.

392
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,408
AND, JOEY, YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING.

393
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,410
I COULDN'T IF I WANTED TO.

394
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:18,918
GOOD EVENING, SIR.

395
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,419

00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,922
I'M ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO APPLIED FOR THE APARTMENT

397
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,924
AND I REALIZE THAT

398
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,927
THE COMPETITION IS FIERCE, BUT...

399
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,929
I'M SORRY.

400
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:36,936

00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,441

00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,447
THAT IS HOW GOD INTENDED IT.

405
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,951
LOOK AT THEM.

406
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,952
THEY'RE PANICKED.

00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,954
OH, YEAH. THEY'LL TOTALLY BACK DOWN.

408
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,955

410
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,458
IF HE WANTS A DATE, HE'S GOING TO GET A DATE.

411
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,960
ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING TO GO IN.

00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,470

417
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,484
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

418
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,485
SHOULD WE SAY AROUND 7:00?

419
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,989
YES.

420
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:30,990
GOOD.

421
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,491
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD

422
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,994
TO YOU AND ME HAVING SEXUAL INTERCOURSE.

423
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,000

00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,552
ALL RIGHT, THANKS, BUT, UM... GLASSES

438
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,055
THAT DO NOT HAVE HANDLES AND THAT ARE GLASS.

439
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,556
AND, UM...

440
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,059
WINE THAT IS NOT OLIVE OIL.

441
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,561
ALL RIGHT, IT'LL BE GREAT.

442
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,064
JUST MAKE HER THINK YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH HER.

443
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,565
IT'LL TOTALLY FREAK HER OUT.

444
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,069
OKAY, LISTEN, HOW FAR AM I GOING TO HAVE TO GO WITH HER?

445
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,071
RELAX. SHE'S GOING TO GIVE IN WAY BEFORE YOU DO.

446
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,072
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

447
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,074
BECAUSE YOU'RE ON MY TEAM

448
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,575
AND MY TEAM ALWAYS WINS.

449
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:00,079

00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,081

00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,082

00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,087
OKAY, HONEY. NOW, I'M GOING TO TRY TO LISTEN FROM RIGHT HERE.

453
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,088
OKAY. OKAY?

454
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,089
OH, WAIT.

455
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,090
GOOD IDEA.

456
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,091
YEAH. OH, WAIT.

457
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,592
DON'T GIVE AWAY THE FARM.

00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,593
OKAY.

459
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,599
PHOEBE.

00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,102
CHANDLER.

00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,603
COME ON IN.

462
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,606
I WAS GOING TO.

463
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,111
UM, I BROUGHT SOME WINE.

464
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,612
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME?

465
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,613
SURE.

466
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,619
OH.

467
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,622
SO, HERE WE ARE.

468
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,124
NERVOUS?

469
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,625
ME? NO. YOU?

470
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,128
NO. I WANT THIS TO HAPPEN.

471
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,131
SO DO I.

472
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,633

473
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:09,148
I'M GOING TO PUT ON SOME MUSIC.

474
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:15,154

475
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,156
JOEY LIKES TO SCARE THE DUCK.

476
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,162
MAYBE I'LL DANCE FOR YOU.

477
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,667

478
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,682
YOU LOOK GOOD.

479
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,186
THANKS.

480
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,689
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU SAY THINGS LIKE THAT

481
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,191
IT MAKES ME WANT

482
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,194
TO RIP THAT SWEATER VEST RIGHT OFF.

483
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:59,198
WELL, WHY DON'T WE MOVE THIS INTO THE BEDROOM?

484
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,199
REALLY?

485
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,201
OH, DO YOU NOT WANT TO?

486
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,702
NO, NO.

487
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,703
I JUST, YOU KNOW

488
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,206
FIRST, I WANT TO TAKE OFF ALL MY CLOTHES

489
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,709
AND HAVE YOU RUB LOTION ON ME.

490
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:15,714
WELL, THAT WOULD BE NICE.

491
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,217
I'LL GO GET THE LOTION.

492
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,722
THIS IS TOTALLY GETTING OUT OF HAND, OKAY?

493
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,724
SHE WANTS ME TO PUT LOTION ON HER!

494
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,725
SHE'S BLUFFING!

495
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,727
LOOK, SHE'S NOT BACKING DOWN.

496
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,730
SHE WENT LIKE THIS:

497
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,732
H H HE'S NOT BACKING DOWN.

498
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,234
HE WENT TO GET LOTION.

499
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,736
PHOEBE, IT'S CHANDLER. YOU CAN TAKE HIM.

500
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,738
I MEAN, COME ON, DON'T YOU REMEMBER

501
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,241
WHEN YOU MADE HIM CRY USING ONLY YOUR WORDS?

502
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,242

503
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,745
OH, MAN, AREN'T YOU GUYS DONE YET?

504
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,748
I WANT TO SIT IN MY CHAIR.

505
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,749
JUST LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.

506
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,251
THE SOONER PHOEBE BREAKS CHANDLER

507
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,753
THE SOONER THIS IS ALL OVER AND OUT IN THE OPEN.

508
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,755
OOH, I LIKE THAT.

509
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,258
OH, OKAY, SHOW HIM YOUR BRA.

510
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,759
HE'S AFRAID OF BRAS.

511
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,760
CAN'T WORK THEM.

512
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,762
JOEY!

513
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,769
WOW, YOU DIDN'T RIP OFF ANY BUTTONS.

514
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,772
NOT MY FIRST TIME.

515
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,775
YOU GO BACK OUT THERE

516
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,278
AND YOU SEDUCE HER TILL SHE CRACKS.

517
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,279
OKAY. GIVE ME A SECOND.

518
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,282
DID YOU CLEAN UP IN HERE?

519
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,283
OF COURSE.

520
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,290
OH, YOU'RE GOING?

521
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,792
NOT WITHOUT YOU, LOVER.

522
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,800
SO, THIS IS MY BRA.

523
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,806
IT'S VERY, VERY NICE.

524
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,311
WELL, COME HERE.

525
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,314
I'M VERY HAPPY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ALL THE SEX.

526
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,816
YOU SHOULD BE.

527
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,319
I'M VERY BENDY.

528
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,325
I'M GOING TO KISS YOU NOW.

529
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,827
NOT IF I KISS YOU FIRST.

530
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,850
WELL, I GUESS THERE'S NOTHING LEFT FOR US TO DO BUT KISS.

531
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,353
HERE IT COMES.

532
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,855
OUR FIRST KISS.

533
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,366
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!

534
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,367
FINE! YOU WIN!

535
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,368
I CAN'T HAVE

536
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,869
SEX WITH YOU.

537
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,370
AND WHY NOT?

538
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,871
BECAUSE I'M IN LOVE WITH MONICA.

539
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,373
YOU YOU'RE WHAT?

540
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,376

I LOVE HER!

543
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,388
I LOVE YOU, MONICA.

00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,390
I LOVE YOU, TOO, CHANDLER.

545
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,397
I JUST... I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE DOING IT.

546
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,399
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE IN LOVE.

547
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,903
DUDE!

548
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,406
AND HATS OFF TO PHOEBE.

549
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,907
QUITE A COMPETITOR.

00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,909
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

551
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,412

ALL RIGHT.

554
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,416
SO, THAT'S IT.

555
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,417
IT'S OVER.

556
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,418
EVERYBODY KNOWS.

557
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,919
WELL, ACTUALLY, ROSS DOESN'T.

558
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,922
YES, AND WE'D APPRECIATE IT IF NO ONE TOLD HIM YET.

559
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,433
WELL, HERE IT IS: A NEW PLACE FOR A NEW ROSS.

560
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,936
I'M GOING TO HAVE YOU AND ALL THE GUYS FROM WORK OVER

561
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,938
ONCE IT'S, YOU KNOW, FURNISHED.

562
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,441
I MUST SAY, IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU BACK ON YOUR FEET.

563
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,942
WELL, I AM THAT.

564
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,445
AND THAT WHOLE RAGE THING IS DEFINITELY BEHIND ME.

565
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,946
I WONDER IF IT'S TIME FOR YOU

566
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,948
TO REJOIN OUR TEAM AT THE MUSEUM.

567
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,950
OH, DONALD, THAT, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

568
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,453
I AM TOTALLY READY TO COME BACK TO WORK.

569
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,454
I...

570
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,955
WHAT?

571
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,957
NO.

572
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,959
WHA...

573
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,462
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

574
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,465
GET OFF MY SISTER!
