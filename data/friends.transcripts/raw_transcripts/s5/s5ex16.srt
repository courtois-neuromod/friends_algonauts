00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,158
YOU GUYS SHOULD PROBABLY KEEP TALKING.

54
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,659
THIS COULD TAKE AWHILE.

55
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,661
OH, NO, WAIT! LOOK IT!

56
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,163
WHOA!

57
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,164
OH, MY GOD.

00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,165
THIS IS A POLICE BADGE.

59
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,166
OH, THAT'S SO COOL.

60
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,168
WHY WOULD A COP COME IN HERE, THOUGH?

61
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,669
THEY DON'T SERVE DOUGHNUTS.

62
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,672
YOU KNOW WHAT, ACTUALLY?

63
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,174
COULD YOU DISCOVER THE BADGE AGAIN?

64
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,675
I THINK I CAN COME UP WITH SOMETHING BETTER THAN THAT.

65
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,177
PHOEBE

66
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,179
I BET SOMEBODY'S MISSING THAT BADGE.

67
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,680
YEAH. I SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE IT BACK.

68
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,681
OOH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

69
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,183
WHILE I'M AT THE POLICE STATION

70
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,684
I COULD CHECK THEIR TEN MOST WANTED LIST.

71
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,687
BECAUSE MY FRIEND FRITZY'S BEEN NUMBER 11 FOR, LIKE, EVER

72
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,688

73
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,691
HEY, YOU GUYS.

74
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:12,692
HEY, JOEY.

75
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:13,693
HEY.

76
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,695
HI.

00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,198

78
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,199
OH, YES, IT IS.

79
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,700
I'M SORRY. I BORROWED IT.

80
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,202
I WAS COLD. I I HOPE IT'S OKAY.

81
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,204
UH, WELL, IT'S JUST THAT, UH...

82
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,706
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE WEARING SOMEONE'S SWEATSHIRT

83
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,208
SHOULDN'T IT BE YOUR BOYFRIEND'S?

84
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,709
AND I'M NOT HIM.

85
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,712
I'M SORRY. I'LL GIVE IT BACK TO YOU.

86
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,713
NO, NO.

87
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,215
NO. IT'S GOING TO BE

88
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,716
ALL SMELLING LIKE MONICA.

89
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,219
ARE YOU SAYING I SMELL BAD?

90
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,722
NO, NO. YOU SMELL LIKE A MEADOW.

91
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,226
I'M SORRY. I...

92
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,230
WHAT'S WITH HIM?

93
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,231
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

94
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,733
THE LAST TIME THAT JOEY WENT TO A MEADOW

95
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,236
HIS MOTHER WAS SHOT BY A HUNTER.

96
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,238
HEY.

97
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,739
HEY, LOOK IT! LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

98
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,241
IT'S A POLICE BADGE.

99
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,742
WHAT'S THAT DOING HERE?

100
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,744
I DON'T SEE ANY DOUGHNUTS.

101
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,249
COPS AND DOUGHNUTS? COME ON.

102
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,750
OH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

103
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,252
IF CHANDLER HAD SAID IT, YOU'D ALL BE ON THE FLOOR.

104
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,754
COPS? DOUGHNUTS? ME?

105
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,770
OH!

106
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,774
YEAH, I STILL DON'T KNOW.

107
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,777
I'M SORRY. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I BOUGHT THE RIGHT COUCH.

108
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,279
I NEED A COUCH THAT SAYS

109
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,281
"KIDS WELCOME HERE"

110
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,783
BUT THAT ALSO SAYS...

111
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,286
"COME HERE TO ME."

112
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,289
WHAT?

113
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,791
YOU SAY THAT TO KIDS?

114
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,293
NO, NO, NO.

115
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,295
THE "COME HERE TO ME" IS...

116
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,297
YOU KNOW, FOR THE LADIES.

117
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,300
ROSS, HONEY, IT'S A NICE COUCH.

118
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,801
IT'S NOT A MAGIC COUCH.

119
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,305
YOU PICKED A GREAT COUCH.

120
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,306
YEAH?

121
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,308
YEAH. COULD YOU JUST SIGN RIGHT HERE, PLEASE?

122
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,809
OH, SURE. WHOA, WHOA. WHAT'S...?

123
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,313
THE DELIVERY CHARGE IS ALMOST AS MUCH AS THE COUCH.

124
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,814
WAIT, NO. THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

125
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,816
COME ON, HE LIVES THREE BLOCKS AWAY.

126
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,817
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

127
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,819
I'LL TAKE IT MYSELF, THANK YOU.

128
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,321
ALL RIGHT, RACH, COME ON. LET'S GO.

129
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,323
YEAH.

130
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,828

131
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,331
ARE YOU KIDDING?

132
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,832
NO, COME ON. IT'S ONLY THREE BLOCKS.

133
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,334
IT'S NOT VERY HEAVY.

134
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,335
TRY IT. COME ON.

135
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,337

136
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,841
OH! OH, I CAN DO IT.

137
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,842
YEAH.

138
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,344
YOU TWO WILL REALLY ENJOY THAT COUCH.

139
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,346
OH, YEAH, WE'RE, UH...

140
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,847
YEAH, WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

141
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,849
OH. OKAY.

142
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,850

143
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,852
SOMETHING DIDN'T QUITE ADD UP THERE.

144
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,359
ROSS...

145
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,860
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

146
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,362
ROSS...

147
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,864
WELL, YOU... HER...

148
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,866
I MEAN, SHE'S VERY...

149
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,368
YOU KNOW...

150
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,370
AND YOU'RE, LIKE...

151
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,871
YOU KNOW...

152
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:18,378
NOT THAT IT'S ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS, BUT WE DID GO OUT.

153
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,879
REALLY? YOU TWO?

154
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,880
YEAH. RACH?

155
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,383
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO BE DOING THIS RIGHT NOW.

156
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,884
I'M CARRYING A VERY HEAVY COUCH.

157
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,387
THEN TELL HIM QUICKLY.

158
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,889
FINE. WE WENT OUT.

159
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,392
NOT ONLY DID WE GO OUT.

160
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,395
WE DID IT... 298 TIMES.

161
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,397
ROSS!

162
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,399
OH, MY...

163
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,401
OH! YOU KEPT COUNT?!

164
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,403
YOU ARE SUCH A LOSER.

165
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:48,408
A LOSER YOU DID IT WITH 298 TIMES!

166
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,913
OH! OH!

167
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,415
MA'AM! EXCUSE ME, MA'AM?

168
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,416
YES?

169
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,918
YOU CAN'T PUT YOUR CIGARETTE OUT ON A TREE.

170
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,920
YEAH, I CAN. IT WORKED REAL WELL.

171
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,922
NO, BUT YOU SHOULDN'T.

172
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,924
SO DON'T EVER DO THAT AGAIN.

173
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,426
I WON'T...

174
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,428
TILL I HAVE MY NEXT CIGARETTE.

175
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,929
HOLD IT.

176
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,931
N.Y.P.D. FREEZE, PUNK.

177
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,433
WHAT?

178
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,934
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

179
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,436
YOU ARE SO BUSTED.

180
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,437

181
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,438
UH, BOOK THEM.

182
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,441
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

183
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,443
SAVE IT, RED!

184
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,945
UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN THE SLAMMER

185
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,447
YOU'LL APOLOGIZE TO THE TREE.

186
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,450
I AM NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE TO A TREE.

187
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,952
YOU APOLOGIZE TO THE TREE RIGHT NOW

188
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,954
OR I AM CALLING FOR BACKUP.

189
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,458
BACKUP! BACKUP!

190
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,460
I I'M SORRY! SORRY!

191
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,461
OKAY, CANCEL BACKUP!

192
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,963
CANCEL BACKUP!

193
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,466
OKAY.

194
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,967
ROSS, DIDN'T YOU SAY

195
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,969
THAT THERE WAS  AN ELEVATOR IN HERE?

196
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,472
UH, YES, I DID, BUT THERE ISN'T. OKAY.

197
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,974
WELL, THEN, WAIT. DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD

198
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,976
MAYBE RETHINK THE WHOLE HIRING MOVERS THING?

199
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,978
NO WAY! THEY'RE A RIP OFF.

200
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,979
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

201
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,481
THEY CHECK OUT YOUR STUFF

202
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,483
AND COME BACK LATER AND STEAL IT.

203
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,485
IT'S TRUE. I SAW IT ON DATE LINE.

204
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,986
OH, I LOVE DATELINE.

205
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,489
JANE PAULEY IS THE ONE WOMAN I WOULD KISS.

206
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,990
OW. I DON'T KN

207
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,492
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT HER.

208
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,494
RACH, CAN WE CONCENTRATE.

209
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,496
YEAH. FINE.

210
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,998
I LISTENED TO YOUR DUMB STORY.

211
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,000
OKAY, GO LEFT. LEFT.

212
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,502
OKAY.

213
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,503
LEFT!

214
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,004
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

215
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,006
THERE'S NO MORE LEFT LEFT.

216
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,007
OH, OKAY.

217
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,009
YOU KNOW, LIFT IT STRAIGHT UP OVER YOUR HEAD.

218
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,511
STRAIGHT UP OVER YOUR HEAD.

219
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,512
YOU CAN DO IT.

220
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,513
YOU CAN DO IT.

221
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,514

222
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,515
OKAY. YOU GOT IT?

223
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,016
GO. YEAH. GO.

224
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,018
OKAY, YOU GOT IT, RIGHT? YOU GOT IT, RIGHT?

225
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,019
RIGHT. YEAH.

226
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,020

227
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,027
ANY CHANCE YOU THINK THE COUCH LOOKS GOOD THERE?

228
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,531
SO THIS GUY WAS ALL...

229
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,532

230
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,534
AND I'M ALL, "BUFFAY-- HOMICIDE."

231
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,037
IT WAS JUST SO COOL.

232
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,540
PHOEBE, YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO TAKE THAT BACK.

233
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,543
I KNOW, BUT I'M HAVING SO MUCH FUN DOING GOOD DEEDS.

234
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,045
OKAY, BUT IMPERSONATING A POLICE OFFICER'S A SERIOUS THING.

235
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,547
YOU COULD GET ARRESTED.

236
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,049
YOU COULD GET ARRESTED RIGHT NOW!

237
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,554
ALL RIGHT, YEAH, I BETTER TAKE IT BACK.

238
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,556
I'M TOTALLY DRUNK WITH POWER.

239
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,560
HEY.

240
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,061
HEY.

241
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,563
OH, I...

242
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,566
HI, JOE.

243
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,567
YEAH... I DIDN'T KNOW YOU GUYS

244
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,068
WERE GOING TO BE HERE.

245
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,069
HEY, JOEY?

246
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,071
DO ME A FAVOR, SWEETIE. TASTE THIS.

247
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,573
WHAT? WHY?

248
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,574
IT'S OKAY, JOE.

249
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,576
SHE'S A TRAINED CHEF.

250
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,079
UH... ACTUALLY, I  WAS LOOKING FOR PHOEBE.

251
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,583
YOU JUST MISSED HER.

252
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,585
OH, WAS THAT HER?

253
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,085
UH HUH.

254
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,587
OH. I GOT TO GO.

255
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,088
JOEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

256
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,089
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU?

257
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,591
NOTHING.

258
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,593
OH, COME ON, YOU'VE BEEN ACTING STRANGE ALL DAY.

259
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,094
ALL RIGHT.

260
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,596
THERE IS SOMETHING.

261
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,097
I, UH...

262
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,600
I KIND OF HAD A DREAM...

263
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,101
BUT I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

264
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,603
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

265
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,105
WHAT IF MARTIN LUTHER KING HAD SAID THAT?

266
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,610
I... KIND OF HAVE A DREAM.

267
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,114
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

268
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,617
IT INVOLVED MONICA.

269
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,620
YOU HAD A DREAM ABOUT A GIRL THAT I'M SEEING? OH, THAT IS SO COOL.

270
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,121
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES

271
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,623
I DREAMT ABOUT A GIRL THAT HE WAS SEEING.

272
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,124
ANYWAY, WE'RE TALK ING ABOUT YOUR DREAM.

273
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,126
I LOVE YOU. YOUR DREAM?

274
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,128
DON'T WORRY, THERE WASN'T ANY SEX IN IT OR ANYTHING.

275
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,630
I HAVEN'T DREAMT ABOUT HER LIKE THAT

276
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,633
SINCE I FOUND OUT ABOUT YOU TWO... ISH.

277
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,139
WHAT WAS THE DREAM ABOUT?

278
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,641
WELL... OKAY.

279
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,642
YOU WERE MY GIRLFRIEND

280
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,144
AND WE WERE DOING THE CROSSWORD PUZZLE--

281
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,648
YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU GUYS WERE DOING LAST NIGHT.

282
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,649
SO, THAT'S IT.

283
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,651
I'M IN LOVE WITH MONICA, AND I'LL BE MOVING OUT.

284
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,152
WAIT, JOEY, JOEY.

285
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,655
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH ME.

286
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,657
IT... IT DOESN'T?

287
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,158
NO, IT CAN MEAN ANYTHING...

288
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,160
LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE JEALOUS

289
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,162
THAT I'VE BECOME THE APARTMENT STUD.

290
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,665
KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE YOUR DREAM, DUDE.

291
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,669
OR IT COULD MEAN THAT YOU SAW CHANDLER AND ME TOGETHER

292
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,171
AND WE WERE BEING CLOSE AND STUFF

293
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,675
AND AND YOU JUST WANT TO HAVE THAT WITH SOMEONE, TOO.

294
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,177
WELL, IN THE DREAM, I DID ENJOY THE CLOSENESS.

295
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,181
WELL, IF THAT'S WHAT IT WAS, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

296
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,683
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO MOVE.

297
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,184
OKAY, LOOK, LOOK.

298
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,186
ARE YOU ATTRACTED TO MONICA?

299
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,688
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW

300
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,690
ARE YOU ATTRACTED TO HER?

301
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,692
NOT REALLY.

302
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,694
WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT.

303
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,197
WELL, SURE. I'M JUST WEARING SWEATS.

304
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,700
BUT THAT'S GOOD...

305
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,201
THAT YOU'RE NOT IN LOVE WITH ME

306
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,703
BECAUSE YOU JUST WANT A GIRLFRIEND.

307
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,204
NO, I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST ABOUT

308
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,206
JUST GETTING A GIRLFRIEND, YOU KNOW?

309
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,708
I MEAN, YEAH, I COULD GET A GIRLFRIEND.

310
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,711
YEAH, WE COULD SIT IN THE CHAIR AND DO CROSSWORD PUZZLES

311
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,212
BUT, YOU KNOW, ARE WE EVER GOING TO HAVE

312
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,714
THE CLOSENESS LIKE YOU GUYS HAVE?

313
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,215
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

314
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,217
MONICA AND I WERE FRIENDS BEFORE WE STARTED DATING

315
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,218
SO MAYBE THAT'S IT.

316
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,720
FRIENDS FIRST?

317
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,222
THAT'S INTERESTING.

318
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,223

319
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,224
YOU BECOME FRIENDS AFTER?

320
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,226
NO. NEVER DONE THAT EITHER.

321
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,230
HEY... UM, DO YOU GUYS HAVE A TAPE MEASURE?

322
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,232
OH, YEAH, IT'S ACTUALLY IN MY BEDROOM.

323
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,234

324
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,236
THAT'S RIGHT.

325
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,250
WHAT'S UP, JOEY?

326
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,755
HOW YOU DOING?

327
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,263
OH... EXCUSE ME.

328
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,264
IS THIS YOUR CAR?

329
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,766
YEAH.

330
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,768
I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY NICE OF YOU TO PARK HERE.

331
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,269
YOU'RE BLOCKING THE ENTRANCE.

332
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,270
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

333
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,271
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

334
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,273
WELL, IT'S A PROBLEM FOR ME

335
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,776
WHICH MEANS IT'S A PROBLEM FOR YOU

336
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,777
BECAUSE I'M A COP.

337
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,780
SO AM I.

338
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,284
OH, NO.

339
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,788
OH, OKAY, SO YOU'RE A COP

340
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,790
WHICH MEANS YOU CAN PARK ANYWHERE.

341
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,792
I KNOW THAT, BECAUSE I'M A COP, TOO.

342
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,294
SORRY. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. TEN FOUR.

343
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,796
HEY, WAIT A SECOND.

344
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,297
SO WHAT PRECINCT ARE YOU WITH?

345
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,300
I I'M WITH THE, UM, THE 57th.

346
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,802
OH, I KNOW A GUY IN HOMICIDE UP THERE.

347
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,303
I'M IN VICE.

348
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,807
YEAH, IN FACT, I'M UNDERCOVER RIGHT NOW.

349
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,808
I'M A WHORE.

350
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,311
WHO ELSE IS  IN VICE UP THERE?

351
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,815
UM, DO YOU KNOW, UM, SIPOWITZ?

352
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,318
SIPOWITZ? NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

353
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,820
YEAH, SIPOWITZ, YEAH.

354
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,321
BIG GUY, KIND OF BALD.

355
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,322
NAH, I DON'T KNOW HIM.

356
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,824
OKAY.

357
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,826
DON'T TRY TO CALL HIM OR ANYTHING

358
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,327
BECAUSE HE'S NOT THERE.

359
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,829
HE'S OUT.

360
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,831
HIS, UM... HIS PARTNER JUST DIED.

361
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,835
WOW. WELL, TELL SIPOWITZ I'M REAL SORRY FOR HIS LOSS.

362
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,836
I I SURE WILL.

363
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:57,837
TAKE CARE.

364
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,838
OKAY.

365
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,839
HEY, BY THE WAY

366
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,341
I'M SURE SIPOWITZ IS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT

367
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,343
I HEARD THAT KID FROM SILVER SPOONS

368
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,846
IS REALLY GOOD.

369
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,348
AND WHERE'D YOU FIND MY BADGE?

370
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,349
OH.

371
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,851

372
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,860
HEY, JOEY, WOULD YOU MIND

373
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,863
GIVING ME AND ROSS A HAND MOVING HIS COUCH?

374
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,364
OH, I'D LOVE TO, BUT I GOT ACTING CLASS.

375
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,365
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

376
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,367
I GUESS I COULD BLOW THAT OFF...

377
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,368
FOR YOU.

378
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,374
THANKS.

379
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,376
UH, SAY, RACHEL, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,878
UH, I WAS JUST OVER THERE

381
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,379
TALKING TO MONICA AND CHANDLER

382
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,881
AND, BOY, THEY ARE REALLY TIGHT.

383
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,382
I KNOW.

384
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,384
THAT'S NOT A BAD SITUATION THEY GOT GOING OVER THERE.

385
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,386
UH UH.

386
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,889
THINKING OF GETTING ME ONE OF THOSE.

387
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,894
WHAT'S UP, JOE?

388
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,897
WELL, THE REASON I THINK MONICA AND CHANDLER

389
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:02,401
ARE SO GREAT IS BECAUSE THEY WERE FRIENDS FIRST, YOU KNOW?

390
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,404
SO I ASKED MYSELF, WHO ARE MY FRIENDS?

391
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,405
YOU AND PHOEBE.

392
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,407
I SAW YOU FIRST, SO...

393
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,909

394
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,411
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

395
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,915
I'M SAYING, MAYBE YOU AND I CRANK IT UP A NOTCH.

396
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:23,422
YOU KNOW, HONEY, UM, AS, UH... AS FLATTERED AS I AM

397
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,926
THAT YOU SAW ME FIRST, UH, I JUST...

398
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:31,430
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE CRANKING ANYTHING UP.

399
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,934
WELL, I'LL TREAT YOU REAL NICE.

400
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,440
OH HO.

401
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,944
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, UM...

402
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,947
NO, HONEY, LISTEN, I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA TO BECOME

403
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,950
FRIENDS WITH SOMEONE BEFORE YOU DATE THEM

404
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,453
BUT THE WAY YOU DO IT IS, YOU KNOW, YOU MEET SOMEONE

405
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,455
BECOME THEIR FRIEND, BUILD A FOUNDATION

406
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,457
THEN ASK THEM OUT ON A DATE.

407
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,960
DON'T HIT ON YOUR EXISTING FRIENDS.

408
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,464
WELL, WON'T THAT TAKE LONGER?

409
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,966
YEAH. YEAH.

410
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,971
OH, BUT ONCE YOU FIND IT, OH, IT'S SO WORTH THE WAIT.

411
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:12,972
YEAH.

412
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,473
WELL, I UNDERSTAND.

413
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,474
I UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW.

414
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:20,980
MAN, I WISH I SAW PHOEBE FIRST.

415
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,984
COME HERE TO ME.

416
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:29,488
NO, NO. YOU COME HERE TO ME.

417
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,490
HEY, ROSS.

418
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,491

419
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,993
I BROUGHT REINFORCEMENTS.

420
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,995
OH, GREAT. WHAT, YOU BROUGHT JOEY?

421
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,496
WELL, I BROUGHT THE NEXT BEST THING.

422
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,999
HEY.

423
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,500
CHANDLER? YOU BROUGHT CHANDLER?

424
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,003
THE NEXT BEST THING WOULD BE MONICA.

425
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,005
YOU KNOW, I WOULD BE OFFENDED

426
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,507
BUT MONICA IS FREAKISHLY STRONG, SO...

427
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,509
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I I DREW A SKETCH

428
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,011
OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT, OKAY?

429
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,013
RACH, THAT'S YOU.

430
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,514
THAT'S THE COUCH.

431
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,017
MM HMM. OOH, WHAT'S THAT?

432
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,019
OH, THAT'S ME.

433
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,022
WOW.

434
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:07,026
YOU CERTAINLY THINK A LOT OF YOURSELF.

435
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,529
NO, THAT'S... THAT'S MY ARM.

436
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,534
OH, I SEE.

437
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:20,039
I THOUGHT YOU JUST REALLY, REALLY LIKED YOUR NEW COUCH.

438
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,043
YOU KNOW, JUST... JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD.

439
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,544
OKAY. OKAY.

440
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,546
COME ON, CHANDLER.

441
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,549
ALL RIGHT.

442
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,550
OKAY.

443
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,052
HERE WE GO.

444
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,055
ALL RIGHT, READY, SET, TURN.

445
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,056
OKAY.

446
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,557
TURN.

447
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,059
TURN.

448
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,060

449
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,062
I DON'T THINK WE CAN TURN ANY MORE.

450
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,563
ROSS, I JUST DON'T THINK

451
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,065
IT'S GOING TO FIT.

452
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,066
OH, YEAH, IT WILL.

453
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,567
COME ON, UP. UP, UP, UP.

454
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,568
UP!

455
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,071
HERE WE GO, PIVOT.

456
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,074
PIVOT!

457
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,576
PIVOT!

458
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,079
PIVOT!

459
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,582
PIVOT!

460
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,584
PIVOT.

461
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,588
SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

462
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,094
OKAY, I... I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO PIVOT ANYMORE.

463
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,596
YOU THINK? YOU THINK?

464
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,598
ALL RIGHT, LET'S, UH...

465
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,601
LET'S BRING IT BACK DOWN AND TRY AGAIN.

466
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,103
OKAY. OH...

467
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,105

468
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:33,112
OKAY, YEAH. I THINK IT'S REALLY STUCK NOW.

469
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,615
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT DIDN'T WORK.

470
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,117
I KNOW. ME NEITHER.

471
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,619
I MEAN, YOU HAD A SKETCH.

472
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,121
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

473
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,124
WHAT DID YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAID "PIVOT"?

474
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,632
MAN, I CANNOT FIGURE THIS OUT.

475
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:58,137
YEAH, BECAUSE IT'S NOT 1985.

476
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,139
YOU GUYS, GUESS WHAT.

477
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,641
I... I DITCHED A COP.

478
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,143
WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

479
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,644
WELL, HE CAUGHT ME USING HIS BADGE

480
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,146
AND HE TRIED TO BUST ME.

481
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,647
DAMN REAL COPS!

482
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,150
HOW FAR DID HE CHASE YOU?

483
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,651
WELL, HE DIDN'T REALLY...

484
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,154
HE JUST PICKED UP HIS BADGE AND... AND STOOD THERE.

485
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,655
WOW. MAYBE WE'LL SEE YOU

486
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,657
ON WORLD'S MOST BORING POLICE CHASES.

487
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,660
WHY DID YOU RUN?

488
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,162
I HAD TO.

489
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,663
I MEAN, IMPERSONATING A COP

490
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,165
IS, LIKE, A CLASS E FELONY.

491
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,167
THAT'S TWO TO FOUR YEARS MINI MUM

492
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,169
AND I AM NOT GOING BACK TO THAT HELLHOLE.

493
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:37,176
IF I CAN JUST... GET IT... TO PIVOT

494
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,678
WE'LL BE BACK ON TRACK.

495
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,682
RACH... RACH, CAN I GET SOME HELP, PLEASE?

496
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,184
YEAH.

497
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,186

498
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,188
TURN IT OFF! TURN IT OFF!

499
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,690
OH! ROSS! OH!

500
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,194
MAYBE THE FIREMEN CAN HELP US MOVE THE COUCH

501
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,695
WHEN THEY GET HERE.

502
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,696
WAIT! WAIT!

503
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,198
NOT THE NEW COUCH!

504
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,700
IT'S A NEW COUCH! IT'S A NEW...

505
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,206
HEY.

506
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,207
HEY.

507
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,208
HOW'S IT GOING?

508
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,210
DID YOU MAKE ANY NEW FRIENDS?

509
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,213
YEAH. YEAH, I MET THIS WOMAN.

510
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,214
OKAY, WHOA, WHOA.

511
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,215
WHAT'S SHE LIKE?

512
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,716
UH, WELL...

513
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:21,220
SHE'S REALLY GOOD IN BED.

514
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,222
JOEY, I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO TRY

515
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,723
TO BE FRIENDS FIRST.

516
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,226
WELL, HEY, IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

517
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,227
WHAT? WHY?

518
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,728
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME ADVICE.

519
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,230
NO, YOU GAVE ME A PICKUP LINE.

520
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,731
AS SOON AS I TOLD HER

521
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,235
I WANTED TO BUILD A FOUNDATION AND BE FRIENDS FIRST

522
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,737
I SUDDENLY-- THROUGH NO FAULT OF MY OWN--

523
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,239
BECAME IRRESISTIBLE TO HER.

524
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,741
AND HER ROOMMATE.

525
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,745
WHAT ABOUT THE CLOSENESS?

526
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,247
CLOSENESS, SCHMOSENESS.

527
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,249
THERE WAS THREE OF US, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

528
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,756
ALL RIGHT, HEY, WHO WANTS PIZZA?

529
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,757
I DO. I DO. I DO.

530
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,758
OH, THIS IS GREAT.

531
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,262
CAN YOU BELIEVE I FOUND THIS ON THE SECOND FLOOR?

532
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,265

533
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,266
WHO IS IT?

534
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,767
 N.Y.P.D.

535
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,269
OH, MY GOD.

536
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,272
UH... JUST A MINUTE, OFFICER!

537
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,783
I'M LOOKING FOR PHOEBE BUFFAY.

538
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,285
OH, MY GOD, IT'S HIM.

539
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,286
IT'S THAT COP.

540
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,288
GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. HE FOUND ME.

541
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,289
MY GOD, PHOEBE.

542
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,790
ARE YOU GOING TO GO TO JAIL?

543
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,793
WELL, IF I'M GOING DOWN, YOU GUYS ARE GOING DOWN WITH ME.

544
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,795
WHAT?

545
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,796
HARBORING A FUGITIVE?

546
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,299
THAT'S ONE TO THREE YEARS MINIMUM.

547
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,800
GOOD LUCK, CHANDLER.

548
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,307
OKAY, YOU CAN ARREST ME, FINE, BUT YOU'LL

549
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,309
NEVER MAKE IT STICK, AND YOU KNOW IT.

550
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,810
YEAH, BUT I KIND OF DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

551
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,812
IT'S MY JOB. I MEAN, YOU UNDERSTAND, RIGHT?

552
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,815
YEAH, AS LONG AS YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I'M GOING TO CALL MY LAWYER

553
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,317
AND, ONCE HE PUTS YOU ON THE STAND

554
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,819
HE'S GOING TO MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE A FOOL-- LIKE A FOOL.

555
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,823
MM HMM. I DON'T LIKE LOOKING FOOLISH.

556
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,326
YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE, UH, I DON'T ARREST YOU TODAY.

557
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,328
MAYBE I CAME BY AND YOU WEREN'T HERE.

558
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,830
I WOULD LOVE IT IF I WEREN'T HERE.

559
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,333
OKAY, SINCE, UM, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO JAIL TONIGHT

560
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,335
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULD LIKE

561
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,836
