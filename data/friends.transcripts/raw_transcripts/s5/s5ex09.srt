1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,505
WHAT AM I SITTING ON?

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:08,008
TOP OF THE WORLD?

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,510
DOCK OF THE BAY?

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,511
I'M OUT.

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,015
EW, UNDIES, OH!

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,518
 ALL RIGHT.

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,021
WHOSE ARE THEY?

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,022
WHOSE ARE THEY?

9
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,023
NOT MINE.

10
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,024
WELL, THEY'RE JOEY'S.

11
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,025
THEY GOT TO BE JOEY'S.

12
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,031
YEAH, THEY'RE MINE.

13
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,032
SEE, JOEY'S.

14
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,534
THEY'RE J J J J JOEY'S.

15
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,036
WHY ARE THEY HERE?

16
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,538
I DON'T KNOW, UH...

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,541
WELL, I'M JOEY.

18
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,043
YEAH, I'M DISGUSTING.

19
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:47,047
I TAKE MY UNDERWEAR OFF IN OTHER PEOPLE'S HOMES.

20
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,550
WELL, GET THEM OUT OF HERE.

21
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,052
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

22
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,053
YEAH. YEAH.

23
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,556
TAKE THEM.

24
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,058
OH, I GOT...

25
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,559
JOEY, YOU CAN TOUCH THE EM.

26
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,061
THEY'RE YOUR UNDERWEAR.

27
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,068
CHANDLER, A WORD?

28
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,569
YEAH.

29
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,077
THAT'S IT.

30
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,578
I'M TIRED OF COVER ING FOR YOU TWO.

31
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,579
THIS HAS GOT TO STOP.

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,580
UGH!

33
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,583
AND TIGHTY WHITEYS?

34
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,584
WHAT ARE YOU, EIGHT?

35
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,587
THANK YOU, JOEY. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

36
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,090
WELL, HEY, NO, YOU'RE NOT WELCOME, OKAY?

37
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,091
LOOK, I HATE THIS.

38
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,093
YOU GUYS KEEP EMBARRASSING ME.

39
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,096
YESTERDAY, RACHEL FOUND YOUR RAZOR IN OUR BATHROOM.

40
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,597
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY

41
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,599
SO I SAID IT WAS MINE AND... AND...

42
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,102
AND THAT I WAS PLAYING A WOMAN IN A PLAY.

43
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:47,107
AND, WELL, ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER AND...

44
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,113
WOW, AND AROUND THE ANKLES.

45
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,614
YOU KNOW, THAT IS A TOUGH SPOT.

46
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,615
YEAH, IT WAS.

47
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,117
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, I CAN'T...

48
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,119
ALL THIS LYING HAS BEEN HARD ON US, TOO.

49
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,122
OH, YEAH, I BET ALL THE SEX MAKES IT EASIER.

50
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,625
WELL, YEAH, ACTUALLY.

51
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:09,629
MEANWHILE, I GET RACHEL SHOVING YOUR UNDERWEAR IN MY FACE

52
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,632
AND ASKING WHEN SHE COME SEE ME STAR IN UGLY WOMAN.

53
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,134
WE'LL TRY TO BE MORE CAREFUL, OKAY?

54
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,135
IT'S JUST THAT...

55
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,636
WE DON'T WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW

56
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,138
BECAUSE THIS IS GOING REALLY WELL.

57
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,639
AND MAYBE THE REASON

58
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,642
IT'S GOING REALLY WELL IS... IS BECAUSE IT'S A SECRET.

59
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,644
I KNOW IT SOUNDS REALLY WEIRD

60
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,147
BUT WE'RE JUST BOTH SO BAD AT RELATIONSHIPS.

61
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,148
WE ARE. HELP US.

62
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,152
ALL RIGHT.

63
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,155
BUT YOU DO IT WITH ME ONCE.

64
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,160
JOEY.

65
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,661
DIDN'T THINK SO.

79
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,713
CAN WE PLEASE JUST DROP THIS?

80
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,215
BUT I DON'T GET IT.

81
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,716
I MEAN, DOES ANYBODY ELSE

82
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,719
JUST TAKE OFF THEIR UNDERWEAR WHEN THEY'RE HOT?

83
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,721
HEY, PHOEBE.

84
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,722
HI, PHEEBS.

85
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,724
WHAT ARE YOU READING?

86
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,226
WUTHERING HEIGHTS.

87
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,228
I'M TAKING A LITERATURE CLASS AT THE NEW SCHOOL

88
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,730
AND I HAVE TO FINISH IT FOR THE FIRST SESSION TOMORROW.

89
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,233
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE TAKING A CLASS. THAT'S SO COOL.

90
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,236
YEAH, WELL, I REALLY LIKED THAT LAMAZE CLASS I TOOK

91
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,238
YOU KNOW, AND I JUST THOUGHT THIS TIME

92
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,241
I'D GO FOR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, A LITTLE MORE INTELLECTUAL

93
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,243
WITH A LESS PAINFUL FINAL EXAM.

94
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,245
HONEY, THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

95
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,246
YEAH.

96
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,248
OH, YOU SHOULD COME WITH ME.

97
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,750
OH, YEAH, THEN I'LL HAVE SOMEONE TO SIT WITH.

98
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,751
OKAY.

99
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,253
YAY! OKAY.

100
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,754
BUT ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE TIME TO READ IT?

101
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,256
I READ THAT IN HIGH SCHOOL.

102
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,258
OH, THIS IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH FUN.

103
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,260
OKAY, SHH. I HAVE TO FINISH.

104
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,763
UH, W WAIT. WHAT TIME DOES THE CLASS START?

105
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,265

00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,270
HI.

107
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,271
HI.

108
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,772
WHAT'S WRONG, BUDDY?

109
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,275
SOMEONE AT WORK ATE MY SANDWICH.

110
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,279
WELL, WHAT DID THE POLICE SAY?

111
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,282
MY THANKSGIVING LEFTOVER SANDWICH.

112
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,285
I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE JUST ATE IT.

113
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,786
ROSS, IT'S JUST A SANDWICH.

114
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,288
JUST A SANDWICH?

115
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,790
LOOK, I AM 30 YEARS OLD, OKAY?

116
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,793
I'M GOING BE DIVORCED TWICE, AND I JUST GOT EVICTED.

117
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,797
THAT SANDWICH WAS THE ONLY GOOD THING GOING ON IN MY LIFE.

118
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,800
SOMEONE ATE THE ONLY GOOD THING GOING ON IN MY LIFE.

119
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,304
THAT'S A NICE SWEATER VEST.

120
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,807
OKAY, LOOK, I HAVE ENOUGH STUFF

121
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,309
FOR ONE MORE SANDWICH.

122
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,811
I MEAN, I WAS GOING TO EAT IT MYSELF, BUT...

123
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,814
MON, TH THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLE.

124
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,316
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

125
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,819
BUT I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE ATE IT.

126
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,324
I MEAN, LOOK, I LEFT A NOTE AND EVERYTHING.

127
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,825
"KNOCK KNOCK.

128
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,826
"WHO'S THERE?

129
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,828
"ROSS GELLER'S LUNCH.

130
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,331
"ROSS GELLER'S LUNCH, WHO?

131
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:35,835
ROSS GELLER'S LUNCH, PLEASE DON'T TAKE ME, OKAY?"

132
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,839
I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T GO HOME WEARING YOUR LUNCH.

133
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,841
 OKAY, LOOK

134
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,343
YOU WANT TO HOLD ON TO YOUR FOOD?

135
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,844
YOU'VE GOT TO SCARE PEOPLE OFF.

136
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,346
I LEARNED THAT LIVING ON THE STREET.

137
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,347
REALLY?

138
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,350
SO, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, PHEEBS?

139
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,354
STUFF LIKE, UH, "KEEP YOUR MITTS OFF MY GRUB"?

140
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,358
SAY, ROSS, WHEN YOU PICTURE PHOEBE LIVING ON THE STREET

141
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,360
IS SHE SURROUNDED BY THE ENTIRE CAST OF ANNIE?

142
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,864
OKAY, THIS'LL KEEP THEM AWAY FROM YOUR STUFF.

143
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,370
OH. WHOA. JEEZ.

144
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,372
WHOA.

145
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,374
PHOEBE, YOU ARE A BADASS.

146
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:18,378
SOMEDAY, I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THE TIME I STABBED A COP.

147
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,379
PHOEBE?

148
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,381
WHAT? HE STABBED ME FIRST.

149
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,887
SEE, THE BRONTE SISTERS WERE REALLY REMARKABLE WOMEN

150
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:28,888
FOR THEIR TIME.

151
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,890
THEY LIVED IN A PATRIARCHAL SOCIETY...

152
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,393
SORRY I'M LATE, BUT I LEFT LATE.

153
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,396
OKAY.

154
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,898
PHEEBS, WHAT IS THE BOOK ABOUT?

155
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,900
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU READ IT IN HIGH SCHOOL.

156
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,403
WELL, YEAH, BUT THEN I REMEMBERED I STARTED IT

157
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,904
BUT THEN THERE WAS THIS PEP RALLY

158
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,406
AND I WAS ON TOP OF THE PYRAMID.

159
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,409
ANYWAY, WHAT'S THE BOOK ABOUT?

160
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,911
OKAY, IT'S THIS TRAGIC LOVE STORY

161
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,913
BETWEEN CATHY AND HEATHCLIFF.

162
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,917
AND IT TAKES PLACE ON THESE REALLY CREEPY MOORS IN ENGLAND.

163
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,420
WHICH I THINK REPRESENT THE WILDNESS

164
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,422
OF HEATHCLIFF'S CHARACTER.

165
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,923
I TOTALLY GET SYMBOLISM.

166
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,928
HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THE THEME OF THIS BOOK?

167
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,930
UH, LET'S SEE... RACHEL GREEN?

168
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,437
UH, WELL, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY

169
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,440
THAT IT'S A TRAGIC LOVE STORY

170
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,444
WELL, THAT'S SORT OF A GIVEN, BUT... YES.

171
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,445
ANYONE ELSE?

172
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,446
OH, OH, OH.

173
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,449
SYMBOLISM, A ND THE, UH...

174
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,451
WILDNESS OF THE MOORS

175
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,955
WHICH I THINK IS MIRRORED IN THE WILDNESS

176
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,958
OF HEATHCLIFF'S CHARACTER.

177
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,961
EXCELLENT.

178
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,464
WHAT RACHEL HAS SHREWDLY OBSERVED HERE

179
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,965
IS AT THE HEART...

180
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,967
YOU COMPLETELY STOLE MY ANSWER.

181
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,969
I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS.

182
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:50,970
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

183
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,472
YOU DIDN'T EVEN READ IT.

184
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,475
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

185
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,977
UH, YOU, IN THE BLUE SHIRT.

186
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,982
I THINK THAT YOURS IS A QUESTION

187
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,485
WITH MANY POSSIBLE ANSWERS.

188
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,488
WOULD YOU CARE TO VENTURE ONE?

189
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,991
WOULD YOU CARE TO VENTURE ONE?

190
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,494
ARE YOU JUST REPEATING WHAT I'M SAYING?

191
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,997
ARE YOU JUST REPEATING WHAT I'M SAYING?

192
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,499
ALL RIGHT.

193
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,000
LET'S MOVE ON.

194
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,002
OKAY, THEN.

195
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,009
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY THAT YOU HADN'T READ THE BOOK?

196
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,511
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT HIM

197
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,012
TO THINK I WAS STUP ID.

198
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,514
I MEAN, THAT WAS REALLY EMBARRASSING.

199
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,015
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

200
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,017
PHOEBE?

201
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,519
YEAH?

202
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,022
PHOEBE, YOUR NOTE... AMAZING.

203
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,025
NOT ONLY DID NO ONE TOUCH MY SANDWICH

204
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,028
BUT PEOPLE AT WORK ARE ACTUALLY AFRAID OF ME.

205
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,530
A GUY CALLED ME "MENTAL."

206
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,533
"MENTAL" GELLER. YEAH.

207
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,036
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED A COOL NICKNAME LIKE THAT.

208
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,539
YEAH, THE BEST YOU GOT IN HIGH SCHOOL

209
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,541
WAS "WET PANTS GELLER."

210
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,543
IT WAS THE WATER FOUNTAIN, OKAY?!

211
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,045
ANYWAY...

212
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,548
PEOPLE ARE WRITING REPORTS FOR ME.

213
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,552
UH, PUSHING BACK DEADLINES TO FIT MY SCHEDULE.

214
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,555
I'M TELLING YOU, YOU GET TOUGH WITH PEOPLE

215
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,558
AND YOU CAN GET ANYTHING YOU WANT.

216
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,561
HEY, TRIBBIANI, GIVE ME THAT COFFEE, NOW.

217
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,572
THIS WAS REALLY FUN.

218
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,576
I'VE BEEN WONDERING IF YOU WERE EVER GOING TO ASK ME OUT.

219
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,579
SO YOU, UH, STILL WONDERING?

220
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,080
NO.

221
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,081
WE JUST WENT OUT.

222
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,085
YOU'RE SMART.

223
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,087
I LIKE THAT.

224
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,096
OH, CANDLES.

225
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,600
WHAT IS THAT, A BLANKET?

226
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,101
A VIDEO CAMERA?

227
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,102
OH, MY GOD!

228
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,104
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU THOUGHT

229
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:09,609
YOU WERE GOING TO VIDEOTAPE US HAVING SEX ON THE FIRST DATE.

230
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,616
HI.

231
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:21,120
JOEY, IS WHAT  SHE JUST SAID, UM...

232
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,622
OH, MY GOD.

233
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,124
YOU WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO...

234
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,130
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

235
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,635
AND WITH CHANDLER IN THE NEXT ROOM?

236
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,136
WHAT, ARE YOU SICK?

237
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,643
I'M JOEY.

238
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,648
I MEAN, I'M DISGUSTING.

239
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,653
I MAKE LOW BUDGET ADULT FILMS.

240
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,159
HUH.

241
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,665
YOU GUYS PROMISED

242
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,666
YOU'D BE MORE CAREFUL.

243
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,167
I MEAN, COME ON, THE GOOD JOEY NAME

244
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,169
IS BEING DRAGGED THROUGH THE MUD HERE.

245
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,672
WE'RE SO SORRY.

246
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,673
YEAH.

247
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,174
WELL, I'M TELLING EVERYONE ABOUT YOU.

248
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,676
IT'S THE ONLY  WAY

249
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,678
TO EXPLAIN THE UNDERWEAR, AND THE VIDEO CAMERA

250
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,179
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A PIG.

251
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,182
NO, WAIT. THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER EXPLANATION.

252
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,684
YOU... YOU COULD TELL THEM

253
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,686
THAT YOU HAD TO MAKE AN ADULT FILM

254
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,688
FOR YOUR... ADULT FILM CLASS.

255
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,689
YEAH, I LIKE THAT.

256
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,691
BUT, NO, HOW DOES THAT EXPLAIN

257
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,194
WHY RACHEL FOUND MY UNDERWEAR AT YOUR PLACE?

258
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,197
I DON'T KNOW.

259
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,700
WELL, GET READY TO COME OUT OF THE NON GAY CLOSET.

260
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,201
JUST WAIT, PLEASE--

261
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,203
I PROMISE WE'LL COME UP WITH SOMETHING.

262
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,705
JUST GIVE US A LITTLE MORE TIME.

263
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,206
ALL RIGHT.

264
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:51,711
HEY, BUT IT BETTER MAKE  ME LOOK REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

265
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,213
OH, AND ANOTHER THING.

266
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,215
THE VIDEO CAMERA?

267
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,717
NICE.

268
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,227
UM, ROSS, MAY I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU?

269
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,229
OH, OF COURSE, DONALD.

270
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,731
WE'VE BEEN GETTING REPORTS

271
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,234
OF SOME VERY ANGRY BEHAVIOR ON YOUR PART.

272
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,736
WHAT?

273
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,237
THREATENING LETTERS

274
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,739
REFUSAL TO MEET DEADLINES.

275
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,742
APPARENTLY PEOPLE NOW CALL YOU "MENTAL."

276
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,244
YEAH.

277
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,749
WE WANT YOU TO SPEAK TO A PSYCHIATRIST.

278
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,251
OH, NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

279
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,253
UH, THIS IS SO SILLY.

280
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:38,257
UM, THIS IS ALL JUST BECAUSE OF A SANDWICH.

281
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,760
A SANDWICH?

282
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,261
YEAH. YOU SEE, MY...

283
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,264
MY SISTER MAKES THESE AMAZING TURKEY SANDWICHES.

284
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,267
HER SECRET IS, SHE PUTS AN EXTRA SLICE

285
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,770
OF GRAVY SOAKED BREAD IN THE MIDDLE.

286
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,772
I CALL IT THE "MOIST MAKER."

287
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,274
ANYWAY, I I PUT MY SANDWICH

288
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,276
IN THE FRIDGE OVER HERE, AND...

289
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,779
YOU KNOW WHAT?

290
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,780
I I I'M SORRY.

291
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,282
I I I BELIEVE I ATE THAT.

292
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,788
YOU ATE MY SANDWICH?

293
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,289
IT WAS A SIMPLE MISTAKE.

294
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,791
IT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE.

295
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,794
OH, OH, REALLY?

296
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,798
DID YOU CONFUSE IT WITH YOUR OWN TURKEY SANDWICH

297
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,299
WITH A MOIST MAKER?

298
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,301
NO, I...

299
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,805
DO YOU PERHAPS REMEMBER SEEING.

300
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,807
A NOTE ON TOP OF IT?

301
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,809
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A JOKE

302
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,311
OR... LIMERICK OF SOME KIND...

303
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:36,816
THAT SAID IT WAS MY SANDWICH.

304
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,817
NOW, NOW, CALM DOWN.

305
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,819
COME LOOK IN MY OFFICE.

306
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,321
SOME OF IT MAY STILL BE IN THE TRASH.

307
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,324
WHAT?

308
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,326
WELL, IT WAS QUITE LARGE.

309
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,829
I HAD TO THROW MOST OF IT AWAY.

310
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,331
YOU, YOU, YOU...

311
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,835
YOU THREW MY SANDWICH AWAY?

312
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,837
MY SANDWICH?

313
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,841
MY SANDWICH?!

314
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,842
HI.

315
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,843
HI.

316
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,344
SO, UM WHAT'S THIS BOOK ABOUT?

317
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,846
YOU DIDN'T READ THIS ONE EITHER?

318
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,347
WELL, I WAS GOING TO

319
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,349
BUT I ACCIDENTALLY READ SOMETHING ELSE.

320
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,350
WHAT?

321
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,852
VOGUE.

322
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,355
OKAY, SO TELL ME ABOUT THIS JANE EYRE WOMAN.

323
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,357
NO, YOU SHOULD HAVE READ IT YOURSELF.

324
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,358
OH, COME ON, PHOEBE

325
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,360
DON'T BE SUCH A GOODY GOODY.

326
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,362
FINE.

327
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,364
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

328
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,365
SO, JANE EYRE?

329
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,368
FIRST OF ALL, YOU'D THINK SHE'S A WOMAN

330
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,369
BUT SHE'S NOT.

331
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,370
SHE'S A CYBORG.

332
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,872
A CYBORG?

333
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,375
ISN'T THAT LIKE A ROBOT?

334
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,379
YEAH. THIS BOOK WAS LIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF ITS TIME.

335
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,882
SORRY, I'M LATE.

336
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,383
LET'S GET STARTED.

337
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,887
SO, WHAT DID EVERYBODY THINK OF JANE EYRE?

338
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,389
UM, RACHEL AND I WERE JUST DISCUSSING IT

339
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,393
AND SHE ACTUALLY HAD SOME VERY INTERESTING INSIGHTS.

340
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,895
WELL, GO AHEAD, RACHEL.

341
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,397
UM, THANK YOU, PHOEBE.

342
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,901
UM, WELL, WHAT STRUCK ME MOST

343
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,903
WHEN READING JANE EYRE WAS

344
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,406
UH, HOW THE BOOK WAS SO AHEAD OF ITS TIME.

345
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:11,410
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FEMINISM, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

346
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,913
YEAH, WELL, FEMINISM, YES.

347
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,415
BUT ALSO, THE ROBOTS.

348
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,421
HEY.

349
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,924
HEY. OKAY...

350
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,427
SO, UM, SINCE THAT VIDEO CAMERA THING DIDN'T WORK OUT...

351
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:32,932
UM, I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD GIVE YOU JUST A LITTLE PREVIEW.

352
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:33,933

353
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,935
YOU'RE NAKED IN THIS PICTURE.

354
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,936
I KNOW.

355
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,439
OH, THAT'S ROSS.

356
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,448
ROSS?

357
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,952
HEY, CHANDLER.

358
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,954
MONICA?

359
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,956
ROSS, ARE YOU OKAY?

360
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,457
I'M FINE.

361
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,460
I SAW A PSYCHIATRIST AT WORK TODAY.

362
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,962
WHY?

363
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,464
ON ACCOUNT OF MY RAGE.

364
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:10,469
WHICH, IF I MAY SAY RIGHT NOW, IS OUT OF CONTROL.

365
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,972
HE GAVE ME A PILL FOR IT.

366
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:14,974
A PILL?

367
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,475
MM HMM.

368
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,477
WELL, WHEN THE PSYCHIATRIST TOLD ME

369
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,980
THAT I HAD TO TAKE A LEAVE OF ABSENCE

370
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,982
BECAUSE I YELLED AT MY BOSS

371
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,484
I STARTED TO GET WORKED UP AGAIN.

372
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,486
SO, HE OFFERED ME A TRANQUILIZER

373
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,989
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA

374
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:30,990
SO I TOOK IT.

375
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:33,993
WAIT A MINUTE.

376
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,995
THEY'RE MAKING YOU TAKE TIME OFF WORK?

377
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,997
AND YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT?

378
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,498
I DON'T KNOW.

379
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,501
IT'S GOING TO BE WEIRD NOT HAVING A JOB FOR A WHILE

380
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:46,005
BUT I... I DEFINITELY DON'T CARE ABOUT MY SANDWICH.

381
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,506

382
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,507
YEAH, YOU KNOW, I HATE IT

383
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,010
WHEN THEY MAKE ME SEE THE SHRINK AT MY OFFICE.

384
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,013
YOU KNOW, HE'S ALWAYS LIKE, "WHOA, MAYBE YOUR COLLEAGUES

385
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,515
WILL LIKE YOU BETTER IF YOU LIKE YOURSELF BETTER."

386
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,017
WHO NEEDS THAT?

387
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,018
YOU DO.

388
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,519
I KNOW.

389
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,523
UH, IT WAS JUST SO EMBARRASSING

390
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,526
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU JUST LET ME GO ON  AND ON AND ON LIKE THAT.

391
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,528
I'M SORRY.

392
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,030
IT WAS JUST SO FUNNY

393
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,534
WHEN YOU STARTED COMPARING JANE EYRE TO ROBOCOP.

394
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,538
THAT WAS NOT FUNNY.

395
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,040
WELL, I SNAPPED, OKAY?

396
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,542
YOU WEREN'T TAKING THE CLASS SERIOUSLY.

397
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,044
PHOEBE, COME ON, WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?

398
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,047
I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE SOMETHING WE COULD DO TOGETHER.

399
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,049
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN.

400
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,050
WELL, YEAH, FUN IS GOOD

401
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,052
BUT, YOU KNOW, I ALSO WANTED TO LEARN.

402
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,553
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS

403
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,056
TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY LEARNED IN HIGH SCHOOL

404
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,557
AND I NEVER WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL.

405
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,558
OH.

406
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,562
OH, SO YOU REALLY WANTED TO LEARN?

407
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:49,068
YEAH, YOU KNOW, PHEEBS, I JUST WANTED TO HAVE FUN.

408
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,070
YOU KNOW WHO YOU SHOULD GO WITH?

409
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,572
I KNOW! I KNOW! I KNOW!

410
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,077
MONICA, YOU ASKED THE QUESTION.

411
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,086
OH, YEAH.

412
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,591

413
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,596

414
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,598
AH, OH MY GOD! THAT'S MONICA!

415
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,600
OH, NO, NO.

416
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,601
NO, NO, NO, NO.

417
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,105
YOU GET AWAY FROM ME, YOU SICK, SICK, SICKO.

418
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,607
WHAT'S GOING ON?

419
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,110
JOEY HAS GOT A SECRET PEEPHOLE.

420
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,113
OH, NO, NO, NO.

421
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,115
YES. HE HAS A NAKED PICTURE OF MONICA.

422
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,616
HE TAKES NAKED PICTURES OF US.

423
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,119
THEN HE EATS CHICKEN AND THEN HE LOOKS AT THEM.

424
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,622
LOOK.

425
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,124
DUDE, THAT'S MY SISTER.

426
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,125
GIVE ME THAT.

427
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,626
ALL RIGHT, WAIT, JUST WAIT.

428
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,129
EVERYBODY JUST CALM DOWN, OKAY?

429
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,631
LET'S GIVE OUR FRIEND JOEY A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN

430
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,633
WHY HE'S SUCH A BIG PERVERT.

431
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,137
NO, I AM NOT A PERVERT, OKAY?

432
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,140
IT'S JUST, I JUST KIND OF...

433
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,144
OH LOOK, LOOK, I THINK I CAN EXPLAIN THIS.

434
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,146
THANK YOU.

435
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,148
JOEY'S A SEX ADDICT.

436
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,651
WHAT?! NO, I'M NOT.

437
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:16,155
IT'S OKAY. IT'S GOOD.

438
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,657
IT'S GOOD. IT'S A DISEASE.

439
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,160
NO, NO, I AM NOT A SEX ADDICT.

440
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,162
YES, YOU ARE.

441
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,663
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO EXPLAIN

442
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,165
ALL THIS STUFF.

443
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,667
NO, IT ISN'T. NO, IT'S NOT.

444
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,170
BECAUSE YOU COULD ALSO EXPLAIN IT WITH THE TRUTH.

445
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,671
 WELL, WHAT  IS THE TRUTH?

446
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,672
YEAH.

447
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,674
YEAH, WHAT'S GOING ON?

448
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,682
I SLEPT WITH MONICA.

449
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,190
WELL, LET'S...

450
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,692
LET'S SEE WHAT EVERYBODY THINKS OF THAT.

451
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,697
OH, NO.

452
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,200
YOU SLEPT WITH MY SISTER?

453
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,202
UH, YES... BUT IT WAS...

454
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,704
WE JUST DID IT ONCE... IN LONDON.

455
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,707
THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR MY RAGE.

456
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,713
MONICA, IS THIS TRUE?

457
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,715
OF COURSE IT'S TRUE.

458
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,718
HOW ELSE WOULD YOU EXPLAIN ALL THE WEIRD STUFF

459
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,720
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON?

460
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,223
YES, IT'S TRUE.

461
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,725
 OKAY, BUT IF IT ONLY HAPPENED

462
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,227
THAT ONE TIME, HOW COME WE FOUND

463
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,229
YOUR UNDERWEAR IN OUR APARTMENT THE OTHER DAY?

464
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,730
UH... OY.

465
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,232
THAT WAS THE UNDERWEAR

466
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,235
I WAS WEARING THAT NIGHT IN LONDON.

467
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,736
RIGHT, MONICA?

468
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,242
I GUESS I WANTED TO KEEP IT...

469
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,245
AS A SOUVENIR.

470
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,749
MY GOD, MONICA.

471
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,750
ARE YOU SURE, JOE?

472
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,253
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT JUST A SEX ADDICT?

473
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,256
NO, AND IF ANYONE'S

474
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,759
A SEX ADDICT HERE, IT'S MONICA.

475
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,760
YEAH, YEAH.

476
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,763
SHE HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET ME BACK IN THE SACK

477
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,764
EVER SINCE LONDON.

478
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,766
SO THAT'S  WHY SHE GAVE YOU

479
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,768
A NAKED PICTURE OF HERSELF.

480
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,270
THAT MAKES SENSE.

481
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,273
AND THE VIDEO CAMERA?

482
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,774
UH, MONICA?

483
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:20,279
I GUESS I SET UP THE VIDEO CAMERA

484
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,782
TO TRY AND ENTICE JOEY.

485
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:27,286
BUT, SADLY, I COULD NOT BE ENTICED.

486
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,791
OH, MONICA, THIS HAS TO STOP NOW.

487
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,294
I KNOW, I KNOW.

488
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,795
I KNOW. I WILL.

489
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:40,299
AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF WE ALL COULD JUST, YOU KNOW

490
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:44,303
JUST DROP IT IMMEDIATELY. AND FOREVER.

491
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,804
OKAY.

492
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,307
THAT IS... IF YOU CAN RESIST ME.

493
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,310
I'LL GIVE  IT MY BEST SHOT.

494
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,313
WELL, GOOD LUCK.

495
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,814
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

496
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,317
I MEAN, YOU REALLY KEPT JOEY'S UNDERWEAR?

497
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,818
WHY?

498
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,320
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

499
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:07,826
I'M MONICA.

500
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,828
I'M DISGUSTING.

501
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:13,832
I STALK GUYS AND KEEP THEIR UNDERPANTS.

502
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,339
WELL, I THINK WE'VE ALL LEARNED SOMETHING

503
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,841
ABOUT WHO'S DISGUSTING AND WHO'S NOT.

504
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,343
HUH?

505
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,344
ALL RIGHT.

506
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,347
NOW... I'M GOING TO GET BACK TO MY BUCKET.

507
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,849
I'M ONLY EATING THE SKIN

508
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,852
SO THE CHICKEN'S UP FOR GRABS.

509
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,360
I REALLY THOUGHT YOU WERE MAKING A GOOD POINT

510
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,362
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, UNTIL YOU GOT CUT OFF.

511
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,365
I KNOW. WHAT'S UP WITH THAT GIRL MONICA?

512
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,367
I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T COME WITH HER.

513
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,370
HEY, EVERYBODY.

514
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,371
EVERYBODY, GUESS WHAT?

515
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,374
I JUST CONVINCED CARL TO GIVE US A TEST NEXT WEEK.

516
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,875
A TEST?!

517
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,878
OH, COME ON, TESTS MAKE US ALL BETTER LEARNERS.

518
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,883
OH, YEAH! WE SHOULD HAVE ESSAY QUESTIONS!
