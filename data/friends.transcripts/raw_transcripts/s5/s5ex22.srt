1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,515
WHAT'S GOING ON?

2
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:19,019
HUH? WELL, MY EYE IS A LITTLE ITCHY.

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,022
UH... MINE, TOO. YEAH.

4
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,523
WOW, IT'S REALLY RED.

5
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,525
YOU SHOULD GO SEE MY EYE DOCTOR.

6
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,528
RICHARD? I'M NOT GOING  TO GO SEE YOUR EX BOYFRIEND.

7
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,030
RICHARD-- THAT'S ALL I EVER HEAR.

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,531
RICHARD, RICHARD, RICHARD.

9
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,033
SINCE WE'VE BEEN GOING OUT

10
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,535
I THINK I'VE MENTIONED HIS NAME TWICE.

11
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,537
OKAY, SO RICHARD, RICHARD.

12
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,040
IT'S NOT RICHARD, OKAY?

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,042
IT'S THIS NEW GUY, AND HE'S REALLY GOOD.

14
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,544
WELL, I'M SORRY, I'M NOT GOING TO AN EYE DOCTOR.

15
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,048
OH, GOD, HERE WE GO. WHAT?

16
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,550
ANYTIME ANYTHING COMES CLOSE TO TOUCHING HER EYE

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,552
OR ANYONE ELSE'S, SHE, LIKE, FREAKS OUT.

18
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,554
WATCH. WATCH.

00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,556
ROSS! COME ON. THAT'S... ALL RIGHT, FINE, OKAY

20
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,058
I HAVE A WEIRD THING WITH MY EYE.

21
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,060
CAN WE JUST NOT TALK ABOUT IT, PLEASE?

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,562
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

23
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,564
HEY, RACH, YOU KNOW THAT GREAT SONG

24
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,066
UM, "ME, MYSELF AND...EYE"?

25
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,068
AAH! MONICA! COME ON.

26
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,070
HEY, DOES ANYONE WANT TO GET SOME LUNCH?

27
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,071
ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, SAY "EYE."

28
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,073
ROSS! STOP IT! COME ON.

29
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,574
HOW MUCH DID EYE LOVE

30
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,076

31
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,077

00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,081
THAT'S ENOUGH! COME ON.

YOU OKAY THERE, MAN?

36
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,585
YEAH. I GOT TOO EXCITED.

50
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,635
ALL RIGHT, I GOT TO GO.

51
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,137
I'M TAKING BEN TO THE PARK.

52
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,638
OH, GIVE HIM A KISS FOR ME.

53
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,639

00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,642

57
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,645
I AM SO SORRY YOU GOT CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT.

58
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,647
I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE SO OUT THERE

59
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,649
BUT I AM FURIOUS WITH HIM.

60
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,153
WOW. UM...

61
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,654
CALM DOWN?

62
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,159
I'M TRYING, BUT, MAN, THAT GUY CAN PUSH MY BUTTONS.

63
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,162
WHY ARE YOU SO MAD AT HIM?

64
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,663
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

65
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,165
IT JUST SEEMS... YOU WANT

66
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,167

67
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,668
KEEP TALKING.

68
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:52,172
HAS ANYONE SEEN MY LIST, BY THE WAY?

69
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,674
UH, NO, PHEEBS. WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?

70
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,676
IT'S A PIECE OF PAPER, AND IT SAYS "ROSS" ON IT.

71
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,677
I SEE.

72
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,181
HI. HEY. HEY.

73
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,184
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH ESTELLE, AND GUESS WHAT?

74
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,186
I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!

75
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,188
CONGRATULATIONS! THAT'S AMAZING.

76
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,189

77
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,191

00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,198
AND THEN, SHE DISAPPEARS

82
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,201
BUT I FIND OUT WHERE SHE LIVES, AND WHEN I GET THERE

83
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,702
THIS, LIKE, OLD LADY ANSWERS THE DOOR

84
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,204
AND I SAY, "WHERE'S BETSY?"

85
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:30,210
RIGHT? AND SHE SAYS, "BETSY'S BEEN DEAD FOR TEN YEARS."

86
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,712
OOH... CHILLING.

87
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,713
YEAH.

88
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,215
OH, AND THE BEST PART IS

00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,217
WE'RE FILMING IN THE DESERT OUTSIDE OF VEGAS.

90
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,719
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, BUDDY? I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, BUDDY.

91
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,721
ROAD TRIP! YEAH. WE CAN RENT A CAR.

00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,726
OOH, WAIT, MY GRANDMOTHER'S DEAD.

00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,235
NO, NO.

96
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,737
HER CAB-- SHE PROBABLY WON'T BE USING IT.

97
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,239
YOU COULD DRIVE IT TO LAS VEGAS.

98
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,241

IS THIS OKAY WITH YOU?

105
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,752
CHANDLER, YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK FOR MY PERMISSION.

106
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,754

I MEAN, WE'RE GOING TO PROBABLY HAVE TO CLEAN THIS UP, YOU KNOW?

116
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,779
I MEAN, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RESCHEDULE.

117
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,782
IF YOU THOUGHT THAT THIS MESS WAS GOING TO BOTHER ME

118
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,284

196
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,449
A SMALL PUFF OF AIR IN EACH EYE.

197
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,451
W WH WHAT?

198
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,452

00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,454
NOW, COME ON!

200
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,457

00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,460
ONE, TWO, THREE.

203
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,463
WHOOPS! SORRY.

204
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,464

00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,974
I'M GOING TO HOLD HER HEAD.

212
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,975
THAT'S OKAY.

213
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,477
OKAY. OKAY.

214
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,478
OKAY.

215
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,480
ONE... UH HUH.

216
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,481
TWO...

217
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,482
I'M SORRY.

218
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,983
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE YOUNG

219
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,485
YOU PROBABLY DON'T

220
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,986
HAVE GLAUCOMA.

221
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,987

222
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,489
OKAY, SO...

223
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,991
IT'S WAS VERY, VERY NICE TO MEET YOU, SIR.

224
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,994
OH, HEY... WHAT... ARE YOU CRAZY?

225
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,996
OKAY, YOU HAVE A SMALL , MINOR INFECTION

226
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,997
IN THAT LEFT EYE.

227
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,499
I WANT YOU TO TAKE THESE DROPS

228
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,501
THREE TIMES  A DAY FOR A WEEK

229
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,002
AND YOU'LL BE AS GOOD AS NEW.

230
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,505
NO, I DON'T PUT THINGS IN MY EYE.

231
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,006
OKAY, THEN, I GUESS WE'LL SEE YOU

232
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,007

233
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,009

00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,011
OKAY, JUST GIVE ME THE DAMN DROPS.

235
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,014

VERY GOOD, MONICA.

238
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,024
YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

239
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,025
I SURE DO.

240
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,531
AND YOU DON'T GET ONE

241
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,037
YOU KNOW, I GOT TO TELL YOU

242
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,539
THOSE EYE DROPS ARE A MIRACLE.

243
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,541
MY EYE IS 100% BETTER.

244
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,543
THEY'RE STILL IN MY COAT.

245
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,544
DAMN.

246
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,545
HEY.

247
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,046
HEY, YOU READY TO GO?

248
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,548
YEAH. LISTEN, HOW COLD IS IT GOING TO BE THERE?

249
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,050
DO I NEED A COAT OR WILL ALL THESE SWEATER VESTS BE ENOUGH.

250
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,052
WHAT?

251
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,554
I LOVE YOU.

252
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,558
MAN, I WISH ROSS WAS COMING WITH US, YOU KNOW?

253
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,559
I'M GOING TO MISS HIM.

254
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,060
THANKS A LOT.

255
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,562
I JUST GOT THAT JERK OUT OF MY MIND.

256
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,564
HEY, SO WHERE ARE WE STAYING?

257
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,065
IS THE MOVIE PUTTING US UP

258
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,567
IN A BIG HOTEL SUITE?

259
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,568
NO, NOT REALLY.

260
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,569
IT'S AN INDEPENDENT FILM

261
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,070
SO WE DON'T HAVE A REAL BIG BUDGET.

262
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,072
I FIGURED I'D JUST STAY IN YOUR ROOM.

263
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,074
I SEE, BUT ONCE YOU GET YOUR FIRST PAYCHECK

264
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,577
YOU'LL BE SPRINGING FOR A BIG HOTEL SUITE, RIGHT?

265
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,578
I MEAN, LEAD IN A MOVIE--

266
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,079
THEY MUST BE PAYING YOU A LOT.

267
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,581
OH, YEAH. CHECK THIS OUT--

268
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,083
FOR EVERY DOLLAR SHUTTER SPEED MAKES

269
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,586
ONE PENNY OF IT GOES RIGHT IN JOEY'S POCKET.

270
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,087
SO YOU DON'T GET PAID

271
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,089
UNLESS THE MOVIE MAKES MONEY?

272
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,593
DID YOU NOT HEAR THE PLOT OF THE MOVIE?

273
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,095
SHE'S BEEN DEAD FOR TEN YEARS.

274
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,598
I'M GOING TO BE A MILLIONAIRE!

275
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,101
HEY. HEY. HEY.

276
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,604
JUST WANTED TO SAY GOOD BYE TO YOU GUYS

277
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,105
AND TO SEE IF MAYBE YOU GUYS

278
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,608
WILL PLACE A LITTLE BET FOR ME, HUH?

279
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,109
20 BUCKS ON BLACK 15.

280
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,612
YOU GOT IT. ALL RIGHT.

281
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,616
YOU REMEMBER THE NUMBER, RIGHT?

282
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,617
YEAH. BLACK 13.

283
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,618

284
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,120

I'LL SAY GOOD BYE AT THE CAR. OKAY.

288
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,129
OH, ANYBODY WANT TO SAY GOOD BYE TO ME AT THE CAR?

289
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,632
OH, HONEY, I'LL SAY GOOD BYE TO YOU AT THE CAR

290
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,133
IF YOU DON'T MIND THE PUS.

291
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,637
SEE YA.

292
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,138
NO, WAIT A MINUTE.

293
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,139
THE PUS IS GOOD.

294
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,141
IT MEANS IT'S HEALING.

295
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,649
HEY, PHEEBS, WHATCHA READING?

296
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,651

00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,664
PHOEBE, COME ON.

301
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,666
OH, I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

302
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,170
PHEEBS, ARE YOU MAD AT ME OR SOMETHING?

303
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,672
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE

304
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,674
PLEASE TELL ME WHAT IT IS I DID.

305
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,175
WELL, IF YOU DON'T KNOW, I CAN'T HELP YOU.

306
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,677
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

307
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,678
WELL, I CAN'T HELP YOU.

308
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,682

00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,184

00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,190
SO WE'RE... WE'RE GOOD?

313
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,191
UH HUH.

I'LL SEE YOU LATER, OKAY?

316
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,699

00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,706
THAT MADE YOU SO MAD AT ME?!

321
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,707
I DON'T KNOW.

322
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,709
I DON'T REMEMBER.

323
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,712
WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU CAN'T REMEMBER?

324
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,214
I WAS SO FOCUSED ON BEING MAD AT YOU

325
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,717
THAT I FORGOT WHAT IT WAS I WAS MAD ABOUT.

326
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,719
WELL, IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER

327
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,221
CAN'T WE JUST FORGET ABOUT THIS?

328
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,723
OH, NO. I AM MAD AT YOU.

329
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,224
I KNOW THAT MUCH.

330
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,226
BUT I AM SORRY ABOUT THE "FAT ASS" THING

331
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,730
BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY SWEET LITTLE HEINIE.

332
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,740
MAN, I'M GETTING PRETTY TIRED.

333
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,242
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE OVER SOON.

334
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,745
WE'VE BEEN DRIVING FOR A HALF HOUR...

335
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,747
AND YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE ROAD ONCE.

336
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,749
DON'T WORRY. IT'S OUT THERE.

337
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,752
MAYBE I JUST NEED LUNCH.

338
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,753
YEAH.

339
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,254
YOU WANT TO EAT?

340
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,256
MY TREAT.

341
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,259
ISN'T THAT ROSS' MONEY?

342
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,262
YEAH, OKAY, ROSS' TREAT.

343
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,764
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO EAT?

344
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:45,765
I DON'T KNOW.

345
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,266
OH, HEY.

346
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,267
I KNOW HOW WE CAN DECIDE.

347
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,269
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS

348
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,271
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO ANSWER REAL FAST, OKAY?

349
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,773
SO, CLEAR YOUR MIND.

350
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,775
CLEAR IT RIGHT OUT. CLEAR IT OUT. CLEAR.

351
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,776
OKAY.

352
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,277
OKAY, IT'S ALL CLEAR

353
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,280
EXCEPT FOR THIS IMAGE OF A SMALL, PURPLE LAMP.

354
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,783
IS IT ALL RIGHT IF THAT STAYS IN THERE?

355
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,284
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.

356
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,786
YEAH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

357
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,288
ALL RIGHT, YOU HAVE TO ANSWER.

358
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,291
THE FIRST THING THAT POPS INTO YOUR HEAD.

359
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,794
OKAY, WOULD YOU RATHER BE TOO WET OR TOO DRY? TOO DRY.

360
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,295
DO YOU BELIEVE IN GHOSTS? YES OR NO. NO.

361
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,798
IS THE MOVIE GOING TO BE MY BIG BREAK? NO.

362
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,800
WHAT?

363
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,802
YES.

364
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,803
DUDE, YOU SAID NO.

365
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,304
WELL, I ALSO SAID YES.

366
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,305
WELL, YOU DON'T THINK

367
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,307
THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG BREAK FOR ME?

368
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,308
NO...

369
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,310

370
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,812
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

371
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,313
LOOK, JOE, I JUST...

372
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,314
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU

373
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,817
TO GET YOUR HOPES UP TOO HIGH, YOU KNOW?

374
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,318
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

375
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,320
I'M THE LEAD IN A MOVIE.

376
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,822
THEY'RE NOT EVEN PAYING YOU.

377
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,324
THIS DOESN'T EVEN SOUND LIKE A REAL MOVIE.

378
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,826
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T NEED THIS, OKAY?

379
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,828
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE DUMPING ALL OVER MY BIG BREAK.

380
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,831
BECAUSE, JOE, I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE YOUR BIG BREAK.

381
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,332
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE ON THIS TRIP, HUH?

382
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,834
TO MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A LOSER?

383
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,836
BECAUSE IF IT IS, I'LL TELL YOU, I'D RATHER BE ALONE.

384
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:57,837
OH, YOU DON'T WANT ME ON THE TRIP.

385
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,338
NOT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIKE THIS.

386
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,339
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

387
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,842
THE NEXT TIME YOU ASK ME A QUESTION LIKE THAT, I'LL LIE.

388
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,343
YEAH, I DON'T WANT YOU ON THE TRIP.

389
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,845
ALL RIGHT, FINE, FINE.

390
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,847
WHY DON'T YOU PULL OVER? I'LL GET OUT RIGHT NOW.

391
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,348
FINE.

392
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,351
GET OUT.

393
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,353
YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO STOP ON A BRIDGE.

394
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,354
GET OUT!

395
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,856
ALL RIGHT!

396
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,861
 WAIT! WAIT! THERE'S NO SIDEWALK!

397
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,363
YEAH, I'M GOING TO DIE HERE.

398
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,369
OKAY, ARE YOU MADE AT ME BECAUSE MY HAIR GEL SMELLS?

399
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,370
NO.

400
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,373
ARE YOU ANGRY WITH ME BECAUSE I SAID

401
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,876
YOUR HANDWRITING IS CHILD LIKE?

402
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,378
NO. THAT MADE ME FEEL PRECIOUS.

403
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,380
OH, I KNOW.

404
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,883
IS IT BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS CORRECTING PEOPLE'S GRAMMAR?

405
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,384
"WHOM. WHOM."

406
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,385
SOMETIMES IT'S "WHO."

407
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,888
YEAH? SOMETIMES IT'S...

408
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,393
OH, DID YOU BEAT HIM AT A BOARD GAME?

409
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,896
HE TURNS INTO SUCH A BABY WHEN HE STARTS TO LOSE.

410
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,898
OH, YEAH, I'M THE BABY.

411
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,900
HEY, STOP IT!

412
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,401
HEY.

413
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,903
CHANDLER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

414
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,404
JOEY KICKED ME OUT OF THE CAR

415
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,906
ON THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE.

416
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,907
WHY? WHY?

417
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,408
HE WENT CRAZY.

418
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,410
WE WERE PLAYING THAT GAME WHERE YOU ASK A QUESTION

419
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,912
AND YOU HAVE TO ANSWER REALLY FAST.

420
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,415
OH, THAT GAME SHOULD NOT BE PLAYED WITHOUT MY SUPERVISION.

421
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,418
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE HIM SO MAD.

422
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,920
ALL I SAID WAS THAT I DIDN'T THINK

423
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,922
THIS WAS GOING TO BE HIS BIG BREAK.

424
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,424
THAT THIS MOVIE WASN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING FOR HIM

425
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,426
AND THAT IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE A REAL MOVIE.

426
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,929
OKAY, HE SHOULD HAVE PUSHED ME OFF THE BRIDGE.

427
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,430
WHAT'S IN THE BAG?

428
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,432
OH, I FIGURED YOU GUYS WOULD ALL BE MAD AT ME

429
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,435
SO I GOT YOU SOME GIFTS THAT I FOUND ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

430
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,437
WHO WANTS THE TEDDY BEAR WITH ONE LEG?

431
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,438
I DO.

432
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,944
OKAY...

433
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,949
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

434
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,450
OKAY, THEN YOU KNOW WHAT? HELP ME. I NEED HELP.

435
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,451
I CAN'T DO THIS.

436
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,953
OKAY, COME ON, LET'S DO IT.

437
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:54,954
ALL RIGHT.

438
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,455
SIT DOWN.

439
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,957
ALL RIGHT, PUT YOUR HEAD BACK.

440
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:58,958
YES.

441
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,459
ALL RIGHT, NOW OPEN YOUR EYES.

442
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,962
OKAY, THEY ARE.

443
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,965
HOW MANY FINGERS AM I HOLDING UP?

444
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,966
FOUR.

445
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,467
OH, MY GOD, I WAS THINKING FOUR.

446
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,468
REALLY?

447
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,970
YES!

448
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,471
YOU KNOW WHAT?

449
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,973
WHY DON'T WE START WITH A PRACTICE ONE, OKAY?

450
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:14,974
NO DROPS.

451
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,475
GREAT.

452
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,977
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ON THREE.

453
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,479
ONE... TWO... THREE.

454
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,983
MY PILLOW'S ALL WET.

455
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,985
WELL, YOU SAID IT WAS PRACTICE.

456
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,486
THEN WHY DID YOU MOVE?

457
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,988
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU WERE LYING.

458
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,990
ALL RIGHT, COME HERE.

459
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,491
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

460
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,993
GET... JUST GET...

461
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:34,994
MONICA, STOP IT!

462
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,995
OH, MY GOD! STOP IT!

463
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:36,996
I AM GOING...

464
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,997
TURN IT OVER!

465
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,498
NO!

466
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,001
I AM... I AM GOING TO GET...

467
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,004
GET THESE DROPS IN YOUR EYES.

468
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,005
OH, MY GOD!

469
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,507
YOU REALLY ARE FREAKISHLY STRONG.

470
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,009

471
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,012
MONICA, STOP IT!

472
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,513

473
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,015
DAMN! IT'S EMPTY!

474
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,517
WELL, IF JOEY AND CHANDLER WALKED IN RIGHT NOW

475
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,519
WE COULD MAKE A FORTUNE.

476
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,026

477
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,028
OH, THAT IS DEFINITELY CHANDLER, JOEY OR ROSS...

478
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,529
OR RACHEL.

479
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,534
HELLO. IT'S JOEY.

480
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,037
I'M SO GLAD YOU CALLED.

481
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,039
CHANDLER TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED.

482
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,540
YOU KNOW, HE'S REALLY UPSET ABOUT IT.

483
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,544
NOT AS UPSET AS HE'S GOING TO BE WHEN HE FINDS OUT WHAT I DID

484
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,545
WITH HIS SWEATER VESTS.

485
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,049
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIS SWEATER VESTS?

486
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,052
LET'S JUST SAY THERE'S A WELL DRESSED PACK OF DOGS

487
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,553
in Ohio.

488
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,055
Hey, Monica, is Phoebe there?

489
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,557
I GOT TO ASK HER SOMETHING ABOUT THE CAR.

490
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,060
Yeah, she's here. Hold on one second.

491
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,061
HEY, DUDE.

492
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,562
Hey, Pheebs.

493
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,065
THIS BOX KEEPS SLIDING OUT FROM UNDER THE SEAT.

494
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,066
WHAT IS IT?

495
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,067
OH, THAT'S MY GRANDMA.

496
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,571
AND THANKS, JOEY.

497
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,573
SHE'S HAVING A REALLY GREAT TIME.

498
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,577
IS THAT JOEY? IS THAT JOEY?

499
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,578
LET ME TALK TO HIM.

500
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,080
OKAY, JOEY, CHANDLER'S HERE.

501
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,581
HE WAS WONDERING IF...

502
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,084
OKAY, I GUESS HE RAN OUT OF CHANGE.

503
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,586
YOU KNOW, HE WON'T EVEN TALK TO ME.

504
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,088
HOW AM I GOING TO APOLOGIZE TO HIM.

505
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,089
IF HE WON'T EVEN TALK TO ME?

506
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,591
MAYBE YOU SHOULD SEND HIM SOMETHING.

507
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,093
SO WHEN HE GETS TO LAS VEGAS

508
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,594
HE'LL KNOW THAT YOU'RE SORRY.

509
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,096
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

510
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,598
I WONDER WHERE I COULD GET A BASKET OF PORN?

511
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,601
OH, NO, NO, DON'T SAY "I'M SORRY" WITH PORN.

512
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,103
NO?

513
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,604
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD SEND HIM--

514
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,106
A CARTON OF CIGARETTES.

515
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,109
BECAUSE THAT WAY HE CAN TRADE IT FOR PROTECTION...

516
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,110
NO, THAT'S PRISON.

517
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,112

518
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,116
OKAY, PHEEBS, I KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

519
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,617
OKAY, CLEAR YOUR MIND

520
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,621
AND ANSWER THE FIRST THING THAT COMES INTO YOUR HEAD, OKAY?

521
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,123
MM HMM.

522
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,125
WHAT DO YOU LIKE BETTER, FLORA OR FAUNA?

523
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,127
FAUNA. WHO WOULD YOU RATHER BE, SIMON OR GARFUNKEL?

524
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,128
GARFUNKEL.

525
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,129
WHY ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

526
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,130
YOU SAID I WAS BORING.

527
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,132
OH.

528
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,634
WHEN DID I SAY YOU WERE BORING?

529
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,136
OH, MY GOD! I REMEMBER NOW!

530
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,637
WE WERE PLAYING CHESS.

531
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,141
PHOEBE, YOU AND I HAVE NEVER PLAYED CHESS.

532
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,142
OH, COME ON, YES.

533
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,144
REMEMBER THAT TIME ON THE FROZEN LAKE

534
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,645
WE WERE PLAYING CHESS.

535
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,646
YOU SAID I WAS BORING

536
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,149
AND THEN YOU TOOK OFF YOUR ENERGY MASK

537
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,650
AND YOU WERE CAMERON DIAZ.

538
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,156
OKAY, THERE'S A CHANCE THIS MAY HAVE BEEN A DREAM.

539
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,662
SO, THIS ENTIRE TIME, YOU'VE BEEN ANGRY WITH ME

540
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,664
BECAUSE OF A DREAM?

541
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,167
WELL, GUESS WHAT, PHOEBE.

542
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,668
NOW I'M MAD AT YOU.

543
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,671
OW!

544
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,673
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WASN'T A DREAM.

545
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,176
OTHERWISE WE'RE JUST WASTING EACH OTHER'S TIME.

546
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,186
?? I'VE BEEN THROUGH THE DESERT ON A HORSE WITH NO NAME ??

547
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:51,190
?? IT FELT GOOD TO BE OUT OF THE RAIN ??

548
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,192
?? IN THE DESERT ??

549
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,194
??
?? YOU CAN'T REMEMBER YOUR NAME

550
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:59,198
?? BECAUSE THERE AIN'T NO ONE FOR TO GIVE YOU NO PAIN ??

551
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:03,702
?
?? LA LA LA LA LA LA LA... ?

552
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,705
HEY.

553
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,207
STANLEY!

554
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,708
HEY HEY!

555
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,210
YOUR LEADING MAN IS HERE.

556
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,711
LET'S GET TO WORK.

557
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,213
UM... SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLANS.

558
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,714
WE'VE SHUT DOWN.

559
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,216
WHA... WHAT?

560
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,217

561
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,218
IT'S A MONEY THING.

562
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,719
WE DON'T HAVE ANY.

563
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,722

564
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,224
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,725
WHAT? NO.

566
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,727
IT'S PROBABLY JUST TEMPORARY.

567
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,230
WE'RE HOPING TO GET SOME MORE MONEY SOON.

568
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,232
SO IF YOU COULD JUST HANG OUT.

569
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,233
HANG OUT?

00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,736
I DON'T KNOW-- A WEEK, MAYBE TWO.

572
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,238
THE MONEY WILL TURN UP.

573
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,240
PEOPLE ALWAYS WANT TO INVEST IN MOVIES.

574
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,741
HEY, YOU'RE NOT RICH, ARE YOU?

575
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,242

576
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,743
