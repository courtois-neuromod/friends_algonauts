00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,007
IS THE DAY EMILY GETS MARRIED AGAIN

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,008
SO, WHATEVER WE DO

5
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,010
JUST TRY TO REALLY KEEP ROSS' MIND OFF OF IT.

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,011
OH, YEAH, GOOD IDEA.

7
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,014
HEY, MAN, WHAT'S UP?

00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,039
I WAS OUT WITH GARY.

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,541
HE LET ME RIDE AROUND WITH HIM IN HIS COP CAR.

20
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,543
WE SAW AND PREVENTED CRIMES.

21
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,045

00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,046

00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,186
OH, EVERYTHING IS JUST FALLING APART.

79
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,189

YOU GET ALL THE MARGARITA STUFF READY.

82
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,194
HIS KEYS ARE IN THE DRAWER.

83
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,196
YOU KNOW WHAT? ALSO, I NEED SOME CASH.

84
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,697
YOU WANT ME TO STOP AT THE A.T.M.?

85
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,201
NO. WHILE YOU'RE AT ROSS', IF YOU SEE ANY LYING AROUND.

86
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,703

00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,706

00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:40,720
THAT WAS SO COOL, MAN, THAT WAY YOU LEANED ON THAT GUY.

89
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,224
IT IS STARTING TO GET DARK OUT THERE.

90
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,225
HE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING.

91
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,227
I MEAN, YOU TOTALLY CRACKED HIM.

92
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,728
YEAH, WELL, BEING TH AT HE WAS THE VICTIM--

93
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,730
THEY'RE USUALLY PRETTY TALKATIVE.

94
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,234
OKAY, BUT IT IS OFFICIALLY NIGHTTIME.

95
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,737
ALL RIGHT, GARY, DO YOU WANT ME TO GRAB THE BERRY FOR YOU?

96
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,738

I GOT IT.

101
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,252
THIS PLACE MAKES THE BEST SANDWICH IN THE WORLD.

102
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,254
HEY, JOE, DOES IT HAVE MEATBALLS ON IT?

103
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,755

YEAH, OKAY.

108
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:28,268
EVEN THOUGH MY TAX DOLLARS PAID FOR THIS CAR.

WOW, THAT SANDWICH REALLY DOES SMELL GOOD.

00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,785
DID I SAY YOU COULD SMELL IT?

113
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,288
I CAN'T SMELL YOUR SANDWICH?

114
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,290
HALF THE TASTE IS IN THE SMELL.

115
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,293
YOU'RE SUCKING UP ALL THE TASTE UNITS.

116
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,794
OKAY, I'LL GIVE THEM BACK.

117
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,296

00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,800
WHAT IS SO GREAT ABOUT THAT SANDWICH?

OKAY.

121
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,806

00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,849
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

134
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,851
I need a few more things to make the margaritas.

135
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:57,357
UM, I NEED SOME, UH, SOME SALT, SOME MARGARITA MIX, AND TEQUILA.

00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,875

141
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,876
Hello, Ross?

142
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,878
It's Emily here.

143
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,880
I know this is out of the blue, but, um

144
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,882
I'm getting married tomorrow.

145
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,385
Well... maybe I am.

146
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,387
I keep thinking about you

147
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,390
and I'm wondering if we made a mistake

148
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,391
giving up so fast.

149
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,393
Are you thinking about me?

150
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,395
No, of course you're not.

151
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,397
But if you are, call me tonight.

152
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,398
Okay, bye.

153
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,401
OH! OH!

 SO, WHERE WE GOING NEXT?

155
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,410

00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,418
COME ON, MAN.

161
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,422
SO, YOU GOING TO SQUEEZE THE PERP'S SHOES A LITTLE BIT

162
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,923
BEFORE HE LAWYERS UP?

163
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,426
IT'S A WITNESS, NOT A PERP , AND NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT.

164
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,430
YEAH, NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT.

I'M GARY'S PARTNER.

171
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,943
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU SAY "PARTNER"

172
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,445
IT DOESN'T SOUND COP.

173
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,447
IT SOUNDS GAY.

174
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,950
UM... JEALOUS.

175
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,452
HEY, DO YOU MIND?

I KNOW.

193
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,998
WELL, THANK GOD YOU WERE HERE.

194
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,001
I MEAN, WE HAVE TO ERASE THAT.

195
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,003
WHAT? WE CAN'T DO THAT.

196
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,505
WE HAVE TO.

197
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,507
WHAT IF ROSS HEARS THAT, AND THEN CALLS HER BACK

198
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,508
AND THEN THEY  GET BACK TOGETHER?

199
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,009
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT--

200
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,511
ROSS BACK WITH THAT CONTROLLING

201
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,013
NEUROTIC, CRAZY EMILY?

202
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,515
THE EMILY THAT WOULDN'T LET HIM SEE YOU?

203
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,518
NO! OH, NO. NO. GOD, NO.

204
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,520
HE SHOULD NOT GET BACK TOGETHER WITH HER.

205
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,522
I MEAN, I KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW THAT

206
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,023
EVEN ROSS KNOWS THAT.

207
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,026
BUT THAT STILL DOESN'T GIVE US THE RIGHT TO ERASE HIS MESSAGE.

208
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,028
LOOK, I'M HIS SISTER, OKAY? AND I LOVE HIM.

209
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,030
I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM GET HURT.

210
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,031
COME ON, DOESN'T THAT

211
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,033
GIVE ME THE RIGHT TO CONTROL HIM...?

212
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,037
HELP HIM?

213
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,040
I DON'T THINK HE'S THE ONE WHO NEEDS HELP.

214
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,544
LOOK. SHE'S OBVIOUSLY UNSTABLE, OKAY?

215
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,547
SHE'S THINKING ABOUT RUNNING OUT ON HER WEDDING DAY.

216
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,052
OKAY, FINE.

217
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,555
BUT LOOK AT THE POSITION SHE'S PUTTING HIM IN.

218
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,056
WHAT'S HE'S GOING TO DO?

219
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,059
ROSS IS GOING TO RUN OVER THERE ON THE WEDDING DAY

220
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,061
AND BREAK  UP THE MARRIAGE?

221
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,563
WHO WOULD DO THAT?

222
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,067
OKAY, FINE. ALL RIGHT?

223
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,570
BUT, THAT'S, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS DIFFERENT.

224
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,573
ALTHOUGH IT DID INVOLVE A LOT OF THE SAME PEOPLE.

225
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,574
OH...!

226
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,575
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY

227
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,077
SOME TWISTED JOKE SHE'S TRYING TO PLAY ON HIM.

228
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,579
OKAY, YOU ARE CRAZY.

229
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,581
I'M SORRY, BUT SHE SOUNDED GENUINELY UPSET.

230
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,082
I MEAN, LISTEN.

231
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,084
Your messages have been erased.

232
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,588
NO!

233
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,590
WELL, THAT WORKED OUT WELL.

234
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,091
MARGARITA?

235
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,599
OKAY, BUT, YOU KNOW, W WE'RE SAFE, RIGHT?

236
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,601
I MEAN, NOTHING BAD IS GOING TOGO DOWN?

237
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,602
 NO.

238
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,103
BUT THAT REMINDS ME-- SIGN THIS.

239
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,104
WHAT IS IT?

240
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,105
IT'S NOTHING.

241
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,607
IT SAYS YOU CAN'T SUE THE CITY

242
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,608
IF YOU SCRAPE YOUR KNEE

243
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,109
OR, YOU KNOW, GET YOUR HEAD BLOWN OFF.

244
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,613
OH, HURRY UP.

245
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,615
I WANT TO SIGN THAT.

246
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,116
OKAY, HERE HE COMES.

247
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,619
 WHAT IS HE DOING?

248
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,620
WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING?

249
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,622
WHAT IS IT? IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

250
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,623
WHAT'S GOING ON?

251
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,625
OKAY, HE SEES US. DON'T MOVE.

252
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,627
AND DON'T LOOK AT HIM.

253
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,129

254
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,142
HEY, IT'S OKAY.

255
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,645
IT WAS JUST A CAR BACKFIRE.

256
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,146
HEY, LOOK AT THAT.

257
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,148
YOU TRIED TO SAVE YOUR BUDDY.

258
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,651
YOU SEE THAT?

259
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,653
YOU SEE WHAT HE DID?

260
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,155
YOU OKAY, MAN?

261
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,158
UH HUH.

262
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,660
THANKS, JOEY.

263
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,163
UH, HELLO!

264
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,668
WHAT?

265
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,671
YOU ALL RIGHT?

266
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,176
I GUESS WE SHOULD GO.

267
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,678
NO. WAIT, WAIT.

268
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,680
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

269
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,181
NO. MONICA...

270
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,684
MONICA, WE HAVE TO FIX THIS.

271
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,685
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.

272
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,186
YOU'VE ERASED THE MESSAGE.

273
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,189
YEAH, BUT MAYBE I COULD CALL HIS MACHINE

274
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,191
AND RE CREATE THE MESSAGE.

275
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,693
RIGHT? OKAY. UM...

276
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,196
HELLO, ROSS. THIS IS RACHEL... EMILY!

277
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,698
WOW. GOD!

278
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,701
WHAT IS IT WITH THOSE TWO NAMES?

279
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,203
UH... I JUST WANTED TO SAY

280
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,707
THAT I'M GOING TO BE GETTING MARRIED

281
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,210
TO... ANOTHER BRITISH PERSON...

282
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,714
AND, UM... I'M... I'M HAVING DOUBTS

283
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,215
AND SCONES AND...

284
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,217
OH, STOP IT!

285
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,219
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT SHE SAID.

286
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,722
YEAH,THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PLAN.

287
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,223
ALL RIGHT, RACHEL, COME ON . THE MESSAGE IS ERASED.

288
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,725
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.

289
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,727
HE'S NEVER GOING TO FIND OUT ABOUT IT.

290
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,729
I COULD TELL HIM ABOUT IT.

291
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,231
LOOK, IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE TOTALLY RATIONAL ABOUT THIS

292
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,232
I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU.

293
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,234
ALL RIGHT?

294
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,736
FINE. IF YOU WANT TO TELL HIM, TELL HIM.

295
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,738
I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE A PART OF IT.

296
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,239

297
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,241
OH! MAYBE THAT'S EMILY CALLING BACK

298
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,744
TO LEAVE THE EXACT SAME MESSAGE.

299
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,746
 Hey, Ross, it's you.

300
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,248
I just want you to remember this feeling.

301
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,752
You are lucky to be alive

302
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,255
so live every day to the fullest.

303
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,258
Love yourself, okay? Okay.

304
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,761
Oh, and also, get stamps. Bye.

305
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,264
WOW. PLAY THAT MESSAGE FOR EMILY

306
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,266
AND THIS WHOLE PROBLEM GOES AWAY.

307
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,768
OH, RIGHT.

308
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,771
HEY, ANYBODY WANT TO MEET A HERO?

309
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,273
JOHN GLENN IS HERE?

310
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,275
NO. JOEY.

311
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,277
JOEY'S NEVER BEEN IN OUTER SPACE.

312
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,280
PHEEBS, WE HAD THE MOST INCREDIBLE NIGHT.

313
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,782
OKAY, SO, WE'RE IN THE CAR...

314
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,283
WAIT, HOLD ON.

315
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,287
HI. HI.

316
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,290
OKAY, GO AHEAD.

317
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,291
OKAY, OKAY

318
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,793
SO WE'RE IN THE CAR, RIGHT?

319
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,794
AND BANG! A SHOT WAS FIRED

320
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,798
AND JOEY, WITH NO REGARD FOR HIS OWN SAFETY

321
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,800
THROWS HIMSELF ON ME.

322
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,301
MY GOD, JOEY.

323
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,805
IT WAS A CAR BACKFIRE.

324
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,306
YEAH, BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

325
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,808
YEAH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

326
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,813
AND IT COULD HAVE JUST AS EASILY HAVE BEEN A BULLET.

327
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,815
HEY, JOEY, EVER THINK ABOUT JOINING THE FORCE?

328
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,816
WE COULD USE A GUY LIKE YOU.

329
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,318
WHO JUMPS AT LOUD NOISES.

330
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,321
WOW.

331
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,323
I COULD HAVE DIED TONIGHT.

332
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,326
YEAH, IF THE CAR THAT BACKFIRED HAD RUN OVER YOU.

333
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,828
YOU KNOW WHAT?

334
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,830
I'M GOING TO GO HOME BEFORE ROSS STARTS RAMBLING

335
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,832
ABOUT HIS NEWFOUND RESPECT FOR LIFE.

336
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,836
I DO HAVE A NEWFOUND RESPECT FOR LIFE.

337
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,338
OH, MY GOD.

338
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,842
ROSS, I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU

339
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,343
YOU WEREN'T GO ING TO DIE TODAY.

340
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,346
WHAT? YOU KNOW WHEN I'M GOING TO DIE?

341
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,352
SWEETHEART, YOU WANT TO GET SOME DINNER?

342
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,354
SURE. YEAH.

343
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,856
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

344
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,359
IF I HEARD A SHOT RIGHT NOW, I'D THROW MY BODY ON YOU.

345
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,861
OH, YEAH? WELL , MAYBE YOU AND I

346
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,863
SHOULD TAKE A WALK IN A BAD NEIGHBORHOOD.

347
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,865
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

348
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,366
BYE.

349
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,868
BYE. BYE.

350
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,372
CUT IT OUT, ROSS.

351
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,374
I'D HATE TO HAVE TO SAVE YOUR LIFE

352
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,376
AND KICK YOUR  ASS IN THE SAME DAY.

353
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,386
DUDE?

354
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,889
HOW COME YOU TOOK OFF?

355
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,391
OH, JUST GOING FOR A WALK.

356
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,394
AROUND THE LIVING ROOM. WHATEVER.

357
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,896
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

358
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,899
NO. NO, I'M JUST TIRED.

359
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,400
YOU KNOW, FROM THE WALK.

360
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,403
OH. OKAY.

361
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,405
YOU DOVE IN FRONT OF ROSS.

362
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,408
ROSS.

363
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,911
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

364
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,916
OH, MY GOD. YOU HATE ROSS.

365
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,918
I DON'T HATE ROSS.

366
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:19,919
OF COURSE YOU DO.

367
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,420
I SAVED HIM. YOU'RE MAD AT ME.

368
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,422
IT ALL ADDS UP.

369
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,425
YOU WANT ROSS  OUT OF THE PICTURE.

370
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,927
WHAT PICTURE?

371
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,929
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I DON'T LIKE WHAT I'M HEARING.

372
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,932
LOOK, I'M VERY GLAD THAT YOU SAVED ROSS FROM THE CAR BACKFIRE

373
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,934
BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN A BULLET

374
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,936
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU DIDN'T TRY TO SAVE ME.

375
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,938
OH.

376
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,441
YOU'RE UPSET BECAUSE YOU THINK I CHOSE ROSS OVER YOU.

377
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,946
NO. I KNEW YOU COULD TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

378
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,947
YOU KNOW?

379
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,448
I MEAN, ROSS, HE NEEDS HELP.

380
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:50,950
HE'S NOT STREET LIKE US.

381
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,451
WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO

382
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,453
IS YOU WOULD RISK YOUR LIFE FOR ROSS

383
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,454
BEFORE YOU WOULD FOR ME.

384
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,956
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.

385
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,959
N NO, NOT EXACTLY.

386
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,460
ALL RIGHT, LOOK. I...

387
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,964
I WASN'T TRYING TO SAVE ROSS

388
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,966
OKAY?

389
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,969
MY SANDWICH WAS NEXT TO ROSS.

390
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,473
ALL RIGHT?

391
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,476
I WA... I WAS TRYING TO SAVE MY SANDWICH.

392
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,981
FROM A BULLET?

393
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,483
I KNOW IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE.

394
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,485
MUCH SENSE?

395
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,487
CHANDLER, IT WAS INSTINCT, OKAY?

396
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,488
I JUST WENT FOR IT.

397
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,991
SO YOU RISKED YOUR LIFE FOR A SANDWICH?

398
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,494
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT, CHANDLER

399
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:39,498
THIS IS THE GREATEST SANDWICH  IN THE WORLD.

400
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,003
SO YOU DIDN'T, UH, CHOOSE ROSS BEFORE ME?

401
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,505
NO. I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

402
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,008
YOU'RE LIKE MY BROTHER.

403
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,509
REALLY?

404
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,511
YEAH. IN FACT

405
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,015
TO PROVE HOW MUCH YOU MEAN TO ME...

406
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,021
HERE.

407
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,023
THANKS.

408
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,025
WHOA! EASY. IT'S NOT A HOT DOG.

409
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,033
HOW GOOD IS THAT?

410
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,535
OH, YEAH.

411
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,536
SEE? MM HMM.

412
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,538
OH, DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

413
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,542
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SHOWING ME HOW MUCH I MEAN TO YOU.

414
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,544
YEAH. WITH A BITE.

415
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,546
GEEZ!

416
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,555

417
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,564
HEY, HI.

418
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,066
RACH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

419
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,567
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

420
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,570
YOU ARE IN OUR APARTMENT ALL THE TIME, OKAY?

421
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,573
THIS IS JUST A DROP IN THE BUCKET, MISTER.

422
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,076
YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

423
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,079
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU'RE HERE.

424
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,082
YOU'RE MY FRIEND, AND YOU'RE HERE.

425
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,089
HUH. OKAY. JUST A LITTLE SCARED.

426
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,091
WHAT'S GOING ON, ROSS?

427
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,094
THE MOST AMAZING THING HAPPENED TONIGHT.

428
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,596
I THOUGHT MY NUMBER WAS UP.

429
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,599
I HAD AN ACTUAL NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE.

430
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,601
WHAT?! WHAT HAPPENED?

431
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,104
OKAY, OKAY, WE WERE ON THE RIDE- ALONG WITH GARY, RIGHT?

432
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,605
AND SOMEBODY TOOK A SHOT AT ME.

433
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,107

434
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,110
REALLY?

435
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,112
NO, A CAR BACKFIRED, BUT...

436
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,618
I THOUGHT SOMEBODY WAS TAKING A SHOT AT ME

437
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,620
AND, RACH, I, I SURVIVED.

438
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,122
AND I WAS FILLED WITH

439
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,125
THIS, THIS GREAT RESPECT FOR LIFE.

440
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:50,129
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO EXPERIENCE EVERY MOMENT.

441
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,132
I WANT TO SEIZE EVERY OPPORTUNITY.

442
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,136
I AM SEEING EVERYTHING SO, SO CLEARLY NOW.

443
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,638
BECAUSE A CAR BACKFIRED?

444
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,641
OKAY, WHY ARE YOU HERE?

445
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:07,646
WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS FITS INTO YOUR WHOLE SEIZING THING

446
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,149
BUT, UM, EMILY CALLED YOU TODAY.

447
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,151
YOU TALKED TO HER?

448
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,153
NO, SHE LEFT A MESSAGE.

449
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,654
BUT IT KIND OF GOT ERASED.

450
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,156
I MEAN, THERE'S...

451
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,658
SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR MACHINE.

452
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,660
OKAY, WHAT DID SHE SAY?

453
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,661
WELL, UM, SOMETHING

454
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,664
ABOUT HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT THE WEDDING

455
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:29,168
AND DID YOU GUYS MAKE A MISTAKE BREAKING UP, AND, UH...

456
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,669
SHE WANTS YOU TO CALL HER.

457
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,672
WOW.

458
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,675
NOW THAT WAS A GOOD THING THAT I TOLD YOU, RIGHT?

459
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,677
HUH? YEAH. YES.

460
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,179
OF COURSE.

461
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,180
OKAY, THANK YOU.

462
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,681
THANK YOU, BECAUSE

463
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,684
I'M GOING TO JUST GO TELL MONICA THAT I WAS RIGHT.

464
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,685
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

465
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,187
SHE DIDN'T WANT... NOT IMPORTANT.

466
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,189
THE POINT IS, I WAS RIGHT.

467
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,190
YOUR DECISION.

468
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,693
OKAY? I WAS RIGHT.

469
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,695
YOUR DECISION.

470
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,697
RIGHT.

471
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,699
I GUESS I SHOULD CALL EMILY.

472
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,702
OKAY. NO, THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT DECISION.

473
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,204
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

474
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,705
ROSS, COME ON.

475
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:10,709
I MEAN, THAT WOMAN MADE YOU MISERABLE.

476
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,711
OKAY, ROSS

477
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,214
DO YOU REALLY WANT  TO GET BACK INTO THAT?

478
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,715
OKAY, LOOK, YESTERDAY

479
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,719
I WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN CONSIDERED CALLING HER BACK

480
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,221
BUT MY EX WIFE CALLS

481
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,225
ON THE SAME DAY I HAVE A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE?

482
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,728
I MEAN, THAT'S GOT TO MEAN SOMETHING, RIGHT?

483
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,731
ROSS, THAT WAS NOT A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE.

484
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,733
THAT WAS BARELY AN EXPERIENCE.

485
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,236
YOU WEREN'T THERE.

486
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,239
OKAY, MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING

487
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,741
THAT I AM... I'M SUPPOSED TO SEIZE, YOU KNOW?

488
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,244
OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT?

489
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:49,748
MAYBE THIS IS NOT ABOUT SEIZING STUFF.

490
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:53,752
MAYBE THIS IS ABOUT ESCAPING STUFF.

491
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,754
OKAY, I MEAN , LOOK AT TODAY.

492
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,756
I MEAN, YOU ESCAPED...

493
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,258
DEATH...

494
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,260
YOU KNOW?

495
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,263
AND MAYBE THIS IS A CHANCE FOR YOU TO ESCAPE

496
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,765
GETTING BACK TOGETHER WITH EMILY.

497
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,768
THAT DOES MAKE SENSE.

498
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,770
BECAUSE I DO

499
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,773
WANT TO SEIZE SOME OPPORTUNITY

500
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:19,278
BUT I REALLY DON'T WANT TO SEE OR TALK TO HER.

501
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,781
WELL, THEN THERE YOU GO.

502
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,283
YEAH.

503
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,285
YEAH, MAYBE TODAY'S JUST...

504
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,288
CLOSE CALL DAY.

505
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,292
HEY, THANKS, RACH.

506
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,294
OH, HONEY, NO PROBLEM.

507
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,295
OKAY. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

508
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,796
THE MESSAGE IS BLINKING.

509
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,798
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T ERASE IT.

510
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,799
OH?

511
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,301
Hey, Ross, it's you.

512
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,802
OH, YEAH.

513
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,304
THAT'S AN OLD MESSAGE.

514
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,306
NOBODY NEEDS TO HEAR THAT.

515
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,810
HEY, UM, WAS MONICA HERE?

516
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,811
YEAH.

517
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,814
YEAH, I WANT MY MONEY BACK.

518
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,817
YEAH, UM, YOU PROBABLY NEED THAT FOR STAMPS, RIGHT?

519
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,326
HEY, PHEEBS...

520
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,328
HAS GARY EVER BEEN SHOT AT FOR REAL?

521
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,329
YES, ONCE.

522
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,330
YEAH.

523
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,831
A LITTLE.

524
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,334
HE KIND OF DID IT TO HIMSELF.

525
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,337
IT'S NOT REALLY A GOOD STORY.

526
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,840
I WONDER HOW I'D REACT UNDER FIRE, YOU KNOW?

527
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,343
AND NOT BACKFIRE, BUT HEAVY FIRE.

528
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,345
LIKE IF I WAS IN A WAR OR SOMETHING.

529
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,347
MAN, I WOULD BE GREAT IN A WAR.

530
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,850
I MEAN, I THINK I WOULD MAKE A FANTASTIC MILITARY LEADER.

531
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,852
I MEAN, I KNOW I WOULD MAKE GENERAL

532
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,854
BEFORE ANY OF YOU GUYS.

533
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:39,358
BEFORE OR AFTER YOU WERE SHOT BY YOUR OWN TROOPS?

534
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,859
I KNOW WHERE JOEY WOULD BE.

535
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,860
HE'D BE DOWN IN THE FOXHOLE

536
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,362
PROTECTING ALL OF US.

537
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,865
YES, IF THE FOXHOLE WAS LINED WITH SANDWICHES.

538
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,868
YEAH, HERO SANDWICHES.

539
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,872
YOU ALL KNOW THAT I'M A PACIFIST

540
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,874
SO I'M NOT INTERESTED IN WAR IN ANY WAY.

541
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,376
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

542
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,379
WHEN THE REVOLUTION COMES, I WILL HAVE TO DESTROY YOU ALL.

543
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,881
NOT YOU, JOEY.
