1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,005

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,509
OH, MONICA, THAT WAS THE BEST

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,011
THANKSGIVING DINNER EVER.

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,012
IT WAS SO GOOD.

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,513
I THINK YOU KILLED US.

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,517
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY EAT ANOTHER BITE.

7
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:21,021
I NEED SOMETHING SWEET.

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,023
DOES ANYONE WANT TO WATCH TV?

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,024
 YEAH.

10
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,029
MONICA, YOUR REMOTE DOESN'T WORK.

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,032
PHOEBE, YOU HAVE TO LIFT IT AND POINT.

12
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,533
OH.

13
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:37,037
OH, FORGET IT.

14
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,538
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD ALL DO?

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,040
WE SHOULD PLAY THAT GAME

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,542
WHERE EVERYONE SAYS ONE THING THAT THEY'RE THANKFUL FOR.

17
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,544
OH, I... I AM THANKFUL

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,547
FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL FALL WE'VE BEEN HAVING.

19
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,549
THAT'S SWEET, JOEY. VERY NICE.

20
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,052
YEAH, THE OTHER DAY I WAS AT THE BUS STOP

21
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,554
AND THIS LOVELY FALL BREEZE CAME IN OUT OF NOWHERE

22
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,556
AND BLEW THIS CHICK'S SKIRT RIGHT UP.

23
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,060
OH, WHICH REMINDS ME

24
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,562
I'M ALSO THANKFUL FOR THONGS.

37
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,112
 I MEAN, IT'S NOT

38
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,615
SO MUCH AN UNDERPANT AS IT IS A FEAT OF ENGINEERING.

39
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,118
IT'S AMAZING

40
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,620
HOW MUCH THEY CAN DO WITH SO LITTLE MATERIAL

41
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,123
YOU KNOW, AND THE WAY THEY PLAY WITH YOUR MIND.

42
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,625
I MEAN, IS IT THERE? IS IT NOT THERE?

43
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,626

44
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:10,130
ARE YOU AWARE THAT YOU'RE STILL TALKING?

45
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,133
IS ANYONE THANKFUL FOR ANYTHING ELSE

46
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,634
BESIDES A THONG?

47
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,136
HUH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO PICK.

48
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,637
AM I MORE THANKFUL

49
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,139
FOR MY DIVORCE OR MY EVICTION?

50
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,640
WOW. SEE, AND I DIDN'T THINK

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,642
YOU'D BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH ANYTHING.

52
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:28,148
I'M SORRY, IT'S JUST THIS IS THE WORST THANKSGIVING EVER.

53
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,650
NO, NO, NO, NO. I AM THE KING OF BAD THANKSGIVINGS.

54
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,153
YOU CAN'T JUST SWOOP IN HERE WITH YOUR BAD MARRIAGE

55
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,654
AND TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME.

56
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,656
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL THE WHOLE STORY

57
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,658
ABOUT HOW YOUR PARENTS GOT DIVORCED AGAIN, ARE YOU?

58
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,660
OH, GOD NO.

59
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,664
NO, NO, COME ON, I WANT TO HEAR IT.

60
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,168
IT WOULDN'T BE THANKSGIVING WITHOUT CHANDLER BUMMING US OUT.

61
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,171
SEE, IT'S A TRADITION LIKE THE PARADE...

62
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,174
IF THE PARADE DECIDED IT WAS GAY, MOVED OUT

63
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,176
AND ABANDONED ITS ENTIRE FAMILY.

64
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,179
NOW, CHANDLER, DEAR

65
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,181
JUST BECAUSE YOUR FATHER AND I

66
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,682
ARE GETTING A DIVORCE

67
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,684
DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T LOVE YOU.

68
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,186
IT JUST MEANS

69
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,690
HE WOULD RATHER SLEEP WITH THE HOUSEBOY THAN WITH ME.

70
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:19,199
MORE TURKEY, MR. CHANDLER?

71
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,700
EVERY TIME YOU TELL THAT STORY

72
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,203
THAT GUY'S ACCENT GETS THICKER AND THICKER.

73
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,207
SO, ARE HE AND YOUR DAD STILL TOGETHER?

74
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,209
NO, NO, NO, AFTER THEY GOT THEIR OWN PLACE

75
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,211
THE HOUSEBOY GOT HIS OWN HOUSEBOY.

76
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,214
YOU SHOULD'VE HEARD HIS ACCENT.

77
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,715
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOURS IS WORSE.

78
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,218
YOU ARE THE KING OF BAD THANKSGIVINGS.

79
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,219
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

80
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,720
I'VE GOT ONE THAT'S WORSE.

81
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,723
REALLY? WORSE THAN "MORE TURKEY, MR. CHANDLER?"

82
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,727
OH, DID THE LITTLE RICH BOY

83
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,229
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE BUTLER?

84
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,730
YES, MINE'S WORSE.

85
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,739
MORE BANDAGES! MORE BANDAGES!

86
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,743
PLEASE, CAN I GET SOME MORE BANDAGES IN HERE?!

87
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,245
THIS MAN IS DYING!

88
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,750
OH, NO.

89
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,256
IN THIS LIFE, PHOEBE.

90
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,757
OH, THIS LIFE.

91
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,260
OH, OKAY. NO, CHANDLER'S IS WORSE.

92
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,263
MAN, IT MUST BE SO COOL

93
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,764
REMEMBERING STUFF LIKE THAT.

94
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,267
I DON'T HAVE ANY PAST LIFE MEMORIES.

95
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,769
OF COURSE YOU DON'T, SWEETIE.

96
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,770
YOU'RE BRAND NEW.

97
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,275
I KNOW MONICA'S WORST THANKSGIVING.

98
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,277
LET'S NOT TELL THIS STORY.

99
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,278
OH, COME ON.

100
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,779
OH, NO. I KNOW, I KNOW.

101
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,281
IT'S THE ONE WHERE JOEY

102
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,783
GOT MONICA'S TURKEY STUCK ON HIS HEAD.

103
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,784
WHAT?

104
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:45,785
WHAT?!

105
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,788
JOEY GOT A TURKEY STUCK ON HIS HEAD?

106
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,790
HEY, IT'S NOT LIKE IT SOUNDS.

107
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,792
IT'S EXACTLY LIKE IT SOUNDS.

108
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,800
HELLO?

109
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:07,307
HELLO?

110
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,808
PHOEBE?

111
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,809
JOEY?

112
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,312
WHAT'S GOING ON?

113
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,814

114
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,316
OH, MY GOD!

115
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,817
I KNOW.

116
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,319
IT'S STUCK!

117
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,321
WELL... STEP.

118
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,324
HOW DID IT GET ONE?

119
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,327
I PUT IT ON TO SCARE CHANDLER.

120
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,828
OH, MY GOD!

121
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,830
MONICA'S GOING TO TOTALLY FREAK OUT.

122
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,832
WELL, THEN HELP ME GET IT OFF.

123
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,835
PLUS, IT SMELLS REALLY BAD IN HERE.

124
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,837
WELL, OF COURSE IT SMELLS BAD.

125
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,340
YOU HAVE YOUR HEAD UP A DEAD ANIMAL'S ASS.

126
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,843
OOH, OH. MONICA. OOH!

127
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,847
HEY.

128
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,349
HEY.

129
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,851
HEY, DID YOU GET THE TURKEY BASTE...?

130
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,852
OH. OH, MY GOD!

131
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,854
OH, MY GOD!

132
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,855
WHO IS THAT?

133
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,359
IT'S JOEY.

134
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,360
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

135
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,861
AND IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY?

136
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,863
NO, IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY.

137
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,366
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SCARY.

138
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,368
WELL, GET THAT OFF NOW.

139
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,869
I CAN'T. IT'S STUCK.

140
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,372
I DON'T CARE. THAT HAS TO FEED 20 PEOPLE AT MY PARENTS' HOUSE

141
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,874
AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO EAT IT OFF YOUR HEAD!

142
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,875
HOLD ON, OKAY?

143
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,877
LET'S JUST ALL THINK.

144
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,385
OKAY, I GOT IT.

145
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,387
PHOEBE, YOU PULL.

146
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,390
I'M GOING TO SPREAD THE LEGS AS WIDE AS I CAN.

147
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,392

148
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,393
JOEY? YEAH.

149
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,894
NOW IS NOT THE TIME.

150
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,396
SORRY. RIGHT. SORRY.

151
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,898
OKAY, NOW COUNT TO THREE.

152
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,400
ONE, TWO, THREE.

153
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,402

154
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,903
IT WORKED.

155
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,904
I SCARED YOU.

156
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,406
I KNEW IT.

157
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,407
HA HA!

158
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,410
I'M OVER HERE, BIG GUY.

159
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,911
YEAH, YOU ARE.

160
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,413
YEAH, HA HA!

161
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,415
I SCARED YOU.

162
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,417

163
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,920
YOU YOU DID LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.

164
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,922
HEY, I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE

165
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,924
WHO LOOKED LIKE AN IDIOT, ALL RIGHT?

166
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,928
REMEMBER WHEN ROSS TRIED TO SAY "BUTTERNUT SQUASH"

167
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,931
AND IT CAME OUT... "SQUATTER NUTBOSH"?

168
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,435
YEAH, THAT'S THE SAME.

169
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:18,938
WELL, THAT'S IT.

170
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,940
THAT'S MY WORST THANKSGIVING.

171
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,442
OH, WAIT. THAT CAN'T BE THE ONE

172
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,443
THAT RACHEL WAS TALKING ABOUT

173
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,945
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THAT HAPPENED.

174
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,447
SO WHAT WAS IT?

175
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,448
YEAH, WHAT WAS IT?

176
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,450
I I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TELL THIS STORY.

177
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,951
OH, COME ON, MONICA.

178
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,454
RELIVING PAST PAIN AND GETTING DEPRESSED

179
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,956
IS WHAT THANKSGIVING'S ALL ABOUT.

180
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,458
YOU KNOW, FOR ME ANYWAY.

181
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,959
AND, OF COURSE, THE INDIANS.

182
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,462
LOOK, UM, OF ALL PEOPLE

183
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,464
YOU DO NOT WANT ME TO TELL THIS STORY.

184
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,466
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

185
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,967

186
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,469
MONICA! I THINK RACHEL IS HERE.

187
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:50,970
 I'LL GET IT!

188
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,479
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

189
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,980
NOT FOR ME.

190
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,982
CHIP AND I BROKE UP.

191
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,986
WHY? WHY? WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

192
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,988
OH, YOU KNOW HOW MY PARENTS ARE OUT OF TOWN

193
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,490
AND CHIP WAS GOING TO COME OVER.

194
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,492
YEAH, YEAH, AND YOU WERE GOING

195
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,993
TO GIVE HIM, YOU KNOW...

196
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,495
YOUR FLOWER.

197
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,997
OKAY, MONICA, CAN YOU JUST CALL IT "SEX"?

198
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,000
IT REALLY CREEPS ME OUT WHEN YOU CALL IT THAT.

199
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,503
OKAY, AND BY THE WAY, WHILE WE'RE AT IT

200
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,506
A GUY'S THING IS NOT CALLED HIS "TENDERNESS."

201
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,510
BELIEVE ME.

202
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:33,513
HI.

203
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,014
HI, RACHEL.

204
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,516
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

205
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,017
HEY.

206
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,018
OH, HI.

207
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,024
UH... EVERYONE

208
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,528
THIS IS CHANDLER, MY ROOMMATE

209
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,030
AND LEAD SINGER OF OUR BAND.

210
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,534
ROSS.

211
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,536
OH, THIS IS MONICA.

212
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,038
HI, I'M ROSS'S LITTLE SISTER.

213
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,540
OKAY.

214
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,545
I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD COME, CHANDLER.

215
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,047
WE GOT PLENTY OF FOOD, SO I HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY.

216
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,550
OH, MOM, CHANDLER HATES THANKSGIVING

217
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,052
AND DOESN'T EAT ANY THANKSGIVING FOOD.

218
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,056
OH, I'M SO GLAD YOU BROUGHT HIM HERE, THEN.

219
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,559
HEY, CHANDLER, UM... IF YOU WANT, I CAN MAKE YOU

220
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,061
SOME MACARONI AND CHEESE FOR DINNER.

221
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,063
WELL, AS LONG AS THE PILGRIMS DIDN'T EAT IT, I'M IN.

222
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,065

223
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,068
DAMN IT.

224
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,578
SO, UH... RACH...

225
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:43,082
DOES IT... DOES IT FEEL WEIRD AROUND HERE NOW?

226
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,085
YOU KNOW, SINCE I'VE BEEN AWAY AT COLLEGE?

227
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,588
OH. NO, NOT REALLY.

228
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,091
WELL, THAT'S COOL.

229
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,092
SO, DO...?

230
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,596
SO THAT'S RACHEL, HUH?

231
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,598
THE GIRL YOU'VE BEEN WRITING ALL THOSE SONGS ABOUT.

232
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,099
YEAH.

233
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,101
YOU MIGHT WANT TO RETHINK

234
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:06,105
THE LYRICS TO "SHE FEELS WEIRD SINCE I'VE BEEN GONE."

235
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,608
OH!

236
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,110
I CANNOT BELIEVE CHIP DUMPED ME

237
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,113
FOR THAT SLUT NANCY BRANSON.

238
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,616
I AM NEVER GOING OUT WITH HIM AGAIN, YOU KNOW.

239
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,618
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH HE BEGS.

240
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,119
I THINK HIS BEGGING DAYS ARE OVER

241
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,621
NOW HE'S GOING OUT WITH NANCY BRANSON.

242
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,124
YOU KNOW WHAT?

243
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,627
I'VE JUST HAD IT WITH HIGH SCHOOL BOYS.

244
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,128
THEY'RE JUST... SILLY.

245
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,631
THEY'RE JUST SILLY, STUPID BOYS.

246
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,132
I'M GOING TO START DATING MEN.

247
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,135
UH, I'M SORRY, JUDY.

248
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:40,640
I COULDN'T FIND THAT BOWL YOU AND JACK WERE LOOKING FOR.

249
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,645
CALL THEM "MOM AND DAD," YOU LOSER.

250
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,648
MONICA!

251
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,154
HEY, CHANDLER...

252
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,160
DID YOU LIKE THE MACARONI AND CHEESE?

253
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,161
OH, YEAH. IT WAS GREAT.

254
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,162
YOU SHOULD BE A CHEF.

255
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,664
OKAY.

256
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,169
GUESS WHAT? ALL THAT STUFF

257
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,171
ABOUT NANCY BRANSON BEING A SLUT

258
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,173
WAS ALL A RUMOR, SO CHIP DUMPED HER

259
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,677
AND HE WANTS TO COME OVER TO MY HOUSE TONIGHT.

260
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,679
OH, THAT IS SO GREAT!

261
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,680
OH, GOSH, LIST EN.

262
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,182
IF YOU AND CHIP DO IT TONIGHT

263
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,185
PROMISE ME YOU'LL TELL ME EVERYTHING.

264
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,688
OH, TOTALLY, TOTALLY. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

265
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,189
WE ALREADY KIND OF DID IT ONCE, YOU KNOW.

266
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,691
I KNOW, BUT THIS TIME YOU'RE GOING.

267
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,693
TO DEFINITELY KNOW WHETHER OR NOT YOU DID IT.

268
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,695
I KNOW. OH, AND CHIP PROMISED

269
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,197
THAT THAT THIS TIME IT WOULD LAST

270
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,199
AT LEAST FOR AN ENTIRE SONG.

271
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,204
SO I'M THINKING OF ASK ING RACHEL OUT TONIGHT

272
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,206
YOU KNOW, MAYBE PLAYING HER THAT SONG

273
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,207
WE WROTE LAST WEEK.

274
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,208
"EMOTIONAL KNAPSACK"?

275
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,209
YEAH.

276
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,210
RIGHT ON.

277
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,212
OH, BUT DON'T TAKE TOO LONG, OKAY?

278
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,715
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO TEST OUT

279
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,718
OUR FAKE I.D.s TONIGHT, RIGHT, CLIFFORD ALVAREZ?

280
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,722
LISTEN, ROWLAND CHANG

281
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:07,226
IF THINGS GO WELL, I MAY BE OUT WITH HER ALL NIGHT.

282
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,728
DUDE, DON'T DO THAT TO ME.

283
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,729
NO, IT'S COOL.

284
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,730
YOU CAN STAY HERE.

285
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,731
MY PARENTS WON'T MIND.

286
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,232
NO, IT'S NOT THAT. I JUST DON'T WANT

287
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,234
TO BE STUCK HERE ALL NIGHT WITH YOUR FAT SISTER.

288
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,736
HEY.

289
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,742
MONICA, WHY DON'T YOU FINISH OFF THESE PIES?

290
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,244
I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE ROOM IN THE FRIDGE.

291
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,748
NO.

292
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,749
NO, THANK YOU.

293
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,251
WELL, JUDY, YOU DID IT.

294
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,754
SHE'S FINALLY FULL.

295
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,759
I CALLED YOU FAT?

296
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,260
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THAT.

297
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,762
MAYBE IT'D JOG YOUR MEMORY

298
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,765
IF YOU GUYS PLAYED A LITTLE BIT OF "EMOTIONAL KNAPSACK."

299
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,767
I'M SO SORRY.

300
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,268
I REALLY AM.

301
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,770
BUT, COME ON, I WAS AN IDIOT BACK THEN

302
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,773
I RUSHED THE STAGE AT A WHAM! CONCERT, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

303
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,777
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU CALLED HER FAT.

304
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,280
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU LET GEORGE MICHAELS SLAP YOU.

305
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,783
I AM REALLY SORRY.

306
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,284
THAT IS SO TERRIBLE.

307
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,285
I'M SO, SO SORRY.

308
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,287
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT

309
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,289
THE THANKSGIVING I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

310
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,290
YES, IT WAS.

311
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,292
NO, IT WASN'T. IT...

312
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,293
THANKSGIVING'S OVER.

313
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,795
LET'S GET READY FOR CHRISTMAS.

314
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,796
WHO WANTS TO GO GET

315
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,797
A CHRISTMAS TREE?

316
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,300
OOH, NO. I HAVE THE CUTEST CHRISTMAS STORY.

317
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,302
BUT WE WANT TO HEAR MONICA'S THANKSGIVING STORY.

318
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,303
FINE. ALL RIGHT.

319
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,306
MINE HAD A DWARF THAT GOT BROKE IN HALF

320
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,808
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.

321
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,810
SO, RACHEL, YOUR MOM TELLS ME

322
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,812
YOU CHANGED YOUR MAJOR AGAIN.

323
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,313
WELL, YEAH, I HAD TO.

324
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,316
THERE WAS NEVER ANY PARKING BY THE PSYCHOLOGY BUILDING.

325
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,818
HI, RACHEL.

326
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,819
OH, HI.

327
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,821
WOW, LOVE YOUR NEW NOSE.

328
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,822
JACK...

329
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,324
WHAT? DR. WILSON'S AN ARTIST.

330
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,827
HE REMOVED MY MOLE CLUSTER.

331
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,828
WANT TO SEE?

332
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:49,829
 I'LL GET IT.

333
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,330
NO. PLEASE LET ME.

334
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,335
HEY.

335
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,837
HEY. HEY.

336
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,341
HAPPY THANKSGIVING

337
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,843
HELLO.

338
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,845
GOD, YOUR HAIR SURE IS DIFFERENT.

339
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,847
YEAH, WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT.

340
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,349
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW STUPID WE USED TO LOOK.

341
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,350
YEAH.

342
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,354
SO, UH, WHERE'S MONICA?

343
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,856
SHE'S UPSTAIRS.

344
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,857
MONICA, COME DOWN.

345
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,358
EVERYONE'S HERE--

346
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,862
ROSS, RACHEL AND THE BOY WHO HATES THANKSGIVING.

347
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,867
HI, CHANDLER.

348
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,369
OH, MY GOD.

349
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,371
W W WHAT'S THE MATTER

350
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:36,876
IS THERE... IS THERE SOMETHING ON MY DRESS?

351
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,879
YOU LOOK SO DIFFERENT, TERRIFIC.

352
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,380
THAT DRESS, THAT BODY.

353
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,381
DUDE.

354
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,382
SORRY.

355
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,884
YES, YES.

356
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,886
MONICA IS THIN. IT'S WONDERFUL

357
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,888
BUT WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO HEAR ABOUT

358
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,890
IS ROSS'S NEW GIRLFRIEND.

359
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,891
OH, MOM.

360
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,393
OKAY. UM, HER NAME IS CAROL

361
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,897
AND SHE'S REALLY PRETTY AND SMART

362
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,900
AND, UH, SHE'S... SHE'S ON THE LACROSSE TEAM

363
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,402
AND THE GOLF TEAM, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

364
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,404
SHE PLAYS FOR BOTH TEAMS.

365
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,909
SO, CHANDLER, I GUESS I'LL SEE YOU AT DINNER.

366
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,411
DUDE.

367
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,412
SORRY.

368
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,417
OH, MY GOD. THAT WAS SO AWESOME.

369
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,920
YOU TOTALLY GOT HIM BACK FOR CALLING YOU FAT.

370
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,922
HE WAS JUST DROOLING ALL OVER YOU.

371
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,423
THAT MUST HAVE FELT SO GREAT.

372
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,424
WELL, IT DIDN'T.

373
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,425
WHAT?

374
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,428
YEAH. I MEAN, YEAH, I LOOK GREAT

NOT IN TROUBLE ANYMORE, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

377
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,937
I STILL DON'T FEEL LIKE I GOT HIM BACK, YOU KNOW?

378
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,939
I JUST WANT TO HUMILIATE HIM.

379
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,442
I WANT HIM TO BE LIKE NAKED AND I WANT TO POINT AT HIM

380
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,443
AND I WANT TO LAUGH.

381
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,948
OKAY.THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO.

382
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,950
HOW?

383
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,952
WELL, GUYS TEND TO GET NAKED

384
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,954
BEFORE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE SEX.

385
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,955
WHAT?!

386
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,958
I DIDN'T WORK THIS HARD A A AND LOSE ALL THIS WEIGHT

387
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,461
JUST SO I COULD GIVE MY FLOWER TO SOMEONE LIKE HIM.

388
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,463
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, IF YOU KEEP CALLING IT THAT

389
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,965
NO ONE'S EVER GOING TO TAKE IT.

390
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,466
ALL AND THEN, SECOND OF

391
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,969
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ACTUALLY HAVE SEX WITH HIM.

392
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,471
YOU'RE JUST GO ING TO MAKE HIM THINK THAT YOU ARE.

393
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,473
YEAH.

394
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,975
YEAH, AND THEN WHEN HE'S NAKED

395
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,977
I CAN THROW HIM OUT IN THE FRONT YARD

396
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,479
AND LOCK THE DOOR, AND THEN ALL THE NEIGHBORS

397
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,981
WILL JUST HUMILIATE HIM.

398
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,483
YEAH, AND THEN YOU WILL DEFINITELY GET HIM BACK.

399
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,986
HOW DO I MAKE HIM THINK I WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH HIM?

400
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,988
UH, HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

401
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:33,993
JUST ACT LIKE EVERYTHING AROUND YOU TURNS YOU ON.

402
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,496
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

403
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,999

THIS FEELS SO GOOD AGAINST MY CHEEK.

407
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,512
AND IF I GET A LITTLE HOT, I CAN JUST DAB MYSELF WITH IT.

408
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,514
OR I CAN BRING IT DOWN TO MY SIDE

409
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,017
AND MAYBE RUN IT THROUGH MY FINGERS

410
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,019
WHILE I TALK TO HIM.

411
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,520
I CAN DO THAT. YEAH.

412
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,521
OKAY, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.

00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,525
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

20 YEAR OLD MALE.

00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,119
HE'S GOT A SEVERED TOE ON HIS RIGHT FOOT.

438
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,621

00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,627
SEVERED TOE. YOU JUST SAID IT.

00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:52,631

THEY'RE MADE OF WICKER.

445
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,636

446
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,637

WHAT?

454
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,653
THIS ISN'T YOUR TOE.

455
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,656
THIS IS A SMALL, VERY COLD PIECE OF CARROT.

456
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,658
YOU BROUGHT A CARROT?

457
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,160
OH, MY GOD.

458
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,163
THERE'S A TOE IN MY KITCHEN.

459
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,666
OH, I'M SORRY! I'LL GO BACK AND GET IT!

460
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,169
IT'S TOO LATE. ALL WE CAN DO IS SEW UP THE WOUND.

461
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,170
WITHOUT MY TOE?

462
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,671
I NEED MY TOE.

463
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,173
I CAN GO REALLY FAST.

464
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,176
DAD, GIVE ME THE KEYS TO YOUR PORSCHE.

465
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,678
OH, I'M NOT FALLING FOR THAT ONE.

466
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,680
THAT'S WHY I LOST MY TOE?

467
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,182
BECAUSE I CALLED YOU FAT?

468
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,686
I DIDN'T MEAN TO CUT IT OFF. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

469
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,688
THAT'S WHY, FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR

470
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,690
PEOPLE CALLED ME SIR LIMPS A LOT?

471
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,192
I'M SORRY.

472
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,695
IT WASN'T YOUR WHOLE TOE.

473
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,697
YEAH, WELL, I MISS THE TIP.

474
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,699
IT'S THE BEST PART.

475
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,202
IT HAS THE NAIL.

476
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,705
CHANDLER...

477
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:12,711
SIR LIMPS A LOT-- I CAME UP WITH THAT.

478
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,216
YOU'RE A DORK.

479
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,217

480
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,718
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

481
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,220
CHANDLER, I SAID I WAS SORRY.

482
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,221
WELL, SORRY DOESN'T BRING BACK

483
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,223
THE LITTLE PIGGY THAT CRIED ALL THE WAY HOME.

484
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,726
YOU KNOW, IT JUST FIGURES

485
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,728
THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD HAPPEN TODAY.

486
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,231
I HATE THIS STUPID DAY AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT.

487
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,232
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

488
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,733
OH, WAIT, CHANDLER.

489
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,236
COME HERE. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?

490
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,737
ANYTHING?

491
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,241
YEAH, JUST... LEAVE ME ALONE FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

492
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,248
OH, OH, I'M A DUCK.

493
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,749
I GO, "QUACK, QUACK."

494
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,251
I'M HAPPY ALL THE TIME.

495
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,253

496
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,264
NICE TRY.

497
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,765
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

498
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,770
LOOK, MONICA...

499
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,776
THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK.

500
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,777
I BET THIS WILL WORK.

501
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,283

502
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,288
YOU ARE SO GREAT.

503
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,290
I LOVE YOU.

504
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,799
WHAT?

505
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,301
NOTHING. I SAID...

506
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,303
I SAID, "YOU'RE SO GREAT," AND THEN I JUST...

507
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,804
I JUST STOPPED TALKING.

508
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,806
YOU SAID YOU LOVED ME.

509
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,808
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS.

510
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,809
NO, I DIDN'T.

511
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,812
YES, YOU DID.

512
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,314
NO, I DIDN'T.

513
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,816
YOU LOVE ME.

514
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:58,817
NO, I DON'T!

515
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,818
STOP IT! STOP IT!

516
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,819
STOP IT! STOP IT!

517
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,822

518
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,326

519
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,333
GAUZE!

520
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,834

523
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,840

524
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,845
PHEW!

525
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,353
THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS, HUH?

526
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,856
OKAY. ALORS.
