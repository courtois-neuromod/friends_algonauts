1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,504
GOOD. YOU GUYS ARE ALL HERE.

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,506
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,509
WELL, I HAVE A JOB INTERVIEW AT RALPH LAUREN TOMORROW.

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,510
 OH...

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,511
CONGRATULATIONS.

6
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,514
OH, BOY, THAT GUY'S UNDERWEAR SUCKS.

7
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,016
WHAT?

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,018
OH, I GOT THIS PAIR MARKED "XS."

9
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,521
LET ME TELL YOU, THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR "XS" ANYTHING IN THERE.

10
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,023
 ANYWAY

11
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,025
I'M GOING TO BE THE COORDINATOR OF THE WOMEN'S COLLECTION.

12
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,526
I'LL WORK RIGHT UNDER THE DIRECTOR.

13
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,527
I MEAN, IT'S THE PERFECT

14
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,029
PERFECT JOB FOR ME.

15
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,531
WELL, IF YOU NAIL THE INTERVIEW, YOU'LL GET IT.

16
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,034
YOU WANT TO WORK ON YOUR INTERVIEW SKILLS?

17
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,535
OKAY. OKAY.

18
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,037
ALL RIGHT.

19
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,538
LET'S START WITH THE HANDSHAKE.

20
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,040
HI. HI.

21
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,541
VERY GOOD HANDSHAKE.

22
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,043
GOOD WRIST ACTION.

23
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,044
LET ME TRY.

24
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,045
OKAY.

25
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,049
OH, MY GOD! WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU?

26
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,051
DID I SQUEEZE IT TOO HARD?

27
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,554
LET'S JUST SAY I'M GLAD I'M NOT CHANDLER.

41
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,607
THAT'S RIGHT, ROSS-- I CAN SEE YOU IN YOUR NEW APARTMENT

42
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,609
AND YOU CAN SEE ME-- SAME AS YESTERDAY.

43
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,112
SAME AS THE DAY BEFORE.

44
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,114
IS HE DOING HIS "SHARK ATTACK" BIT YET?

45
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,116
NOPE. WAIT.

46
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,117
THERE HE GOES.

47
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,632
VERY FUNNY, ROSS.

48
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:17,137
VERY LIFELIKE AND FUNNY. OKAY.

49
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,140
OH, NO, NO, NO.

50
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,641
I WASN'T WAVING AT YOU, LADY.

51
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,646
WHOA. MAYBE I WAS.

52
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,149
HEY, MONICA, THIS TOTALLY HOT GIRL IN ROSS' BUILDING

53
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,150
IS FLIRTING WITH ME.

54
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,651
GET IN THERE, MAN.

55
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,653
FLIRT BACK. MIX IT UP.

56
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,156
YEAH, I'M DOWN WITH THAT.

57
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:41,161
OKAY, HERE GOES.

58
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,664
HOW... YOU...

59
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,667
A DOING?!

60
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,170
IT WORKED.

61
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,171
SHE'S WAVING ME OVER.

62
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,173
OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

63
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,174
LET'S SEE.

64
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,675
SHE'S ON THE THIRD FLOOR.

65
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,178
WOW, SHE IS PRETTY, HUH?

66
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,679
TELL ME ABOUT IT, HUH?

67
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,681
NO, NO, NO.

68
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,683
NO, NO, I'M NOT WITH HER.

69
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,185
NO, THAT'S JUST MONICA.

70
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,688
BLEAH! UH UH.

71
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,206
HEY, JOEY.

72
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,209
GREAT STUFF, HUH?

73
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,710
THIS YOUR PLACE?

74
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,212
YEAH, OF COURSE, IT IS. OH, COME ON IN.

75
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,213
OOH, WHOO

76
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,214
GO BY THE WINDOW.

77
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,216
YOU CAN PRETEND TO BE SURFING.

78
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,719
BUT I COUNTED.

79
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,221
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO LIVE HERE.

80
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,722
OH, MAN.

81
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,228

82
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,229
WHAT HAPPENED?

83
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,231
I ENDED UP AT ROSS' PLACE.

84
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,733
I MUST HAVE MISCOUNTED OR SOMETHING.

85
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,237
DAMN! SHE'S NOT THERE ANYMORE.

86
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,740
LOOK, ROSS IS DOING HIS "WATCHING TV" BIT.

87
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,746
NO, JOEY, I THINK HE'S JUST WATCHING TV.

88
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,259
 We've lost visual contact with the suspect.

89
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,262
OKAY, NOW I REALLY HAVE TO GO.

90
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,264
IT'S SO UNFAIR THAT OUR DATE

91
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,267
HAS TO GET CUT SHORT JUST BECAUSE SOME GUY

92
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,768
SHOT AT A STORE CLERK.

93
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,271
I KNOW, BUT IT'S MY JOB, SWEETHEART.

94
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,273
OKAY, BUT MAYBE I COULD COME, TOO.

95
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:37,277
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.

96
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,278
ALL RIGHT, YOU GO.

97
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,782
OKAY, BYE.

98
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,788
OH, GOD.

99
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,789
WHAT?

100
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,791
OH, I JUST MISS HIM SO MUCH.

101
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,296
WOW, FOR JUST A WEEK

102
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,798
YOU GUYS ARE REALLY CLOSE, HUH?

103
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,799
YEAH, IT'S WEIRD.

104
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,301
I CAN'T HELP IT, THOUGH.

105
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,802
HE'S SO SWEET.

106
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,805
HE'S LIKE THIS LITTLE PUPPY DOG, YOU KNOW?

107
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,808
BUT LIKE A REALLY TOUGH ONE WHO SHOOTS BAD GUYS.

108
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,310
I JUST LOVE THE BEGINNING PARTS

109
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,811
OF RELATIONSHIPS, YOU KNOW?

110
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,314
YOU JUST CAN'T KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF EACH OTHER.

111
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,816
I KNOW. IT IS THE BEST.

112
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,318
OH, GOD.

113
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,820
SO HOW LONG DID THAT LAST FOR YOU AND CHANDLER?

114
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,824
WHAT? IT'S STILL GOING ON.

115
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,825
COME ON.

116
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,827
SERIOUSLY, WHEN DID IT END?

117
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,828
I AM SERIOUS.

118
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,332
I MEAN, WE'RE ALL OVER EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME.

119
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,333
WELL, YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE

120
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,334
BETTER THAN I DO.

121
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,835
I WAS JUST CURIOUS.

122
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,338
WHY DON'T YOU JUST CALM DOWN, PHOEBE, ALL RIGHT?!

123
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,839
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GET

124
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,840
ALL YOUR FACTS

125
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,343
BEFORE YOU RUN AROUND TELLING EVERYBODY

126
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,844
YOU'RE THE ONLY HOT COUPLE?

127
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,347
GOD, I AWOKE THE BEAST.

128
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,349
I WAS WRONG

129
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,350
OBVIOUSLY.

130
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,351
I JUST, I MISSPOKE.

131
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,352
IT'S OKAY.

132
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,853
WELL, IT IS OKAY.

133
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,355
I MEAN, AS LONG AS YOU KNOW THAT

134
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,357
CHANDLER AND I ARE ALSO VERY HOT AND FIERY.

135
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,858
I MEAN, JUST AS HOT AS YOU.

136
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,360
I MEAN, OUR FLAME...

137
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,361
WHOO!

138
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,862
IS ON FIRE!

139
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,366
HEY, MONICA, HERE'S YOUR BROOM BACK.

140
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,867
MMM.

141
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,869
YOU ARE SO CUTE.

142
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,876
WOW, THAT CUTE PART

143
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,379
KEEPS GETTING LOWER AND LOWER, DOESN'T IT?

144
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,884
OH, HEY.

145
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,386
HOW'D THE INTERVIEW GO?

146
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,887
OH, HORRIBLE.

147
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,390
I DID THE STUPIDEST, MOST EMBARRASSING THING.

148
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,891
DID YOU TELL THE GUY

149
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,393
YOU WANTED TO HAVE SEX WITH HIS WIFE

150
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,394
AND THEN FALL

151
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,895
RIGHT OUT OF YOUR CHAIR?

152
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,397
NO.

153
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,399
DID YOU GET DRUNK ON THE WAY OVER THERE?

154
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,900
NO.

155
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,403
THAT EXPLAINS WHY YOU DIDN'T DO THE OTHER STUFF.

156
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,905
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

157
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,407
OH, IT WAS HORRIBLE.

158
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,909
AND THE INTERVIEW PART WENT SO WELL.

159
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,411
I EVEN MADE HIM LAUGH.

160
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,413
HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT A BOAT

161
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,414
AND I WAS, LIKE, WELL

162
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,418
"YEAH, IF YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH LIFE JACKETS."

163
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,923
OH. TRUST ME. IT IT WAS ACTUALLY...

164
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,425
IT WAS VERY FUNNY. ANYWAY, SO

165
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,926
WE WERE SAYING GOOD BYE

166
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,928
AND, UH, OH...

167
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,430
WHAT HAPPENED?

168
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,432
ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE WERE SHAKING HANDS

169
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,434
AND HE KIND OF LEANED IN TOWARD ME...

170
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,936
YOU KNOW, MAYBE HE WAS GOING TO OPEN THE DOOR

171
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,438
BUT I TOTALLY MISREAD HIM

172
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,439
AND, I, UH...

173
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,449
YOU KISSED HIM?

174
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,451
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

175
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,453
WELL, YOU COULD'VE TRIED...

176
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,455
NOT KISSING HIM.

177
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,457
THANKS, CHANDLER.

178
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,959
HEY, RACH, A GUY FROM RALPH LAUREN CALLED.

179
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,461
YOU GOT A SECOND INTERVIEW.

180
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,962
MONICA, THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

181
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,465
OH, OKAY. UM...

182
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,467
A GUY FROM RALPH LAUREN CALLED!

183
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,470
YOU GOT A SECOND INTERVIEW!

184
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,975
OH, MY GOD, MONICA, YOU BETTER BE SERIOUS.

185
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,978
YOU JUST TOLD ME TO BE FUNNY.

186
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,980
OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

187
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,482
I GOT A SECOND INTERVIEW.

188
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,983
I BET THAT KISS ISN'T LOOKING

189
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,985
LIKE SUCH A MISTAKE NOW, IS IT?

190
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,487
WAIT. YOU DON'T THINK

191
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,988
THAT'S WHY HE WANTS ME BACK?

192
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,989
YEAH.

193
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,493
NO?

194
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,495
KISS? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

195
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,498
OH, WELL, I I ACCIDENTALLY KISSED HIM IN THE INTERVIEW

196
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,999
AND NOW HE WANTS ME BACK.

197
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,501
YOU KNOW, OF COURSE, BECAUSE

198
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,504
"LET'S BRING BACK THE GIRL WHO KISSES EVERYBODY."

199
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,507
COME ON, RACH.

200
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,509
OH, MY GOD, WHAT IF HE THINKS I'M THE KIND OF GIRL

201
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,010
THAT WILL JUST SLEEP WITH HIM?

202
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,011
HE PROBABLY WANTS YOU BACK

203
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,513
BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT FOR THE JOB.

204
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,014
MAYBE. I I... I DON'T KNOW.

205
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,517
OH, GOD! HOW COULD I BE SO STUPID?!

206
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,519
OH, RACHEL, LOOK, DON'T SAY THAT.

207
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,521
I I THINK YOU JUST NEED A HUG FROM JOEY.

208
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,522
COME ON.

209
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,023
COME ON.

210
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,525
SHE'S BACK!

211
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,026
HOT GIRL'S BACK!

212
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,529
AH, WELL, I'M NOT TOTALLY BACK YET

213
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,531
BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR...

214
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,032
NO, IN ROSS' BUILDING, SHE'S BACK!

215
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,534
SHE'S BACK!

216
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,036
OKAY. WAIT THERE. I'LL BE OVER IN A SECOND.

217
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,538
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

218
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,539
GOT IT!

219
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,545
I GOT TO CHECK OUT THIS HOT GIRL.

220
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,549
THERE SHE IS.

221
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,056
DAMN IT!

222
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,058
DID YOU MOVE?!

223
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,560
YES.

224
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,562
I LIVED WITH YOU GUYS FOR A WHILE

225
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,564
AND THEN I FOUND THIS PLACE.

226
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,068
I'M ROSS.

227
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,574

228
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,079
YES?

229
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,082
UH...

230
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,586
DO YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE A HOT GIRL IN THERE?

231
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,087
NOPE.

232
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,590
I'M ALL ALONE.

233
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,592
YEAH. SORRY ABOUT THAT.

234
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,601
OH. HEY, LITTLE GIRL.

235
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,604
UH, IS YOUR MOMMY OR SISTER OR BABY SITTER

236
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,606
BY ANY CHANCE A HOT GIRL?

237
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,107
DADDY!

238
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,609
LATER, GIRL.

239
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,616
OH, MAN.

240
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,120
HOT GIRL?!

241
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,124
HOT GIRL?!

242
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,630
HI, RACHEL. HI.

243
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,631
COME ON IN.

244
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,632
OKAY.

245
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,634
IT'S REALLY NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

246
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,635
THANK YOU.

247
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,136
OH, RACHEL

248
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,638
UH...

249
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,140
WHAT?

250
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,642
JUST, UH...

251
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,643
EXCUSE ME?

252
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,644
YEAH, LET ME...

253
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,145
WAIT! WAIT!

254
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,648
ALL RIGHT. I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

255
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,149
LOOK, I AM SORRY

256
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,151
IF I HAVE GIVEN YOU THE WRONG IMPRESSION

257
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,653
BUT I AM NOT SOME HUSSY

258
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,655
WHO WILL JUST SLEEP AROUND TO GET AHEAD.

259
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,656
WELL...

260
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,157
EVEN THOUGH I KISSED YOU

261
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,659
THAT DOES NOT GIVE YOU

262
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,160
THE RIGHT TO DEMAND SEX FROM ME.

263
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,163
I DO NOT WANT THIS JOB THAT BAD.

264
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,665
GOOD DAY, SIR.

265
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,670
IF YOU'RE GOING IN THERE TO SEE MR. ZELNER

266
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,672
I HOPE YOU'RE READY TO PUT OUT.

267
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,175
I AM.

268
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,182
OH!

269
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,684
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE

270
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,687
WHAT THAT SLEAZEBALL FROM RALPH LAUREN DID TO ME.

271
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,189

272
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,192
OKAY. OKAY, THAT'S AMAZING.

273
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,695
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

274
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,196
YOU GOT INK ON YOUR LIP.

275
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,698
+OH.

276
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,702
OH...

277
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,708
WHAT DO YOU SAY

278
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,209
MAYBE, SOME TIME, I HOLD YOUR GUN?

279
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,210
I DON'T KNOW.

280
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,712
WE'RE REALLY NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.

281
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,213
WHAT COULD HAPPEN?

282
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,715
I MEAN...

283
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,218
YEAH. I'M GOING TO SAY NO.

284
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,221
PHOEBE, DO YOU WANT TO GO SEE A MOVIE

285
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,723
AFTER DINNER TONIGHT?

286
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,224
OH, WE CAN'T. WE ALREADY HAVE PLANS.

287
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,226
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

288
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,729
UM, WELL, SAME THING WE DID ALL DAY.

289
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,230
JUST HANG OUT AT GARY'S APARTMENT.

290
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,232
HE IS SO AMAZING.

291
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,234
WE NEVER LEFT THE BEDROOM.

292
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,738
BUT HAVE FUN AT THE MOVIE.

293
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,742
OH, WELL,WE'RE NOT SEEING A MOVIE.

294
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,243
YOU'RE NOT?

295
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,245
THEN WHY DID YOU ASK US IF WE WANTED TO GO?

296
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,748
OH, UM, THAT'S BECAUSE I JUST, YOU KNOW...

297
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,750
WANTED TO KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS WERE DOING

298
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,751
SO, YOU KNOW

299
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,753
YOU WOULDN'T WALK IN ON ME AND CHANDLER

300
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,255
WHILE WE WERE... YOU KNOW, DOING IT ALL NIGHT.

301
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,258
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME FOR JUST A SECOND?

302
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,260
OKAY.

303
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,763

304
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,765
CHANDLER, CAN I SEE YOU FOR A SECOND?

305
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,767
UH, YEAH. OKAY.

306
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,270
WE HAVE GOT TO BEAT THEM.

307
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,772
WHAT?

308
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,773
BECAUSE... GARY AND PHOEBE

309
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,275
THINK THEY'RE A HOTTER COUPLE THAN WE ARE.

310
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,276
OH. SO?

311
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,778
"SO"?

312
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,780
SO WE'VE GOT TO GO UPSTAIRS

313
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,783
AND HAVE A LOT OF SEX AND PROVE THEM WRONG.

314
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,785
YOU HAVE GOT TO STOP THIS COMPETITIVE THING.

315
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:06,786
OKAY? IT'S CRAZY.

316
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,287
JUST TO IMPRESS GARY AND PHOEBE

317
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,789
YOU WANT ME TO GO UPSTAIRS

318
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,291
AND HAVE SEX WITH YOU OVER AND OVER AND OVER...

319
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,793
AND I'M SAYING NO TO THIS WHY?

320
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,794
GET YOUR COAT!

321
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,303
HI.

322
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,805
HI.

323
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,306
EXCUSE ME.

324
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,311
YOU SHOULD CHECK THIS OUT.

325
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,313
TELL THE OTHER TENANTS.

326
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,815
APPARENTLY, HE'S RUNNING AROUND

327
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,817
LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF HOT GIRL.

328
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,818
HUH!

329
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,821
WHO ISN'T?

330
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,328
I DON'T THINK WE'VE MET.

331
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,329
I'M... I'M ROSS.

332
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,831
I KNOW.

333
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,332
YOU'RE THE GUY WHO WOULDN'T CHIP IN

334
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,834
FOR THE HANDYMAN.

335
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,837
NEVER MIND.

336
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,840
NO, I ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY UNFAIR

337
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,842
THE WAY EVERYONE REACTED.

338
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,844
I MEAN, YOU HAD JUST MOVED IN.

339
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,846
I HAD JUST MOVED IN.

340
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,347
THANK YOU.

341
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,351

343
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,355
JEN, I KNOW THIS MAY SOUND A LITTLE...

344
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,356

345
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,859
BUT, UH... WOULD YOU MAYBE

346
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,362
WANT TO GRAB A CUP OF COFFEE SOMETIME, OR...?

347
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,363
SURE.

348
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,365
THAT WOULD BE NICE.

349
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,867
UM... OH.

350
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,369
MY NUMBER'S ON THERE.

351
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,871
GIVE ME A CALL.

352
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,372
I WILL GIVE YOU A CALL.

353
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,874
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

354
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,875
OKAY.

355
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,381
FORGOT MY PAPER.

356
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,889
THAT WAS AMAZING.

357
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,391
OH, PHOEBE AND GARY ARE SO GOING

358
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,894
TO HEAR ABOUT THIS AT DINNER.

359
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,395
THAT WAS AMAZING.

360
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,899
WE ARE THE HOTTEST.

361
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,402
NO ONE IS HOTTER  THAN WE ARE.

362
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,904
WE'RE THE BEST.

363
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,405
NO, YOU'RE THE BEST.

364
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,407
NO, YOU'RE THE BEST.

365
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,409
NO,YOU'RE THE BEST.

366
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,411
I AM THE BEST.

367
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,415
HEY, GUYS.

368
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,417
WHAT YOU BEEN DOING?

369
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,423
HEY, JOEY, ISN'T THAT THE GIRL

370
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,926
WHO WAVED AT YOU THE OTHER DAY?

371
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,928
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I CAN SEE

372
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,429
THROUGH YOUR SHEET.

373
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,433
YEAH. YEAH, THAT'S HER.

374
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,935
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IT DOESN'T MATTER.

375
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,436
I'M NEVER GOING TO GET TO MEET HER ANYWAY

376
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,939
BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND HER APARTMENT.

377
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,441
SHE LIVES IN, LIKE, SOME HOT GIRL PARALLEL UNIVERSE

378
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,943
OR SOMETHING.

379
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,945
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

380
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,947
SHE OBVIOUSLY LIVES ON THE SECOND FLOOR

381
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,448
SEVENTH APARTMENT FROM THE LEFT.

382
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:50,950
NO, NO, NO.

383
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,451
SHE LIVES ON THE THIRD FLOOR

384
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,953
EIGHTH APARTMENT  FROM THE LEFT.

385
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,455
NO. THOSE FIRST TWO WINDOWS-- THAT'S THE LOBBY.

386
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,458
AND THAT OTHER WINDOW OVER THERE-- THAT'S THE STAIRWAY.

387
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,960
YOU'VE BEEN COUNTING WRONG.

388
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,461
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

389
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,462
THANK YOU, MONICA.

390
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,965
I CAN'T BELIEVE I ALMOST LOST ANOTHER GIRL

391
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,466
BECAUSE OF COUNTING.

392
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,470
SO, ARE YOU READY?

393
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,972
YEAH. I'LL JUST GET MY COAT.

394
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,973
OKAY.

395
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:14,974

396
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,475
COULD YOU GET THAT?

397
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,476
SURE.

398
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,485

399
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,987
NO! NO!

400
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:34,994
PLEASE, SIT.

401
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,495
FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY

402
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,497
THANK YOU FOR AGREEING TO SEE ME AGAIN.

403
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,999
THAT'S, UH, QUITE ALL RIGHT.

404
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,001
BUT I FEEL OBLIGATED TO TELL YOU

405
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,503
THAT THIS MEETING IS BEING VIDEOTAPED.

406
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,009
OKAY, UM...

407
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,511
WELL, FIRST, I WOULD LIKE TO START

408
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:57,016
BY APOLOGIZING FOR KISSING YOU AND, UH, FOR YELLING AT YOU.

409
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,517
FAIR ENOUGH.

410
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,020
NOW, YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HIRE

411
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,521
ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO, UH...

412
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,023
WHO DID NOT, UM...

413
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,525
YELL AT YOU AND STORM OUT.

414
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,526
MM HMM.

415
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,030
AND I THINK THAT'S A BIG MISTAKE, AND HERE'S WHY.

416
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,034
I MADE A HUGE FOOL OF MYSELF, AND I CAME BACK.

417
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,535
THAT SHOWS COURAGE.

418
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,537
WHEN I THOUGHT YOU WANTED SEX

419
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,040
IN EXCHANGE FOR THIS JOB, I SAID NO.

420
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,042
THAT SHOWS INTEGRITY.

421
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,043
AND I WAS NOT AFRAID

422
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,045
TO STAND UP FOR MYSELF

423
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,047
AND THAT SHOWS COURAGE.

424
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:32,051
OKAY, NOW, I KNOW THAT I'VE ALREADY SAID COURAGE

425
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,554
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO HAVE COURAGE.

426
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,057
AND, UM...

427
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,059
AND, FINALLY, WHEN I THOUGHT

428
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,562
YOU WERE MAKING SEXUAL ADVANCES IN THE WORKPLACE

429
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,565
I SAID NO, AND I WAS NOT LITIGIOUS.

430
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,566
SO THERE YOU GO.

431
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,568
YOU GOT... YOU GOT COURAGE

432
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,571
YOU GOT INTEGRITY, YOU GOT COURAGE AGAIN

433
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,073
AND NOT LITIGIOUS.

434
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,577
LOOK, MISTER...

435
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,578
ZELNER.

436
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,081
ZELNER. I KNEW THAT.

437
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,582
OH, I KNEW THAT.

438
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:04,583
UH...

439
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,086
I REALLY, REALLY WANT THIS JOB.

440
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,087
AND I THINK...

441
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,590
I THINK I WOULD BE REALLY GOOD AT IT.

442
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,095
YOU KNOW WHAT?

443
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,096
YEAH?

444
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,598
I MAY REGRET THIS, BUT, UH...

445
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,101
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A SHOT.

446
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,602
OH, YOU ARE?

447
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,603
MM HMM.

448
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,604
REALLY? YEAH.

449
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,106
OH, THANK YOU.

450
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,107
OH, GOD...

451
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,609
OH, WOULD IT BE COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE

452
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,610
IF I GAVE YOU A HUG?

453
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,112
YES. OKAY.

454
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,614
WELL, THEN, HOW ABOUT A HANDSHAKE?

455
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,117
AH, OH, GOD, I'M SORRY.

456
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,119
I, UH...

457
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,120
OH, GOD, I'M SORRY.

458
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,621
I DID NOT MEAN TO TOUCH THAT--

459
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,622
I MEAN YOU.

460
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,125
THERE. THERE, UM...

461
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,127
OKAY, SO, THANK YOU.

462
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,128
I'M GOING TO LEAVE.

463
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,129
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

464
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,130
THANK YOU SO...

465
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,132
HEY, I'LL SEE YOU MONDAY.

466
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,137
ARE YOU TIRED, CHANDLER?

467
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,639
YOU BETTER BELIEVE HE'S TIRED

468
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,141
AFTER THE DAY WE HAD

469
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,642
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

470
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,144
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

471
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,647
HONEY, THE TORTILLA CHIPS KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

472
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,151
SO, CHANDLER, DO YOU LIKE THAT BADGE I GOT YOU?

473
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,653
OH, YEAH, IT'S SO COOL.

474
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,157
NOW I GOT TO GO.

475
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,159
OFFICER BING'S GOT A 10-100.

476
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,662
THAT'S PEE PEE.

477
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,666
PHOEBE, YOU... YOU HAVE A...

478
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,168
A TWIG IN YOUR HAIR.

479
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,172
OH... UM, WE KIND OF TOOK A LITTLE DETOUR

480
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,174
ON OUR WAY OVER HERE.

481
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,676
YEAH, WE WERE TAKING A LITTLE STROLL THROUGH THE PARK

482
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,178
AND NO ONE WAS AROUND, SO...

483
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,679
YOU DIDN'T.

484
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,680
WE DID.

485
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,682
WE VIOLATED SECTION 12

486
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,685
PARAGRAPH SEVEN, OF THE CRIMINAL CODE.

487
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,689
THE PARK, HUH?

488
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,692
PUBLIC PLACE.

489
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,194
MM HMM.

490
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,195
I HEAR YOU.

491
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,197
CAN YOU EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND?

492
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,701
OH...

493
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,208
HI, CHANDLER.

494
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,712
MONICA, THIS IS THE MEN'S ROOM.

495
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,714
ISN'T IT?

496
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,216
YES, IT IS.

497
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,719
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THE MEN'S BATHROOM VERY SEXUAL.

498
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,221
HAVEN'T YOU?

499
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,722
NO.

500
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:27,726
AND, IF I DID, I DON'T THINK WE'D BE GOING OUT.

501
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,729
LOOK, MON, I DON'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT YOU

502
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,231
AND I REALLY DON'T WANT

503
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,733
TO DISAPPOINT THE GUY IN THE SECOND STALL--

504
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,737
SORRY, MAN--

505
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,241
BUT COME ON, THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS.

506
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,743
COME ON. WE CAN'T LET THEM WIN.

507
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,246
WE HAVE ALREADY PROVED THAT WE ARE HOT, OKAY?

508
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,748
SO WHY ARE YOU GETTING SO OBSESSED ABOUT THIS THING?

509
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,750
BECAUSE PHOEBE AND GARY ARE IN THAT...

510
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,252
CAN'T KEEP THEIR- HANDS OFF EACH OTHER

511
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,753
DOING IT IN- THE PARK PHASE.

512
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,755
OH! SO?

513
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,257
SO... IT'S REALLY SAD

514
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,759
THAT WE'RE NOT THERE ANYMORE.

515
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,762
OH, WOW, IS THAT WHAT THIS HAS ALL BEEN ABOUT?

516
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,265
WASN'T IT A LOT MORE EXCITING

517
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,267
WHEN WE WERE, YOU KNOW

518
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,270
ALL OVER EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME?

519
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,272
WELL, YEAH, THAT WAS GREAT.

520
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,773
THAT WAS REALLY... GREAT.

521
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,275
BUT, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH

522
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,277
I'M MORE EXCITED ABOUT WHERE WE ARE NOW.

523
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,778
REALLY?

524
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,779
YEAH.

525
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,281
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A RELATIONSHIP

526
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,283
THAT'S LASTED THIS LONG BEFORE, YOU KNOW?

527
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,284
AND TO GET PAST THE BEGINNING

528
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,786
AND STILL WANT TO BE AROUND EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME--

529
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,788
WELL, I THINK THAT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE.

530
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,292
AND THE FACT THAT THIS IS ALL HAPPENING WITH YOU...

531
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,794
YEAH, I THINK THAT'S PRETTY EXCITING.

532
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,301
THAT'S SO SWEET.

533
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,805
I KNOW THAT I WAS ACTING A LITTLE CRAZY, BUT, UM...

534
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,307
I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

535
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,808
YEAH?

536
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,315
YOU KNOW WHAT I JUST REALIZED?

537
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,817
YOU JUST FREAKED OUT ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP.

538
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,818
I DID NOT.

539
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,819
YES, YOU DID; ADMIT IT.

540
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,321
YOU FREAKED OUT.

541
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,324
OKAY, I FREAKED OUT A LITTLE.

542
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,327
A LITTLE? YOU FREAKED OUT BIG TIME, OKAY?

543
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,328
AND I FIXED IT.

544
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,330
WE HAVE SWITCHED PLACES.

545
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,831
I AM THE RELATIONSHIP KING

546
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,335
AND YOU ARE THE CRAZY, IRRATIONAL SCREWUP.

547
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,836
OOH OOH!

548
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,840
AND NOW WE'RE BACK.

549
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:34,353
I CANNOT BELIEVE ROSS IS BUYING THIS.

550
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,354
THANK GOD.

551
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,855
I CAN'T WATCH HIM ANYMORE.

552
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,357
YOU GUYS READY FOR THE MOVIES?

553
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,358
YEAH.

554
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,360
THANK YOU FOR LOANING US PAMELA AND YASMINE.

555
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,365
MAN, THEY CANNOT GET ENOUGH.
