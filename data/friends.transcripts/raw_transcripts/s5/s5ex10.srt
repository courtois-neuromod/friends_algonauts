1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,505
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,508
I REORGANIZED THE FRIDGE.

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:12,512
SEE? BOTTOM SHELF MEATS AND DAIRY.

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,515
MIDDLE SHELF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:20,520
AND TOP SHELF EXPIRED PRODUCTS.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,022
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,024
BECAUSE I AM BOR ED OUT OF MY MIND.

8
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,026
I'VE ALREADY BEEN TO THE BANK

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,528
THE POST OFFICE AND THE DRY CLEANERS.

10
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,531
DUDE, YOU JUST DESCRIBED SEVEN DAYS' WORTH OF STUFF.

11
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,034
YOU GOT TO SPREAD IT OUT A LITTLE, YOU KNOW?

12
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,036
HAVEN'T YOU EVER BEEN UNEMPLOYED?

13
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,537
HEY, I AM NOT UNEMPLOYED.

14
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,039
I'M ON SABBATICAL.

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,540
HEY, DON'T GET RELIGIOUS ON ME, OKAY?

16
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,543
A GUY IN YOUR POSITION

17
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,545
NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE BETTER AT RELAXING

18
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,546
YOU KNOW?

19
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,547
WHY DO YOU THINK WE HAVE

20
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,049
THE COMFORTABLE CHAIRS, HUH?

21
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,051
COME HERE. SIT DOWN.

22
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,052
READY?

23
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,553
WATCH.

24
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,555
AH!

25
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,057
AND THEN...

26
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,559
OH, YEAH! HUH?

27
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,061
SO WHAT? WE JUST SIT?

28
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,062
OH, NO, NO.

29
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,563
WE'RE NOT GOING TO JUST SIT.

30
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,564
WATCH.

31
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,565

32
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,568

33
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,569
Hello. Chandler Bing.

34
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,572
HELLO, MR. BING.

35
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,074
I LOVE YOU.

36
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:19,079
Whoever this is, stop calling me.

37
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,580
It's been six months.

38
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,581
It's not funny.

39
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:27,587
I CAN SEE YOU, MR. BING.

40
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,089
YOU LOOK SEXY IN YOUR NEW SUIT.

41
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,091
Leave me alone.

42
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,593
For the love of God, leave me alone!

43
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,595
AND THAT'S WEDNESDAY. AHH.

57
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,148
HEY, YOU GUYS, GUESS WHAT.

58
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,650

59
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,152
THE BRITISH ARE COMING?

60
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,655
OH, YOU AND YOUR WAYS.

61
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,659
SINCE IT'S CHRISTMAS TIME, I'M GOING TO BE

62
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,661
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE COLLECTING DONATIONS.

63
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,163
YEAH. I ALREADY HAVE MY BELL

64
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,165
AND LATER ON, I GET MY BUCKET.

65
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,167
YEAH. YEAH.

66
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,669
I'M GOING TO BE OUT THERE SPREADING JOY TO THE PEOPLE.

67
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,671
I MEAN, LAST YEAR, I SPREAD A LITTLE JOY

68
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,173
BUT NOT REALLY ENOUGH

69
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,675
SO THIS YEAR, I'M GOING TO DO THE WHOLE CITY.

70
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,179
YOU KNOW, I KNEW A GIRL IN HIGH SCHOOL

71
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,180
THAT DID THAT.

72
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,681
SHE WAS VERY POPULAR.

73
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,682
THAT'S WEIRD.

74
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,185
YOU'RE STARTING TO SOUND A LOT LIKE CHANDLER LATELY.

75
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,188
THAT IS SO NOT TRUE. THAT IS SO NOT TRUE.

76
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,193
SO, PHEEBS, WHERE ARE YOU DOING ALL YOUR BELL RINGING?

77
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,196
THEY GAVE ME A GREAT SPOT RIGHT BY MACY'S.

78
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,698
YEAH, THEY HARDLY EVER GIVE SUCH A GOOD CORNER TO A ROOKIE

79
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,200
BUT I'M THE ONLY ONE

80
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,202
WHO CAN SAY "MERRY CHRISTMAS" IN 25 LANGUAGES.

81
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,205
I LIED.

82
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,206
OH, MY GOD.

83
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,707
OKAY, YOU GUYS, HERE'S DANNY. WATCH.

84
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,209
JUST WATCH THIS.

85
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,713
SEE?

86
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,716
STILL PRETENDING HE'S NOT INTERESTED.

87
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,219
OKAY, HE'S COMING OVER.

88
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,720
JUST PRETEND LIKE WE DON'T KNOW HIM.

89
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,222
WE'VE FORGOTTEN WHO HE IS.

90
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,223
HEY, GUYS.

91
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:43,723
 HEY, DANNY.

92
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,726
OH, DANNY, HEY.

93
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,728
WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

94
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,230
OH, GOD.

95
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,731
DANNY, YOU KNOW RACHEL.

96
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,732
SHE'S NICE.

97
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,234
SHE'S NOT BAD TO LOOK AT, RIGHT?

98
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,735
THANKS, MON.

99
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,237
WELL, OF COURSE.

100
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,239
DO YOU WANT TO GO  OUT ON A DATE WITH HER?

101
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,240
MONICA!

102
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,742
ABSOLUTELY.

103
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,244
IS FRIDAY OKAY?

104
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,248
FRIDAY IS PERFECT. SHE CAN'T WAIT.

105
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,749
ON THE DATE, I WILL BE ABLE

106
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,251
TO TALK TO HER DIRECTLY, RIGHT?

107
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,755
SEE YOU FRIDAY.

108
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,757
OKAY, WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

109
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,758
YOU KNOW WHAT?

110
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,759
DON'T ANSWER ME.

111
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,761
I HAVE A DATE WITH DANNY. HA!

112
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,764
ALL RIGHT, IT'S 4:30.

113
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,267
I GUESS MY LUNCH BREAK IS OVER.

114
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,269
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO DO?

115
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,271
WELL, I GUESS IF YOU'RE GOING BACK TO WORK

116
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,272
I I'M PROBABLY JUST HANGING OUT.

117
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,773
YOU KNOW, MAKE SOME CALLS.

118
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,774
COOL.

119
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,283
HOW COULD I NOT GET THE PART?

120
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,285
THE PLAY WAS ABOUT A 29 YEAR OLD

121
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,786
ITALIAN ACTOR FROM QUEENS.

122
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:50,290
WELL, TALIA SHIRE SUDDENLY BECAME AVAILABLE.

123
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,292
SHE'S A WOMAN.

124
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,793
WHAT CAN I SAY?

125
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,295
SHE NAILED IT.

126
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:59,799
OKAY. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?

127
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,802
WELL, YOU'RE JUST GOING TO SAY NO AGAIN

128
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,304
BUT GAY PORN?

129
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,808
HAPPY HOLIDAYS!

130
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,810
FELIZ NAVIDAD!

131
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,813
ALLO AND MERRY CHRISTMAS.

00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,814
OH, THANK YOU, SIR.

HERE'S SOME JOY.

134
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,318
PHOEBE! HEY!

00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,320
I JUST WANTED TO SEE HOW IT'S GOING.

136
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,821
WELL, IT'S GOING OKAY.

00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,823
WELL, GOOD. HERE, LET ME HELP YOU OUT.

00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,326
WOW.

140
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,329
IS THAT A  NEW SUEDE JACKET?

141
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,830
IT LOOKS REALLY EXPENSIVE.

142
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,834
YEAH... I GUESS.

143
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,339

00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,343
OKAY. THANKS.

146
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,344
HAPPY HOLIDAYS.

147
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,345
HERE'S YOUR JOY.

148
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,347
THANK YOU.

THANK YOU.

150
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,849
HAPPY HOLIDAYS.

151
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,851
WAIT. YOU CAN'T TAKE THE MONEY OUT.

152
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,852
I'M MAKING CHANGE.

153
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,853
I NEED CHANGE FOR THE BUS.

154
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,355
BUT CAN'T YOU LEAVE THE DOLLAR?

155
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,856
THIS MONEY'S FOR THE POOR.

156
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,359
I'M POOR. I GOT TO TAKE THE BUS.

157
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,362
OKAY. SEASON'S GREETINGS AND EVERYTHING, BUT STILL...

158
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,863
BITE ME, BLONDIE.

159
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,864
OH!

160
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,366
WOW.

161
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,369
OH, I'M GOING TO GIVE HIM SOMETHING BESIDES JOY.

162
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,371
JUST...

163
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,875
THAT PART WAS PERFECT FOR ME.

164
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,877
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T GET IT.

165
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,879
I'M SORRY, MAN.

166
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,382
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?

167
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,885
YOU SHOULD MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN FOR YOURSELF, YOU KNOW?

168
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,387
LIKE, LIKE WRITE A PLAY.

169
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,888
WRITE A MOVIE, HUH?

170
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,391
WHAT ABOUT THOSE GOOD WILL HUNTING GUYS?

171
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,392
COME ON, ROSS

172
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,893
BE REALISTIC, YOU KNOW?

173
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,395
IF I DID WRITE SOMETHING

174
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,399
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES I COULD GET THOSE GUYS TO STAR IN IT?

175
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,902
WAIT A SECOND.

176
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,404
I COULD STAR IN IT.

177
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,405
OR THAT.

178
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,908
I CAN'T WRITE, YOU KNOW.

179
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,410
I'M AN ACTOR.

180
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,413
I COULD ACT LIKE A WRITER. HERE, LOOK...

181
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,418
MMM... OH, OH. YEAH.

182
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,920
BUT SEE? NADA.

183
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,425
I DON'T HAVE THE DISCIPLINE THAT IT TAKES, YOU KNOW?

184
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,426
I CAN'T DO IT.

185
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,427
I'LL HELP YOU.

186
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,929
YEAH. I'LL MAKE UP A SCHEDULE

187
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,432
AND MAKE SURE YOU STICK TO IT.

188
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,434
PLUS IT WILL GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DO.

189
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,435
YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME?

190
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:16,436
YEAH.

191
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,937
THANKS.

192
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,439
ALL RIGHT. WE'LL START OFF SLOW.

193
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,441
THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO DO TONIGHT

194
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,943
IS COME UP WITH THE NAME OF YOUR MAIN CHARACTER.

195
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,944
DONE.

196
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,446
AND IT CAN'T BE JOEY.

197
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,447
IT'S NOT.

198
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:27,947
OR JOSEPH.

199
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,450
OH.

200
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,954
HI.

201
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,456
WHAT'S UP?

202
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,459
I JUST SAW DANNY GETTING ON THE SUBWAY WITH A GIRL

203
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,461
AND HE HAD HIS ARM AROUND HER.

204
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,962
I'M SORRY.

205
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,464
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE.

206
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,965
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

207
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,470
YOU MEDDLED IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.

208
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,971
YOU HAD NO RELATIONSHIP.

209
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,973
NO, BUT I WAS DOING MY THING

210
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,976
AND EVERYTHING WAS GOING ACCORDING TO THE PLAN.

211
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,980
OH, GOD, STOP WITH THE PLAN.

212
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,983
SO WHAT? SO WHAT IF YOU SAW HIM WITH A GIRL.

213
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,985
WHO CARES? IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

214
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,986
LOOK, YOU'RE GOING

215
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,488
TO GO OUT ON A DATE WITH DANNY.

216
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,989
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO CHARMING

217
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,492
HE'S GOING TO FORGET ABOUT THAT STUPID SUBWAY GIRL.

218
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,995
SHE WAS KIND OF STUPID.

219
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:16,996
YOU'RE RIGHT.

220
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,499
ALL RIGHT. I'M JUST GOING TO GO ON THE DATE.

221
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,501
I'M JUST GOING TO GO ON THE DATE.

222
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,003
THAT IS THE NEW PLAN.

223
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,507
HURRY! HURRY!

224
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,524
HEY, HOW DO YOU SPELL SUSPICIOUS?

225
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,025
WHY?

226
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,528
BECAUSE I THINK THIS CHARACTER IS GOING

227
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,530
TO BE SUSPICIOUS ABOUT STUFF.

228
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,532
YES!

229
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,537
CHANDLER BING, SEVEN, CHANDLER BING, ZERO.

230
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,539
YOU'RE DRIVING ME CRAZY WITH THAT.

231
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,540
OKAY. I'LL STOP.

232
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,541
DON'T STOP.

233
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,042
MOVE THE BALL FURTHER AWAY.

234
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,544
ROSS COULD MAKE THAT SHOT.

235
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,554
WELL, YOU SUCK, BUT AT LEAST YOU SUCK AT A MAN'S GAME NOW.

236
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,555
YOU WANT TO PLAY?

237
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,557
CHANDLER, I CAN'T BE PLAYING GAMES.

238
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,058
ROSS IS GOING TO BE HOME SOON

239
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,060
AND I HAVE TO WRITE FIVE WHOLE PAGES

240
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,062
IF I'M GOING TO STICK TO HIS SCHEDULE.

241
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,063
WELL, SO, PLAY FOR THE NEXT 30 MINUTES

242
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,065
AND THEN YOU CAN WRITE UNTIL HE GETS HOME.

243
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,066
ALL RIGHT.

244
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,570
BUT LISTEN, WHAT DO YOU SAY

245
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,573
WE CRANK IT UP A NOTCH?

246
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,074
I'M INTRIGUED.

247
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,577
ALL RIGHT. ALL WE NEED IS A LITTLE LIGHTER FLUID.

248
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,078
OKAY, BUT BE CAREFUL, OKAY?

249
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,580
BECAUSE I WANT TO GET

250
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,081
OUR SECURITY DEPOSIT BACK.

251
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,083
YEAH, I THINK WE SAID GOOD BYE TO THAT

252
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,585
WHEN WE INVENTED HAMMER DARTS.

253
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,086
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

254
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,088
DO YOU REMEMBER WHICH PART IS NOT SPACKLED?

255
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,591
YEAH, RIGHT HERE.

256
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,595
OH, THANK YOU.

257
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,096
HAPPY HOLIDAYS.

258
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,601
NO, THAT'S TRASH, YOUNG LADY.

259
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,102
NO. YOU CAN'T...

260
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,605
HEY, STOP THAT YOUNG LADY!

261
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,106
SHE DONATED TRASH!

262
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,610
HEY!

263
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,612
THE CHARITY'S ON FIRE!

264
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,613
HELP! OH, GOOD.

265
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,114
THANK YOU. I NEED THAT.

266
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,617
WOO! WHAT IS THIS?

267
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,621
IT'S 9:00 IN THE MORNING.

268
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,623
ALL RIGHT.

269
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,624
"A ROOM.

270
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,125
"A MAN ENTERS.

271
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,627
HE LOOKS SUSPICIOUS."

272
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,132
THAT'S IT?

273
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,638
JOEY, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE FIVE PAGES DONE BY NOW

274
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,139
INCLUDING AN EXCITING INCIDENT.

275
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,141
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

276
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:47,146
"THE OFFICIAL RULE BOOK OF FIREBALL."

277
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,649
YEAH, THAT'S THE GAME WE WERE PLAYING.

278
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,651
OH, YEAH, GREAT. SEE, YOU TAKE A TENNIS BALL

279
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,653
A BOWL AND LIGHTER FLUID...

280
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,154
OOPS.

281
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,658
THIS IS HELPING YOUR CAREER?

282
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,660
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO BE AN ACTOR.

283
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,663
NOT THE CREATOR OF "CRAZY LAWSUIT GAME."

284
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,665
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.

285
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,166
I'LL GET BACK TO WORK.

286
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,167
AND SHAME ON YOU.

287
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,669
YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER.

288
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,670
JOEY NEEDS TO WORK.

289
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,671
NOW, COME ON.

290
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,672
HEY.

291
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,674
UH UH. YOU CAN HAVE THIS BACK

292
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,176
WHEN THE FIVE PAGES ARE DONE, HUH?

293
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,178
AH!

294
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,190
I HAD A REALLY NICE TIME TONIGHT.

295
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,191
SO DID I.

296
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,194
I'M REALLY GLAD MONICA ASKED US OUT.

297
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,705
I'D LOVE TO ASK YOU IN, BUT, UH...

298
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,706
MY SISTER'S VISITING

299
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,208
AND I THINK SHE'S ASLEEP ON THE COUCH.

300
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,209
YOUR SISTER?

301
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,712
YOUR SISTER'S ASLEEP ON THE COUCH?

302
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,715
OH, I SAW YOU WITH HER ON THE SUBWAY

303
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,217
AND NOW SHE'S ASLEEP ON THE COUCH.

304
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,218
OH, GOD!

305
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,220
OH, I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU.

306
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,722
HEY, GREAT, YOU'RE UP.

307
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,724
RACHEL, THIS IS MY SISTER, KRISTA.

308
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,725
KRISTA, THIS IS RACHEL.

309
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,726
HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

310
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,728
.
I WISH YOU TOLD ME WE WERE HAVING COMPANY

311
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,729
I'D HAVE FIXED MYSELF UP.

312
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,230
LIKE IT WOULD HELP.

313
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,732
YOU ARE SO BAD.

314
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,733
YOU ARE.

315
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,734
YOU ARE. YOU ARE.

316
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,735
YOU ARE. YOU ARE.

317
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,736
YOU ARE!

318
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,237
YOU ARE SO DEAD.

319
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,238
I'M GOING TO GET YOU.

320
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,740

321
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,241
COME HERE! COME HERE!

322
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,243

323
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,250
UM, VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

324
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,760
NOBODY... NOBODY RESPECTS THE BUCKET.

325
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,763
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT PEOPLE PUT IN HERE.

326
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,766
OKAY. DOES THIS LOOK LIKE A GARBAGE CAN TO YOU?

327
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,767
NO.

328
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,268
DOES IT LOOK LIKE AN ASHTRAY?

329
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,269
NO.

330
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,771
DOES IT LOOK LIKE A URINAL?

331
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,273
EWW!

332
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,775
SO, PHEEBS, YOU GOING TO GO BACK OUT THERE, OR WHAT?

333
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,276
WELL, YEAH.

334
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,779
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY MORE CRAP, OKAY?

335
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,781
NO MORE MRS. NICE BUCKET.

336
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,784
YEAH, GOOD FOR YOU. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TOUGH.

337
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,285
YOU LIVED ON THE STREET.

338
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,287
YEAH, I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO BEING STREET PHOEBE.

339
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,789
YEAH.

340
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,791
OH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I CAN'T GO TOTALLY BACK

341
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,293
BECAUSE STREET PHOEBE REALLY WOULDN'T BE FRIENDS

342
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,294
WITH YOU GUYS.

343
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,800
HI. UM, CAN I ASK YOU GUYS SOMETHING?

344
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,301
 SURE.

345
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,303
UM, I DON'T HAVE ANY BROTHERS, SO I DON'T KNOW

346
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,305
BUT DID YOU GUYS WRESTLE?

347
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,306
OH, YEAH.

348
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,307
ALL THE TIME.

349
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,811
IN FACT, I WAS UNDEFEATED.

350
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,814
WELL, YOU WEIGHED 200 POUNDS.

351
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,818
STILL, I WAS QUICK AS A CAT.

352
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,822
WELL, I MET DANNY'S SISTER YESTERDAY--

353
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,825
UH, THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE GIRL ON THE SUBWAY--

354
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,327
AND, UH, YEAH, THEY WERE VERY, YOU KNOW...

355
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:49,829
WRESTLE Y...

356
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,831
BUT I GUESS THAT'S NORMAL?

357
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,834
WE DON'T... WE DON'T WRESTLE NOW.

358
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,838
NOT SINCE I GOT TOO STRONG FOR YOU.

359
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,340
TOO STRONG FOR ME?

360
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,842
YEAH.

361
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,844
YOU WANT TO GO RIGHT NOW?

362
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,346
BECAUSE I'LL TAKE YOU RIGHT NOW, BUDDY.

363
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,348
YOU WANT TO GO?

364
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,850
OH, FINE.

365
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,853
READY?

366
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,855
WRESTLE.

367
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,861
OKAY, OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT?

368
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,863
UM, ACTUALLY, THAT'S GREAT.

369
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,364
THAT HELPS A LOT. THANKS.

370
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,372
GUYS, COME ON. LET'S GO. THE PUCK DROPS IN 20 MINUTES.

371
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,374
JOEY'S NOT GOING.

372
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,877
I DIDN'T FINISH MY FIVE PAGES.

373
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,379
WELL, WHY CAN'T YOU FINISH THEM TOMORROW?

374
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,382
BECAUSE TOMORROW HE'S REDOING YESTERDAY'S PAGES.

375
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:47,386
AND YESTERDAY'S PAGES DID NOT REFLECT MY BEST WORK.

376
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,388
WHY DON'T YOU CUT HIM A LITTLE SLACK, OKAY?

377
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,891
MAYBE IF HE RELAXES A LITTLE BIT, HE'LL GET SOME WORK DONE.

378
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,392
I THINK HE'S BEEN RELAXING ENOUGH

379
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,896
THANKS TO  YOU AND FIREBALL.

380
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,899
DUDE, IF YOU THINK FIREBALL'S RELAXING

381
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,901
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE NEVER PLAYED.

382
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,903
THE ONLY REASON YOU ARE DOING THIS TO JOEY

383
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,905
IS BECAUSE YOU ARE BORED, OKAY?

384
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,907
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT THAT YOU'RE UNEMPLOYED.

385
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,408
I AM NOT UNEMPLOYED.

386
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,409
I'M ON SABBATICAL.

387
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,412
COME ON, LOOK, GUYS. DON'T FIGHT.

388
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,916
AND THE REASON I'M DOING THIS IS BECAUSE I AM JOEY'S FRIEND

389
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,919
AND IF YOU WERE A GOOD FRIEND, YOU'D BE DOING THE SAME THING.

390
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,421
SO BEING A GOOD FRIEND MEANS ACTING LIKE A TOTAL JERK.

391
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,924
IF IT DOES, THEN YOU'RE AN AMAZING FRIEND OF MINE.

392
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,425
 HEY, GUYS, HEY.

393
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,927
HOW ABOUT WE SETTLE THIS

394
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,929
OVER A FRIENDLY GAME OF FIREBALL? HUH?

395
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,430
I'LL GO UNHOOK THE SMOKE DETECTORS.

396
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,432
HOW ABOUT WE SETTLE THIS RIGHT NOW?

397
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,434

398
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,437
THERE. NOW NO ONE'S GOING TO THE GAME.

399
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,939
I PAID FOR THOSE TICKETS.

400
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,441
NO, YOU DIDN'T. YOU SAID YOU WOULD, BUT YOU NEVER DID.

401
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,442
OH, YEAH.

402
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,944

403
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,452
SO, WE FINALLY GET TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN

404
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,455
AND AIRHEAD HERE FORGETS THE CAMERA.

405
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:00,459
WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME ONE TIME.

406
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,962
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN TO YOU?

407
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,463
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

408
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,965
WE WERE JOGGING IN THE PARK

409
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,466
WE SAW THAT REALLY PRETTY BIRD

410
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,968
AND I WANTED TO TAKE A PICTURE

411
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,469
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE MY CAMERA.

412
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,973
OKAY. FIRST OF ALL , CHASING THE CHURRO GUY IS NOT JOGGING.

413
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,976
OH, THIS IS SO GOOD.

414
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,978
YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY IT.

415
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,986
THAT IS GOOD.

416
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,991
OH. DAMN. I GOT IT ON MY PANTS.

417
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,493
HERE. I'LL GET IT.

418
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,001
WE BETTER TAKE THESE OFF UPSTAIRS

419
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,003
OR THAT STAIN'S GOING TO SET.

420
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,005
I WANT TO WEAR THESE PANTS ON OUR DATE TONIGHT.

421
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,008
OH, GREAT.

422
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,509
OKAY. BYE.

423
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,011
OH, MY GOD...

424
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,013
THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

425
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,514
OKAY, SEE? I TOLD YOU.

426
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,016
YEAH, WOW... SORRY, RACH.

427
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,018
I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE BROTHER AND SISTER.

428
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,519
THEY'RE BROTHER AND SISTER?!

429
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,523
SO I GUESS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CANCEL YOUR DATE, HUH?

430
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,025
AND CALL THEIR MOTHER.

431
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,029

432
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,539
OH! WAIT A MINUTE. OPEN YOUR HAND.

433
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,541
LET ME TAKE A LOOK.

434
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,543
QUARTER, DIME, LINT.

435
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,046
NOT INTERESTED IN THAT.

436
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,048
WHAT'S THIS,  A CANADIAN COIN?

437
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,549
GET OUT OF HERE!

438
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,052
OH, MY GOSH.

439
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,056
WHOA! NO DRINKS NEAR THE BUCKET.

440
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,057
SET IT DOWN OVER THERE

441
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,059
AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION.

442
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,563
AND YOU LEAVE  THE "HURT BUNNY" LOOK OVER THERE, TOO.

443
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,065
OH, HI, BOB.

444
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:50,569
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO GET OUT OF HERE!

445
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,072
UH, PHOEBE, WE'VE BEEN GETTING COMPLAINTS

446
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,575
AND, UH, WE'RE GOING TO MOVE YOU TO A LESS HIGH PROFILE SPOT.

447
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,077
WHAT?

448
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,079
UH, GINGER'S GOING TO TAKE OVER THIS CORNER.

449
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,581
THAT CHICK CAN'T HANDLE MY CORNER.

450
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,085
LOOK, EITHER YOU LEAVE OR WE REMOVE YOU.

451
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,586
FINE.

452
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,594
ALL RIGHT. I'LL GIVE YOU ONE POINTER.

453
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,096
LOOK AT FOR THAT BITCH.

454
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,103

455
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,109
OH. HI, RACH. I THOUGHT WE SAID 7:00.

456
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,611
YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT? UH, LET'S SKIP IT.

457
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,113
WHAT? WHY?

458
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:39,118
UM... YOU AND YOUR SISTER SEEM TO HAVE A VERY SPECIAL BOND.

459
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,621
OH, GREAT. THAT SPECIAL BOND AGAIN.

460
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,624
WHY DO WOMEN HAVE SUCH A PROBLEM WITH THE FACT

461
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,127
THAT I'M CLOSE WITH MY SISTER?

462
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,628
WELL... OKAY, LOOK.

463
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,630
LISTEN... I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GO ING ON HERE, BUT...

464
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,132
DO YOU HAVE BROTHERS?

465
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,633
NO. I HAVE TWO SISTERS.

466
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,636
ONE OF THEM ACTUALLY HAS A VERY MASCULINE ENERGY.

467
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,138
ARE YOU CLOSE WITH THEM?

468
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,640
NO, NO. THEY'RE NOT VERY NICE PEOPLE.

469
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,142
COME HERE.

470
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,144
LISTEN. I REALLY LIKE YOU, OKAY?

471
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,146
I THINK THIS COULD GO SOMEWHERE.

472
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,148
SO WHAT IF I'M CLOSE TO MY FAMILY?

473
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,150
YOU GOING TO LET THAT STAND IN THE WAY OF US?

474
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,152
WELL... I DON'T KNOW.

475
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,655
WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT WAY, YOU KNOW...

476
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,159
DANNY, HURRY UP. THE BATH'S GETTING COLD.

477
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,163
WHAT?

478
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,664
YEAH, OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

479
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,172
OH, HEY. THERE'S SOME KIDS PLAY ING IN THE STREET.

480
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,673
YOU WANT TO GO DOWN THERE

481
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,176
GIVE THEM A PROJECT, RUIN THEIR DAY?

482
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,677
HEY, IF THEY HAVE A BALL

483
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,180
MAYBE YOU COULD STICK RAZOR BLADES IN IT

484
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,183
AND TEACH THEM A NEW GAME-- "GOING TO NEED STITCHES" BALL.

485
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,187
HEY, GUYS. I WAS AT THE LIBRARY ALL MORNING

486
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,689
AND I ALREADY FINISHED MY FIVE PAGES FOR TODAY.

487
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:55,194
GREAT. NOW WE  CAN GO TO THE RANGER GAME LAST NIGHT.

488
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:59,198
NO, DUDE. ROSS TORE UP THE TICKETS.

489
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,704
I GUESS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE SO MANY DISTRACTIONS

490
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,207
IT'S EASIER FOR YOU TO FOCUS, HUH?

491
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,209
YEAH, OR ALSO, WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE SOMEBODY

492
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,711
BREATHING DOWN YOUR NECK ALL THE LIVELONG DAY!

493
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,216
WELL... THAT'S FINE, BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS

494
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,218
I FINISHED IT AND I THINK IT'S REALLY GOOD

495
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,719
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD REALLY HELP ME

496
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,722
IS IF I COULD HEAR IT, SO WOULD YOU GUYS READ IT FOR ME?

497
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,724
ALL RIGHT.

498
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,726
ALL RIGHT.

499
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,228
OKAY.

500
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,231
T-- IT'S A TYPICAL NEW YORK CITY APARTMEN

501
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,234
TWO GUYS ARE HANGING OUT. ROSS?

502
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,738
HEY, MAN.

503
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,741
WHAT IS UP?

504
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,744
ABOUT YESTERDAY, I WAS REALLY WRONG.

505
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,246
I AM SORRY.

506
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,250
NO, IT WAS ME. I'M SORRY. I OVERREACTED.

507
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,252
MAYBE IT WAS BOTH OF US

508
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,755
BUT WE HAD OUR BEST FRIEND'S INTER...

509
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:03,262
BUT WE HAD OUR BEST FRIEND'S INTEREST AT HEART.

510
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,265
COULD I BE MORE SORRY?

511
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,771
I DON'T KNOW.

512
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:17,776
I AM ONE SORRY... POLONTOLOGIST...

513
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,282
ALL RIGHT, JOEY. WE WE GET IT.

514
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,783
I'M SORRY.

515
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,285
I'M SORRY, TOO.

516
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,286
OH, NO. NO, NO. KEEP READING.

517
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,288
THE GOOD PART'S COMING UP. KEEP GOING.

518
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,793
I AM SORRY, CHANDLER.

519
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,296
I AM SORRY, ROSS.

520
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,298
A HANDSOME MAN ENTERS.

521
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,300
HEY... HOW'S IT GOING, GUYS?

522
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,803
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU TWO ARE TALKING ABOUT

523
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:49,308
BUT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU.

524
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:53,812
YOU-- YOU WOULDN'T LET ME GIVE UP ON MYSELF

525
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,815
AND YOU-- WELL, YOU CO CREATED FIREBALL.

526
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,318
THE END.

527
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,822
THIS TOOK YOU ALL DAY?

528
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,824
NO, NO. THIS ONLY TOOK FIVE MINUTES.

529
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,826
I SPENT THE REST OF THE DAY

530
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,329
COMING UP WITH NEW, ULTIMATE FIREBALL.

531
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,331

532
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,338
OKAY, IT'S A TYPICAL

533
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,839
NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT.

534
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,841
TWO GIRLS ARE JUST HANGING OUT.

535
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,344
HI. HOW'RE YOU DOING, KELLY?

536
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,346
I'M DOING JUST FINE.

537
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,848
GOD, TIFFANY, YOU SMELL SO GREAT.

538
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,852
IT'S MY NEW PERFUME.

539
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,354
WHY DON'T YOU COME CLOSER

540
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,357
WHERE YOU CAN REALLY APPRECIATE IT?

541
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,361
OH, YOU KNOW, JOEY , YOU ARE SICK.

542
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,362
THIS IS DISGUSTING.

543
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,863
I'M NOT READING THIS.

544
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:48,367
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. THE HANDSOME MAN WAS ABOUT TO ENTER!
