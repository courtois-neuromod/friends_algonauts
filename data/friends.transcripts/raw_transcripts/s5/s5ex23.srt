1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,004

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,506
PHEEBS, COULD YOU GET THAT, PLEASE?

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:10,510
WHY? JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO LAZY TO GET UP OFF YOUR TUSHY?

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,512
NO. NO, IT'S JUST THAT ALL THE PEOPLE

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,015
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD THAT I WOULD WANT TO TALK TO

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,016
ARE RIGHT HERE.

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,518

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,022
SUCKER.

9
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,023
HELLO.

10
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,524
HEY, JOEY.

11
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,525
Hey, Pheebs.

12
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,527
LISTEN, UH, CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

13
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,529
I FORGOT THE PIN NUMBER TO MY ATM CARD.

14
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,031
CAN YOU GET IT FOR ME?

15
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,532
Sure. Where is it?

16
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,035
UH, I SCRATCHED IT ON THE ATM MACHINE DOWN ON THE CORNER.

17
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,038
OH, SO YOU'RE 5639?

18
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,040
THAT'S IT. THANKS, PHEEBS.

19
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,541
HEY.

20
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,543
OH, DO YOU WANT  TO TALK TO CHANDLER? IS THAT JOEY?

21
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,544
LET ME TALK TO HIM.

22
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,046
No.

23
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,048
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN MY MOVIE

24
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,550
WHICH IS A BIG MISTAKE, BECAUSE IT IS REAL. REAL.

25
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,053
HEY, TRIBBIANI, GET BACK TO WORK.

26
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,054
BREAK TIME'S OVER.

27
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,056
OKAY.

28
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,557
WHO WAS THAT?

29
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,059
UH, MY STUNT DOUBLE. YEAH, AND, YOU KNOW

30
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,561
HE'S GETTING A LITTLE TOO FAMILIAR FOR MY TASTE.

31
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,562
 YOU KNOW WHAT?

32
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,564
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO APOLOGIZE TO HIM ALL WEEK.

33
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,566
IF HE'S NOT GOING TO LET ME DO IT ON THE PHONE

34
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,568
I'M GOING DOWN THERE. I'M GOING TO DO IT IN PERSON.

35
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,569
UH, PHEEBS, I HEARD THAT.

36
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,570
UH, CAN YOU PUT HIM ON?

37
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,571
YEAH.

38
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,074
HEY.

39
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,575
DON'T COME OUT HERE.

40
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,576
NO, NO, NO, NO.

41
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,578
I SUPPORT YOU 100%

42
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,081
AND I WANT TO PROVE THAT TO YOU IN PERSON.

43
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,083
I GOT THAT. I FORGIVE YOU.

44
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,584
DON'T COME OUT HERE.

45
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,586
YOU FORGIVE ME? YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TAKING MY CALLS FOR A WEEK.

46
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,588
WELL, I'M TOTALLY OVER IT, CHANDLER.

47
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,589
FRIENDS FOREVER.

48
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,590
DON'T COME OUT HERE.

49
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,594
WOULD YOU MIND DOING A PICTURE WITH US?

50
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,596
WH WHAT WAS THAT?

51
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,598
UH, ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT.

52
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,100
Yeah. Okay, so...

53
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,601
GOOD TALKING TO YOU

54
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,103
AND DON'T COME OUT HERE. ALL RIGHT.

55
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,606
OKAY.

69
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,155
MONICA?

70
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,657
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

71
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,162
MONICA?

72
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,664
PHOEBE?

73
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,666
OH, PHOEBE

74
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,668
I'M SO SORRY. HAVE YOU BEEN HERE LONG?

75
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,170
IT'S OKAY.

76
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,173
WHAT THE HELL TOOK YOU SO LONG?

77
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,676
OKAY, YOU CANNOT TELL CHANDLER, OKAY?

78
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,178
BUT I RAN INTO RICHARD.

79
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,179
WHICH RICHARD?

80
00:02:59,179 --> 00:02:59,679
THE RICHARD.

81
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,682
RICHARD SIMMONS? OH, MY GOD.

82
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,185
NO. MY EX BOYFRIEND, RICHARD.

83
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,687
YOU KNOW, THE TALL GUY, MUSTACHE?

84
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,190
OH, OKAY. THAT ACTUALLY MAKES MORE SENSE.

85
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,691
SO HOW WAS IT?

86
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,692
IT WAS REALLY NICE.

87
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,194
I MEAN, WE STARTED TALKING

88
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,196
AND I I ENDED UP HAVING LUNCH WITH HIM.

89
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,697
THAT IS SO WEIRD. I HAD A DREAM

90
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,698
YOU HAD LUNCH WITH RICHARD.

91
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,699
REALLY?

92
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,700
BUT AGAIN, RICHARD SIMMONS.

93
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,202
SO, GO ON.

94
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,705
ALL RIGHT, THE STRANGE PART WAS, HE WAS... HE WAS REALLY NICE

95
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,706
UM, AND HE LOOKS GREAT

96
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,708
BUT I DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING AT ALL.

97
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,710
OOH. SO NOW, WHY CAN'T WE TELL CHANDLER?

98
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,212
OH, BECAUSE IT'LL TOTALLY FREAK HIM OUT

99
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,713
AND TOMORROW'S OUR ANNIVERSARY.

100
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,215
I JUST DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO SPOIL THAT.

101
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,718
OH. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS HAVE LASTED A WHOLE YEAR. GOD! I KNOW.

102
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,221
WOW, I OWE RACHEL 20 BUCKS.

103
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,223
WHAT?

104
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,225
ON A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BET.

105
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,228
HEY.

106
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,229

107
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,730
IT'S ALMOST OUR ANNIVERSARY.

108
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,731
I KNOW.

109
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,733
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? ONE YEAR AGO TODAY

110
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,735
I WAS JUST YOUR ANNOYING FRIEND, CHANDLER.

111
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,738
AW... NOW YOU'RE JUST MY ANNOYING FRIEND, CHANDLER.

112
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,240
HUH.

113
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,241
I GOT YOU A PRESENT.

114
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,243
OH, BUT IT'S NOT TILL TOMORROW.

115
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,245
I KNOW, BUT YOU HAVE TO OPEN IT TODAY.

116
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,246
OKAY.

117
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,747

118
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,753

119
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,260
OKAY! THERE YOU GO!

120
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,762
IT'S TWO TICKETS TO VEGAS!

121
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,763
WOW!

122
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,764
YEAH, FOR THIS WEEKEND!

123
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,266
OH, GOSH, IT'LL BE PERFECT.

124
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,767
YOU GET TO SEE JOEY.

125
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,270
PLUS, WE GET TO START OUR ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION

126
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,271
ON THE PLANE.

127
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,274
WE CAN CALL IT OUR "PLANEIVERSARY."

128
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,276
DO WE HAVE TO?

129
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,278
NO.

130
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,279
OKAY, BUT THIS IS GREAT

131
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,781
BUT JOEY SAID HE DIDN'T WANT ANY OF US OUT THERE.

132
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,284
OH, HE JUST DOESN'T WANT US TO GO THROUGH ANY TROUBLE.

133
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,785
THINK HOW EXCITED HE'S GOING TO BE

134
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,287
WHEN WE GO OUT AND SURPRISE HIM.

135
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,790
PLUS, WE GET TO HAVE OUR OWN "ANNI VEGAS RY."

136
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,295
"ANNEVADA VERSARY"!

137
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,798
YEAH, I THINK WE SHOULD SEE OTHER PEOPLE.

138
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,300
BUT WE CAN GO, RIG YES.

139
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,801
OKAY. IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

140
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,303
OKAY, I'M GOING TO GO, TOO.

141
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,308
YOU KNOW WHAT, PHEEBS, IT'S KIND OF OUR ANNIVERSARY.

142
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,310
OH, PLEASE. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DITCH ME AGAIN

143
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,811
LIKE YOU DID WITH LONDON.

144
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,313
DITCH YOU? PHOEBE, YOU WERE PREGNANT WITH TRIPLETS.

145
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,315
UH HUH, GREAT STORY. I'M GOING.

146
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,818
HI.

147
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,320
HEY. HEY!

148
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,321
HEY, YOU GUYS, LISTEN.

00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,824
THIS WEEKEND WE'RE ALL GOING TO GO TO LAS VEGAS

150
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,326
TO SURPRISE JOEY--

151
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,827
INCLUDING ME!

152
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,829
DO YOU WANT TO GO?

153
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,831
WELL, I GUESS I COULD TAKE A COUPLE DAYS OFF WORK.

154
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,834
OF COURSE YOU COULD TAKE A COUPLE DAYS OFF WORK

155
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,336
BECAUSE THIS TRIP INCLUDES ME!

156
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,837
OH, NO. WAIT A MINUTE.

157
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,839
WAIT, I'VE GOT A PRESENTATION TOMORROW.

158
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,341
I CAN'T MISS THAT.

159
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,343
OH, I'VE GOT TICKETS TO THE VAN GOGH EXHIBIT.

160
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,345
I'VE BEEN WAITING, LIKE, A YEAR FOR THIS.

161
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,347
ART LOVER.

162
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,353
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

163
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,355
I SAID, "ART LOVER."

164
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,358
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE AN INSULT?

165
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,860
I DON'T KNOW. I'M VERY TIRED.

166
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,363
SO, RACH, MAYBE YOU AND I CAN FLY OUT TOGETHER SATURDAY.

167
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,864
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

168
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,866
HUH? ALL RIGHT, I'LL CALL THE AIRLINES. OKAY. YEAH.

169
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,368
YEAH, YOU KNOW, THAT'LL BE NICE, ACTUALLY

170
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,370
TO HAVE THE APARTMENT TO MYSELF FOR A NIGHT.

171
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,372
OH, YEAH, SO YOU CAN WALK AROUND NAKED.

172
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,873

173
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,875
NO. SO I CAN BE BY MYSELF.

174
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,378
YOU KNOW, HAVE A LITTLE ALONE TIME.

175
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,380
UH HUH, NAKED ALONE TIME.

176
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,882
NO, PHOEBE. JUST BECAUSE I'M ALONE DOESN'T MEAN

177
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,384
I WANT TO WALK AROUND NAKED.

178
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,885
I MEAN, YOU LIVE ALONE.

179
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,387
YOU DON'T WALK AROUND NAKED.

180
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,388
UH HUH. WHY DO YOU THINK

181
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,390
IT TAKES ME SO LONG TO ANSWER THE DOOR?

182
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,401
SO, SO FAR, IS THIS TRIP TO LAS VEGAS BETTER OR WORSE

183
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,902
THAN THE TRIP TO LONDON?

184
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,906
SO FAR, IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME, PHEEBS.

185
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,410
OKAY. WHAT ABOUT AFTER I GIVE YOU THESE CANDIES?

186
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,912
YEAH, I GUESS IT'S A LITTLE BETTER NOW.

187
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,913
HA HA.

188
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,917
OKAY, LAS VEGAS-- ONE; LONDON-- ZERO.

189
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,919
ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

190
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,920
OOH.

191
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,425
HAPPY "PLANEIVERSARY."

192
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,927
AW... I LOVE YOU.

193
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,929
CAN I GIVE YOU YOUR PRESENT NOW?

194
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,431
OKAY. OKAY.

195
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,438
OH, MAN. DON'T TELL ME I DID THIS.

196

I LOVE THE "I FORGOT THE PRESENT" FAKE OUT!

197
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,444
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE "I REALLY DID FORGET THE PRESENT.

198
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,945
PLEASE FORGIVE ME" NOT FAKE OUT?

199
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,947
OH, HONEY, THAT'S OKAY. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

200
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,449
YOU CAN GIVE IT TO ME WHEN WE GET BACK.

201
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,450
NO, THIS IS THE WORST THING

202
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,951
THAT CAN HAPPEN ON AN ANNIVERSARY EVER.

203
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,952
OH, GOOD, ALL RIGHT.

204
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,456

209
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,975
OKAY. I, UM... I RAN INTO RICHARD YESTERDAY

210
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,480
AND HE ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO GO FOR A BITE AND I DID.

211
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,482
AND THE ONLY REASON WHY I DIDN'T TELL YOU

212
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,484
IS BECAUSE I I KNEW YOU'D GET MAD

213
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,486
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO SPOIL OUR ANNIVERSARY.

214
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,488
I'M NOT MAD.

215
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,990

OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

380
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,932
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE ACTING LIKE THIS ALL NIGHT?

381
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,433
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO BE AROUND YOU.

382
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:34,934
FINE WITH ME.

383
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,935

COME ON, COME ON, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY

386
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:39,939
JUST A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING.

387
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:40,940
NO, IT IS NOT.

388
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,441
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

389
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,943
HEY, HEY! DON'T LOOK AT ME.

390
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,944

NOW, I'M I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW

395
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,960
THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION

396
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,462
TO THE PHYSICAL ACT OF LOVE.

397
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,966
YEP, THAT'S HILARIOUS.

398
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,468
I'M SORRY, I'M DONE. I'M DONE.

399
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,970
YOU KNOW, LAST NIGHT

400
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,472
WAS EMBARRASSING FOR YOU, TOO.

401
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,473
NO, NOT REALLY.

402
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,476
I MEAN, YOU'VE SEEN ME NAKED HUNDREDS OF TIMES.

403
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,477
UH HUH, BUT IT WAS A FIRST

404
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,979

OKAY. ALL RIGHT, OKAY. 406 00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,982 THAT'S TRUE, BUT, YOU KNOW

407
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,484
I I JUST DON'T EMBARRASS THAT EASILY.

408
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,486
WHAT? YOU TOTALLY GET EMBARRASSED.

409
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:28,988
NO, I DON'T.

410
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,490
ROSS, I THINK I'M JUST A MORE SECURE PERSON

411
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,491
THAN YOU ARE.

412
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,492
IS THAT SO?

413
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,493
YEAH.

414
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,496
HEY, LADY!

415
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,999
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH YOU WANT IT, OKAY?!

416
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,001
I AM NOT GOING TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU

417
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,002
IN THE BATHROOM!

418
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,009
HEY, YOU KNOW, IN ROMAN TIMES.

419
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,510
THIS WAS MORE THAN JUST A HAT.

420
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,512
REALLY?

421
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,014
YEAH, SURE, SURE.

422
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,016
THEY WOULD, UH, THEY WOULD SCRUB THE FLOORS WITH IT.

423
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,518
THEY WOULD, UH, USE IT TO GET THE MUD OFF THEIR SHOE

424
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,519
AND, UH, SOMETIMES

425
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,021
UNDERNEATH THE HORSE WOULD GET DIRTY

426
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,023
SO THEY WOULD STICK IT RIGHT IN THERE...

427
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,024
JOEY!

428
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,026
I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS IS HOW

429
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,028
I'M SPENDING MY ANNIVERSARY.

430
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,030
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'LL TAKE YOU SOMEPLACE NICE THEN.

431
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,531

00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,033
WHOA! YEAH, YEAH.

433
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,534
HE WAS PLAYING BLACKJACK

434
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,536
FOR, LIKE, AN HOUR , AND HE WON 5,000 DOLLARS.

435
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,538
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? 5,000 DOLLARS.

436
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,540
YOU KNOW, IF I WON 5,000 DOLLARS, I'D JOIN A GYM.

437
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,542
YOU KNOW, BUILD UP MY UPPER BODY

438
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,045
AND HIT RICHARD FROM BEHIND WITH A STICK.

439
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,547
WAIT A MINUTE.

440
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,049
WHY DON'T I JUST DO WHAT THAT GUY DID?

441
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,551
I'LL TAKE THIS HUNDRED DOLLARS, TURN IT INTO 5,000 DOLLARS

442
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,553
AND THEN I'LL TURN THAT INTO ENOUGH MONEY

443
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,055
TO GET MY MOVIE GOING AGAIN.

444
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,556
GOOD LUCK.

445
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,058
CHANDLER, I DON'T NEED LUCK.

446
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,060

THIS IS, LIKE, THE WORST NIGHT EVER.

454
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,077

455
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,079

00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,092
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO SEE RICHARD AGAIN.

461
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,593
SO GO FIX IT.

462
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,095

507
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,723
CHANDLER, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS.

508
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,726
I HAVE FOUND MY IDENTICAL HAND TWIN.

509
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,731
WHAT?

510
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,734
MY IDENTICAL HAND TWIN.

511
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,737
WHAT'S AN IDENTICAL HAND TWIN?

512
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,739
WHAT DOES IT SOUND LIKE?

513
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,741
IT'S A GUY WITH MY IDENTICAL HANDS.

514
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,243
IT WAS INCREDIBLE.

515
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,746
CHANDLER, THE DEALER'S HANDS WERE EXACTLY LIKE MINE.

516
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,749
IT WAS LIKE LOOKING AT MY HANDS IN A MIRROR.

517
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,751
ARE YOU SURE YOU WEREN'T

518
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,254
LOOKING AT YOUR HANDS IN A MIRROR?

519
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,256
DON'T YOU SEE WHAT THIS MEANS?

520
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,758
I CAN FORGET ABOUT THAT STUPID MOVIE.

521
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,760
I'M GOING TO BE A MILLIONAIRE.

522
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,264
HOW?

523
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,766
WELL, LOOK, I DON'T HAVE IT ALL WORKED OUT YET

524
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,768
BUT IT'S GOT TO MEAN BIG MONEY.

525
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,270
COME ON, IDENTICAL HANDS!

526
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,773

527
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,775
HOW?

528
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,278
THIS IS VEGAS, MAN.

529
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,780
PEOPLE WILL PAY TO SEE FREAKY STUFF.

530
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,782
OKAY...

531
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:27,286
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY TO SEE THIS HAND TWICE?

532
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,787
HUH?

533
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,793
YOU KNOW, I I CAN'T REALLY PUT A PRICE ON THAT, JOE.

534
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,296
HEY, ARE YOU UNSUPPORTING ME AGAIN?

535
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,298
NO, NO.

536
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,799
I SUPPORT YOU 100% PERCENT.

537
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,302
I JUST DIDN'T... I DID N'T GET IT RIGHT AWAY.

538
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,304
YOU KNOW, NOW I'M CAUGHT UP.

539
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,805
IDENTICAL HAND TWINS.

540
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,307
IT'S A MILLION DOLLAR IDEA.

541
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,308
RIGHT?!

542
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,310
I KNOW, OKAY, ALL RIGHT!

543
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,312
WHAT'S THAT FOR?

544
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,813
OH, WELL, I GOT TO DOCUMENT THIS

545
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,815
BEFORE THAT DEALER GETS OFF HIS BREAK. I SEE.

546
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,817

547
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,820
HEY.

00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,825
OH, YOU'RE SO LUCKY.

551
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,330
HEY.

552
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,332
SO, WHERE'S MONICA?
