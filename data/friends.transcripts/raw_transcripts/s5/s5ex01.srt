THE JOYOUS UNION OF ROSS AND EMILY.

3
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:10,694

4
00:00:10,694 --> 00:00:12,145

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,079
EMILY.

12
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:31,564
SHALL I GO ON?

13
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:33,166
HE SAID "RACHEL," RIGHT?

14
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,969
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD GO UP THERE?

15
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,772
YES, YES, DO GO ON.

16
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,373
I THINK WE'D BETTER START AGAIN.

17
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:41,574
ROSS

18
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:43,176
REPEAT AFTER ME.

19
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:44,778
I, ROSS...

20
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,780

00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,782
...TAKE THEE,EMILY...

22
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:54,387
...TAKE THEE,EMILY...

23
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,792
IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'D BE ANYBODY ELSE.

24
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:04,397
...AS MY LAWFULLY WEDDED WIFE, IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH

25
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,999
TILL DEATH PARTS US.

26
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,401
...AS MY LAWFULLY WEDDED WIFE

27
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,403
IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH

28
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,405
UNTIL DEATH PARTS US.

29
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,206
REALLY, I DO...

30
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,808

31
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,009
...EMILY.

32
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,411
DO WE HAVE THE RINGS?

33
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,413
EMILY

34
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,816
PLACE THIS RING ON ROSS'S FINGER

35
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:26,019
AS A SYMBOL OF YOUR BOND EVERLASTING.

36
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,224
AH!

37
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:34,027
ROSS, PLACE THIS RING

38
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,029
ON EMILY'S HAND AS A SYMBOL

39
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,832
OF THE LOVE THAT ENCIRCLES YOU FOREVER.

40
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,834
HAPPY TO.

41
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,238
ROSS AND EMILY HAVE MADE THEIR DECLARATION

42
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,840
AND IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE

43
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,441
TO DECLARE THEM HUSBAND AND WIFE.

44
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,646
YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE.

45
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:02,055
THIS IS WORSE THAN WHEN HE MARRIED THE LESBIAN.

46
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,061
JUST KEEP SMILING.

47
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,662
OKAY.

48
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,884
WELL, THAT WENT WELL. YEAH.

49
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,886
COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.

50
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,289
HE COULD HAVE SHOT HER.

51
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:20,890

52
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,693
THAT, UH, THAT WAS PRETTY FUNNY, WASN'T IT?

53
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:25,295

54
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:30,900

55
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,105
?  ?

56
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:38,508
?  ?

57
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:41,311

58
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:46,115

59
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:47,717

60
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:51,721

61
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:55,325
?  ?

62
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:56,926
?  ?

63
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,528
?  ?

64
00:02:58,528 --> 00:03:02,532
?  ?

65
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:05,335
?  ?

66
00:03:05,335 --> 00:03:08,538
?  ?

67
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:15,979
 YOU SPOILED EVERYTHING!

68
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:17,180
IT'S LIKE A NIGHTMARE!

69
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,182
MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY ARE OUT THERE!

70
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:20,383
HOW CAN I FACE THEM?!

71
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:21,985
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?!

72
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:24,387
HEY, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS WITH ROSS AND EMILY

73
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:25,989
WE STILL GET CAKE, RIGHT?

74
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:29,592
TH THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

75
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:31,995
NO, NO, NO, YOU TAKE YOUR TIME, SWEETIE.

76
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:33,196
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT HERE.

77
00:03:33,596 --> 00:03:34,397

78
00:03:34,397 --> 00:03:36,399
SHE'S JUST FIXING HER MAKEUP.

79
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:38,801
 I HATE YOU!

80
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,803
AND I LOVE YOU!

81
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:46,009
BOY, BAD TIME TO SAY THE WRONG NAME, HUH, ROSS?

82
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:49,612
THAT'S TRUE.

83
00:03:49,612 --> 00:03:50,813
THANKS, DAD.

84
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:54,817
HEY, PEOPLE SHOULD BE DANCING, HUH?

85
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,019
THIS IS A PARTY!

86
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:57,220
COME ON!

87
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,421
JOEY

88
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:00,023
DANCE!

89
00:04:00,023 --> 00:04:02,025
? ?

90
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:11,634

91
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:13,636
YES, WALTHAM INTERIORS.

92
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:16,039
OH, HELLO, THIS IS ROSS GELLER'S

93
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:18,441
PERSONAL PHYSICIAN, DR. FILANGIE.

94
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:19,642
WHO?

95
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:21,244
Yeah.

96
00:04:21,244 --> 00:04:25,648
I'VE DISCOVERED THAT ROSS FORGOT TO TAKE HIS BRAIN MEDICINE.

97
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:28,851
UM, NOW, WITHOUT IT, UH, IN THE BRAIN OF ROSS

98
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:32,055
UH, WOMEN'S NAMES ARE INTERCHANGEABLE...

99
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:34,057
THROUGH NO FAULT OF HIS OWN.

100
00:04:34,057 --> 00:04:36,059
OH, MY GOD. PHOEBE.

101
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:38,461
NO, NOT PHOEBE.

102
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:40,063
DR. FILANGIE.

103
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,865
OH, NO, YOU HAVE IT, TOO!

104
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:47,920
WHAT KIND OF BITCH HANGS UP ON A DOCTOR?

105
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:53,209
HEY.

106
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,811
HEY.

107
00:04:54,811 --> 00:05:00,016
OH, WOW, I HOPE YOU DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY, BUT...

108
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:02,819
I KNOW WE HAD PLANS TO MEET UP TONIGHT, AND...

109
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:04,420
AH, I'M JUST, I'M KIND OF WORRIED

110
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,823
ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT DO TO OUR FRIENDSHIP.

111
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:08,024
I KNOW.

112
00:05:08,024 --> 00:05:10,827
OH, HOW COULD WE HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?

113
00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:12,829
SEVEN TIMES!

114
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:18,434
WELL, YOU KNOW, LOOK, WE WERE AWAY.

115
00:05:18,434 --> 00:05:21,637
IN A FOREIGN, ROMANTIC COUNTRY.

116
00:05:21,637 --> 00:05:23,239
I BLAME LONDON.

117
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,241
BAD LONDON!

118
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:27,643
SO, LOOK, UM

119
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:29,645
WHILE WE'RE STILL IN LONDON

120
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:32,048
I MEAN, WE CAN KEEP DOING IT, RIGHT?

121
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:33,649
WELL, I DON'T SEE THAT WE HAVE A CHOICE.

122
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:38,054
BUT WHEN WE'RE BACK HOME, WE DON'T DO IT.

123
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:39,655
ONLY HERE.

124
00:05:40,857 --> 00:05:42,458
YOU KNOW, I SAW A WINE CELLAR DOWNSTAIRS.

125
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,659
MEET YOU THERE

126
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,661
IN TWO MINUTES. OKAY.

127
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:50,867
MON, HONEY, I GOT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

128
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:52,068
NOW?!

129
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:53,269
ROSS SAID MY NAME UP THERE.

130
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,271
I MEAN, COME ON, I CAN'T JUST PRETEND

131
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,472
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN, CAN I?

132
00:05:56,472 --> 00:05:58,474
OH, I I DON'T KNOW.

133
00:05:58,474 --> 00:06:00,076
MONICA, WHAT SHOULD I DO?

134
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:01,277
JUST, UH...

135
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,679
DO THE RIGHT THING.

136
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:05,681
WHAT?

137
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:06,482
TOE THE LINE.

138
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:07,683
THREAD THE NEEDLE.

139
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:08,885
THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.

140
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:09,685
MONICA, WAIT. LISTEN,

141
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:10,887
I THINK I'M JUST GOING TO TALK

142
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:12,889
TO ROSS ABOUT WHAT HE THINKS IT MEANT.

143
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:14,891
WAIT. RACHEL, NO.

144
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:16,492
HE'S MARRIED.

145
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:18,494
MARRIED.

146
00:06:18,494 --> 00:06:20,897
IF YOU DON'T REALIZE THAT, I CAN'T HELP YOU.

147
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:23,699
OKAY. YOU'RE RIGHT.

148
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:24,901
YOU'RE RIGHT.

149
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:26,102
YOU CAN'T HELP ME.

150
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,705
JACK, IS IT ALL OUR FAULT?

151
00:06:29,705 --> 00:06:31,707
WERE WE BAD PARENTS?

152
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:32,508
YES.

153
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:33,709
WHAT?!

154
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:35,311
OH, YEAH? WELL, WHO SERVES STEAK

155
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,512
WHEN THERE'S NO PLACE TO SIT?

156
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:38,915
I MEAN, HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO EAT THIS?

157
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:40,917
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

158
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,320
YOU AND ME, NEXT DANCE?

159
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,773
SORRY, DEAR, I ONLY DANCE WHEN I'M DRUNK.

160
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,775
WANT ME TO GET YOU SOMETHING?

161
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,261
WHERE WERE YOU?

162
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:54,263
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET IN THE WINE CELLAR.

163
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:55,765
FORGET IT. THAT'S OFF. WHY?

164
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:59,051
THE NEXT TOUR OF THE WINE CELLAR

165
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:03,456
WILL COMMENCE IN TWO MI I INUTES.

166
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,458
JOEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

167
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,059
YOU PROMISED PHOEBE

168
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,462
YOU WOULDN'T EAT MEAT UNTIL SHE HAS THE BABIES.

169
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,464
WELL, I FIGURED WE'RE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY

170
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,265
SO IT DOESN'T COUNT.

171
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,866
THAT'S TRUE.

172
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,067
THE MAN'S GOT A POINT.

173
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,671
OH, HI.

174
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,273
HI. HI.

175
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,675
I'M SORRY THINGS AREN'T WORKING OUT SO WELL.

176
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,876
OH, NO!

177
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:24,677

178
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:25,878
COULD BE BETTER.

179
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,079
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY, RIGHT?

180
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,281
OH, YEAH, OF COURSE.

181
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,683
I MEAN, SHE'S GOING TO GET OVER THIS, YOU KNOW?

182
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,285
I MEAN, SO YOU SAID MY NAME.

183
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,087
YOU KNOW, YOU JUST SAID IT BECAUSE YOU SAW ME THERE.

184
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,089
AND IF YOU'D SEEN A CIRCUS FREAK

185
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,892
YOU WOULD'VE SAID, "I TAKE THEE, CIRCUS FREAK."

186
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,496
YOU KNOW, IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

187
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,697
IT'S JUST A MISTAKE.

188
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,299
DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

189
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,500
RIGHT?

190
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,703
NO, NO, OF COURSE IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

191
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:51,504
I MEAN, WHA...

192
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,506
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY EMILY

193
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,508
WOULD THINK IT MEANT SOMETHING

194
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:59,512
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IT WAS YOU, BUT IT ABSOLUTELY DIDN'T.

195
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,113
IT DIDN'T! IT DIDN'T!

196
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,516
ROSS! HEY, THE BAND'S READY OUTSIDE

197
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,918
FOR YOUR FIRST DANCE WITH EMILY, SO...

198
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,920
OH! OH! THE BAND'S READY!

199
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,723
WELL, WE'VE GOT TO DO WHAT THE BAND SAYS, RIGHT?

200
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,725
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE STUPID BAND!

201
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,329
YOU SPIT ON ME, MAN.

202
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,530
I I'M SORRY.

203
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,333
EMILY IS TAKING KIND OF A LONG TIME, HUH?

204
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,737
YOU KNOW, WHEN I LOCKED MYSELF IN THE BATHROOM AT MY WEDDING

205
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:25,938
IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS TRYING

206
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,540
TO POP THE WINDOW OUT OF THE FRAME

207
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,542
ALL RIGHT. AND GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE.

208
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,544

209
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,745

210
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,347

211
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,149
EMILY?

212
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,351
EMILY?!

213
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,753
I'M COMING IN!

214
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,757
WELL, LOOK AT THAT.

215
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:45,958
SAME THING.

216
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,964
LISTEN, IN THE MIDDLE OF EVERYTHING

217
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,966
IF I SCREAM THE WORD "YIPPEE," JUST IGNORE ME.

218
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,171

219
00:08:59,171 --> 00:08:59,972
OH, MY GOD, RACHEL! HI.

220
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,173
OH, HELLO, RACHEL.

221
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,576
ROSS SAID MY NAME.

222
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,978
OKAY? MY NAME.

223
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,980
ROSS SAID MY NAME UP THERE.

224
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,383
THAT OBVIOUSLY MEANS THAT HE STILL LOVES ME.

225
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,984
OKAY, DON'T BELIEVE ME.

226
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,185
I KNOW I'M RIGHT.

227
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,588
YOU GUYS WANT TO GO DOWNSTAIRS AND GET A DRINK?

228
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:18,791
YES, WE DO...

229
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,193
BUT WE HAVE TO CHANGE FIRST.

230
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,195
YES, I WANT TO CHANGE.

231
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,399
WH WHY DON'T YOU GO DOWN AND GET US A TABLE?

232
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,401
YEAH, WE'LL BE DOWN IN, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES.

233
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,201
15 MINUTES.

234
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,803
OKAY.

235
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,205

236
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,006
HELLO.

237
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,207
OH, PHEEBS!

238
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,409
IT'S PHOEBE.

239
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,010

240
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,211
HI!

241
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,813
SO, WHAT HAPPENED?

242
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,815
WELL, ROSS SAID MY NAME.

243
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:46,018
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT MEANS ANYTHING.

244
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,219
OKAY, PHEEBS, YOU KNOW WHAT?

245
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,821
LET'S LOOK AT THIS OBJECTIVELY.

246
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,423
ALL RIGHT, NINTH GRADE, RIGHT?

247
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,624
THE OBSESSION STARTS.

248
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,626
ALL RIGHT?

249
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,827
SUMMER AFTER NINTH GRADE

250
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,829
HE SEES ME IN A TWO PIECE FOR THE FIRST TIME.

251
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,231
HIS OBSESSION BEGINS TO GROW, RIGHT? SO, THEN...

252
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,634
HEY, LISTEN, WHY DON'T WE GO CHANGE IN MY ROOM?

253
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,036
MY CLOTHES ARE... OH!

254
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,638

255
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,853
WOW, YOU LOOK...

256
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:21,654
NO TIME FOR THAT.

257
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,656
OKAY.

258
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,060
HEY, DUDE, LET ME IN.

259
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,062
I GOT A GIRL OUT HERE.

260
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,865
WELL, I'VE GOT A GIRL IN HERE.

261
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,066
NO, YOU DON'T.

262
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,068
I JUST SAW YOU GO IN THERE WITH MONICA.

263
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,273
WELL, WE'RE HANGING OUT IN HERE.

264
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:46,479
WHICH ONE OF US IS GOING TO BE HAVING SEX IN THERE, ME OR YOU?

265
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,682
WELL, I SUPPOSE I WOULD HAVE TO SAY YOU.

266
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:53,285
LOOK, WHAT IF WE'RE WATCHING A MOVIE IN HERE?

267
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,086
WH WHICH WE ARE.

268
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,688
A AND WE ALREADY PAID FOR IT.

269
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,491
IT'S MY GIANT.

270
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,692
MY GIANT?

271
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,094
I LOVE THAT MOVIE!

272
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:08,517
YOU REALLY THINK THIS IS OKAY?

273
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:12,121
WELL, ROSS AND EMILY AREN'T GOING TO USE IT.

274
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:13,723
OH, IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL!

275
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:15,324
OH!

276
00:11:15,324 --> 00:11:17,727
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF I FEEL RIGHT ABOUT THIS.

277
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:20,529
OH, M MON, MON, M M MONICA...

278
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:23,332
THIS IS THE HONEYMOON SUITE.

279
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:25,334
THE ROOM EXPECTS SEX.

280
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:30,139
THE ROOM WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED IF IT DIDN'T GET SEX.

281
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:32,541
ALL OF THE OTHER HONEYMOON SUITES

282
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,143
WOULD THINK IT WAS A LOSER.

283
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:36,545
OKAY.

284
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:37,747
OKAY.

285
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:40,149
EMILY?

286
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:42,151
NOPE, NOT UNDER HERE.

287
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:45,755
YOU DIDN'T FIND HER?

288
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:47,356
NO. I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

289
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:49,358
WELL, YOU COULDN'T HAVE LOOKED EVERYWHERE

290
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:50,960
OR ELSE YOU WOULD'VE FOUND HER.

291
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,161
YEAH, I THINK YOU SHOULD KEEP LOOKING.

292
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:53,763
YEAH, FOR ABOUT, UH, 30 MINUTES.

293
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:54,964
OR 45.

294
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,970
WOW, IN 45 MINUTES, YOU COULD FIND HER TWICE.

295
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,173
NO. FOR ALL I KNOW

296
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:06,976
SHE'S TRYING TO FIND ME BUT COULDN'T

297
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,378
BECAUSE I KEPT MOVING AROUND.

298
00:12:09,378 --> 00:12:12,581
NO, FROM NOW ON, I'M STAYING IN ONE PLACE.

299
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:13,783
RIGHT HERE.

300
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,587
WELL, IT'S GETTING LATE.

301
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:19,388
YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO GO.

302
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:20,589
WELL, ACTUALLY...

303
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:24,593
YOU GUYS MIND STAYING HERE FOR A WHILE?

304
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:26,595
YOU KNOW, UM, WE GOT TO GET UP EARLY

305
00:12:26,595 --> 00:12:28,597
AND CATCH THAT PLANE TO NEW YORK.

306
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:30,599
YEAH, IT'S A VERY LARGE PLANE.

307
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,603
THAT'S COOL.

308
00:12:36,205 --> 00:12:39,809
BUT WE'LL STAY HERE WITH YOU.

309
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:41,761
THANKS, GUYS!

310
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,264
I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS, YOU KNOW?

311
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,266
BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO RUB MY BUTT.

312
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,034
WE HAVE TO LEAVE FOR NEW YORK IN AN HOUR.

313
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,036
I KNOW. I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THOSE DOORS.

314
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,689
THEY LOOK PRETTY SOUNDPROOF, DON'T YOU THINK?

315
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,291
WE CAN'T DO THAT.

316
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,492
THAT'S INSANE.

317
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,895
I MEAN, A: HE COULD WAKE UP,

318
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,496
AND B: YOU KNOW...

319
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,098
LET'S GO FOR IT.

320
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,301

321
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:24,703
EMIL... EMILY?

322
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:25,905
EM... EMILY!

323
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,508
EMILY!

324
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,510
NO.

325
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,913
YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT EMILY, SHE'S NOT WITH US.

326
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,114
WE'VE COME FOR HER THINGS.

327
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,116
WH WHERE IS SHE?

328
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:37,917
SHE'S IN HIDING.

329
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,518
SHE'S UTTERLY HUMILIATED.

330
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,520
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE YOU EVER AGAIN.

331
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,923
WE'RE VERY SAD THAT IT DIDN'T WORK OUT

332
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,524
BETWEEN YOU AND EMILY...

333
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,126
MONKEY.

334
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:52,331
BUT I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.

335
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,333
EXCUSE ME.

336
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,136
I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE.

337
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,538
OH, YES.

338
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,941
THERE YOU ARE.

339
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:04,743
HEY! HEY, YOU GUYS!

340
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:05,945
GO HURRY UP, GET SOME.

341
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,546
THERE'S A WHOLE CART OUTSIDE.

342
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,148
BYE, GELLER.

343
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,150
WAIT, HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

344
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,751
LOOK, LOOK... YOUR DAUGHTER AND I

345
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,554
ARE SUPPOSED TO LEAVE TONIGHT FOR OUR HONEYMOON.

346
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,757
NOW... NOW, YOU TELL HER THAT I'M GOING TO BE AT THAT AIRPORT

347
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,759
AND I HOPE THAT SHE'LL BE THERE, TOO.

348
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,761
OH, YEAH, I SAID RACHEL'S NAME

349
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,363
BUT IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING, OKAY?

350
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,965
SHE'S JUST A FRIEND. THAT'S ALL.

351
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,367
NOW, LOOK, JUST TELL EMILY THAT I LOVE HER

352
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,168
AND THAT I CAN'T IMAGINE

353
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,570
SPENDING MY LIFE WITH ANYONE ELSE.

354
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,174
PLEASE, PROMISE ME THAT YOU'LL TELL HER THAT.

355
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:38,377
ALL RIGHT. I'LL TELL HER.

356
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,779
COME ON, BUGGER FACE.

357
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,381
CALL ME.

358
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,584
YOU SPEND HALF YOUR LIFE IN THE BATHROOM.

359
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,787
WHY DO YOU NEVER GO OUT THE BLOODY WINDOW?

360
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,005
YOU KNOW...

361
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:09,208
MAYBE IT'S BEST WE NEVER GOT TO DO IT AGAIN.

362
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,411
YEAH, IT KIND OF MAKES THAT ONE NIGHT SPECIAL.

363
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,616
YOU KNOW, TECHNICALLY

364
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:20,019
WE STILL ARE OVER INTERNATIONAL WATERS.

365
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,620
I'M GOING TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

366
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,622
MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU THERE IN A BIT?

367
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,224
OKAY.

368
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,033
HEY, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

369
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,435
UH... NO.

370
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,037
FELICITY AND I

371
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,638
WE'RE WATCHING MY GIANT, RIGHT?

372
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:42,041
AND I WAS THINKING, I'M NEVER GOING TO BE

373
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,043
AS GOOD AN ACTOR AS THAT GIANT.

374
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,845
DO YOU THINK I'M JUST WASTING MY LIFE

375
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,047
WITH THIS ACTING THING?

376
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,449
NO.

377
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,650
I MEAN, THE GIANT'S, LIKE,

378
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,252
FIVE YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME, YOU KNOW?

379
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,853
YOU THINK I'LL EVER GET THERE?

380
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,057
YES.

381
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:00,859
THANKS, MAN.

382
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,461
OKAY, MAN.

383
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,063
BUT WHAT ABOUT

384
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,465
HOW MUCH TALLER HE IS THAN ME?

385
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,867
I MEAN, THERE'S NO WAY I CAN MAKE MYSELF TALLER NOW.

386
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,469
YOU KNOW?

387
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,473
AND WHO KNOWS WHAT SCIENCE WILL COME UP WITH IN THE FUTURE.

388
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,475
BUT, CHANDLER, WHAT IF I DIE

389
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,477
AN UNSUCCESSFUL, REGULAR SIZE MAN?

390
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,280
HEY, MONICA.

391
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,282
YOU BEEN IN THE BATHROOM FOR, LIKE, A HALF HOUR.

392
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,284
I KNOW.

393
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,087
HAD THE BEEF TIPS, HUH?

394
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,298

395
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,300
HEY!

396
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,302
HEY! HI!

397
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,704

398
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:46,905
YOU ATE MEAT.

399
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,909
YOU HAD SEX.

400
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,113
NO, WE DIDN'T.

401
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,714
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T.

402
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,716
I WAS TALKING ABOUT MONICA.

403
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,519
PHOEBE, I DID NOT HAVE SEX.

404
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,939
OH, THIS PREGNANCY IS THROWING ME ALL OFF.

405
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,941
AND MAKING ME FAT.

406
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,976
I'm GOING TO GO SAY HI TO THE CHICK AND THE DUCK.

407
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:08,777
OH, ME, TOO.

408
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,379
WHY WOULD YOU NEED TO SAY HI TO THEM?

409
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:11,980
YOU'VE BEEN FEEDING THEM FOR FOUR DAYS.

410
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,182
OH, RIGHT.

411
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:14,783
MAYBE I'LL JUST GO HOME.

412
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:27,196
WELL, WE CERTAINLY ARE ALONE.

413
00:17:27,196 --> 00:17:29,998
YES, GOOD THING WE HAD THAT "NOT IN NEW YORK" RULE.

414
00:17:29,998 --> 00:17:32,401
RIGHT.

415
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:35,604
UM, LISTEN, SINCE WE'RE ON THAT SUBJECT...

416
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:37,606
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT...

417
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:40,809
WELL, I WAS GOING THROUGH A REALLY HARD TIME IN LONDON

418
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,811
WHAT WITH MY BROTHER GETTING MARRIED

419
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,214
AND THAT GUY THINKING I WAS ROSS'S MOTHER.

420
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:47,616
RIGHT.

421
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:50,819
WELL, ANYWAY, I JUST...

422
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,020
THAT NIGHT MEANT A LOT TO ME

423
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,022
AND I GUESS I'M TRYING TO SAY THANKS.

424
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:56,024
OH.

425
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:00,829
YOU KNOW, THAT NIGHT MEANT A LOT TO ME, TOO.

426
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:04,433
AND IT WASN'T BECAUSE I WAS IN A BAD PLACE OR ANYTHING.

427
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:06,034
IT JUST MEANT A LOT TO ME

428
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:07,636
BECAUSE... YOU'RE REALLY HOT.

429
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,242
IS THAT OKAY?

430
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:14,843
THAT'S OKAY.

431
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,845
AND I'M CUTE, TOO.

432
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:20,449
AND YOU'RE CUTE, TOO.

433
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:22,050
THANK YOU.

434
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,652
ALL RIGHT. I'VE GOT TO GO UNPACK.

435
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:25,254
OKAY.

436
00:18:28,056 --> 00:18:30,859
BYE.

437
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,072
I'M STILL ON LONDON TIME.

438
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:45,274
DOES THAT COUNT?

439
00:18:46,074 --> 00:18:47,676
OH, THAT COUNTS.

440
00:18:47,676 --> 00:18:49,278
OH, GOOD.

441
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,086
RACH!

442
00:18:58,086 --> 00:18:59,288
RACH!

443
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:00,889
HI.

444
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,491
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

445
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:06,094
WELL, I'VE BEEN ON STANDBY FOR A FLIGHT HOME FOR HOURS.

446
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:07,696
OH.

447
00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:09,298
OH... SO NO SIGN OF EMILY, HUH?

448
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:10,899
NOT YET.

449
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:18,106
SO, UM... WHAT TIME ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO LEAVE?

450
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:21,310
This is the last call for flight 1066 to Athens.

451
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,911
The last call.

452
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,913
PRETTY SOON, I GUESS.

453
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,915
YEAH.

454
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:30,519
I'M SORRY.

455
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,521
I JUST... I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

456
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:34,523
I MEAN, HOW COULD SHE DO THIS?

457
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:36,525
AM I, AM I LIKE A COMPLETE IDIOT

458
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:38,927
FOR THINKING SHE'D ACTUALLY SHOW UP?

459
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:42,130
NO, YOU'RE NOT AN IDIOT, ROSS.

460
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,933
YOU'RE A GUY VERY MUCH IN LOVE.

461
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,336
SAME DIFFERENCE.

462
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:50,939
All ticketed passengers for flight 1066 to Athens

463
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,541
should now be on board.

464
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,943
I GET IT!

465
00:19:57,346 --> 00:19:59,348
WELL, THAT'S THAT.

466
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,551
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

467
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:04,152
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO.

468
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:05,754
WHAT?

469
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:06,955
YEAH, I DO.

470
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,957
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO BY YOURSELF.

471
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,158
GET SOME DISTANCE.

472
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:11,360
CLEAR YOUR HEAD.

473
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,362
I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD.

474
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:14,963
OH, I DON'T, I DON'T KNOW.

475
00:20:15,364 --> 00:20:16,164
OH, COME ON, ROSS.

476
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:18,166
I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD FOR YOU.

477
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,768
I... I... I COULD.

478
00:20:19,768 --> 00:20:22,170
I I COULD DO THAT.

479
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,172
YEAH.

480
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:26,975
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE HER.

481
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,977
YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM GOING TO GO.

482
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,178
GOOD.

483
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:31,380
WHY NOT? RIGHT? RIGHT! RIGHT!

484
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,981
THANKS.

485
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,583
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU BACK AT HOME...

486
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,985
ALL RIGHT. IF I EVER GET A FLIGHT OUT OF HERE.

487
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,587
HEY, WH...

488
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:39,788
NAH.

489
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:42,190
WHAT? WAIT. WHAT?

490
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:45,394
WHY DON'T YOU COME?

491
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:47,396
I MEAN, I HAVE TWO TICKETS.

492
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:48,597
WHY NOT?

493
00:20:48,597 --> 00:20:52,200
WELL, ROSS, I...

494
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,202
REALLY?

495
00:20:54,202 --> 00:20:56,204
YEAH, YEAH, IT'D BE GREAT.

496
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:59,808
I MEAN, YOU CAN... YOU CAN LAY ON THE BEACH

497
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:02,611
AND I CAN CRY OVER MY FAILED MARRIAGE.

498
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:04,212
SEE HOW I MAKE JOKES?

499
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:05,814
UH HUH.

500
00:21:05,814 --> 00:21:07,416
NO, REALLY, I MEAN...

501
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,818
GOD, I COULD USE A FRIEND.

502
00:21:09,818 --> 00:21:13,422
OH, WOW, OKAY... UH, MAYBE.

503
00:21:13,822 --> 00:21:15,824
UM...

504
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:17,426
YES, I CAN DO THAT.

505
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:19,027
OKAY, COOL. COME ON.

506
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,629
ALL RIGHT, COOL.

507
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:22,230
THERE.

508
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,633
OKAY, WE'RE GOING TO GREECE. YEAH, OKAY.

509
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,635
AH! AH, I FORGOT MY JACKET.

510
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:28,236
TELL THEM TO WAIT.

511
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:29,438
OKAY.

512
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:31,039
 WAIT! WAIT!

513
00:21:35,844 --> 00:21:38,647
EMILY.

514
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,852
OH, NO, NO, NO.

515
00:21:43,852 --> 00:21:45,454
NO, NO...

516
00:21:45,454 --> 00:21:47,055
NO! NO!

517
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,657
GEE! EMILY!

518
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,379
YES, I WILL HAVE A GLASS OF THE MERLOT

519
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,182
AND HE WILL HAVE A WHITE WINE SPRITZER.

520
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,784
OKAY. I'LL BE BACK SHORTLY.

521
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,387
WHOO.

522
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:03,588

523
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:06,391
HEY, LOOK AT THAT, THE AIRPORT'S MOVING.

524
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,794
HEY, ARE WE MOVING?

525
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:09,995
ARE WE MOVING?

526
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,196
WHY ARE WE MOVING?

527
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,798
THAT DOESN'T...

528
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,600
UM, YEAH, DOES THE CAPTAIN KNOW THAT WE'RE MOVING?

529
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,003
OH, MY GOSH.
