1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,509

2
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,514
HEY.

3
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,523
MONICA?

4
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,525
WHAT TIME IS IT?

5
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,029
AH, 9:00.

6
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,031
BUT IT'S DARK OUT.

7
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:36,036
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS SLEEP TILL NOON, SILLY.

8
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,538
THIS IS WHAT 9:00 LOOKS LIKE.

9
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,540
I GUESS I'LL GET WASHED UP THEN.

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,044
WATCH THAT SUN RISE.

11
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,050
I'M REALLY GETTING TIRED OF SNEAKING AROUND ALL THE TIME.

12
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,551
I KNOW. ME TOO. HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

13
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,553
WHAT IF WE WENT AWAY FOR THE WHOLE WEEKEND?

14
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,055
YOU KNOW, HAD NO INTERRUPTIONS.

15
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,556
AND WE COULD BE NAKED THE ENTIRE TIME.

16
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,557
ALL WEEKEND?

17
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,060
THAT'S A WHOLE LOT OF NAKED.

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,562
YEAH, I COULD SAY THAT I HAVE A CONFERENCE

19
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,564
AND YOU CAN SAY YOU HAVE A CHEF THING.

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,067
OH, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO TO THIS CULINARY FAIR

21
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,068
THAT THEY HAVE IN JERSEY.

22
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,070
OKAY, YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT, THOUGH.

23
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,572
LET'S GO.

24
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,575
WAIT, WHAT ABOUT JOEY?

38
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,132
HEY, GUESS WHAT I'M DOING THIS WEEKEND?

39
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,134
GOING TO THIS CULINA RY FAIR IN JERSEY.

40
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,635
HOW WEIRD.

41
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,138
CHANDLER JUST TOLD US HE'S GOT A CONFERENCE THERE.

42
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,140
OH, WELL, THAT'S FUNNY.

43
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,642
SEEMS LIKE CHANDLER'S CONFERENCE

44
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,146
COULD HAVE BEEN IN CONNECTICUT OR VERMONT.

45
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,150
I'M NOT IN CHARGE OF WHE RE THE CONFERENCE IS HELD.

46
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,154
DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO THINK IT'S A FAKE CONFERENCE?

47
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,156
IT'S A REAL CONFERENCE.

48
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,160
HEY. IS RACHEL HERE? I'VE GOT TO TALK TO HER.

49
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,161
NO, SHE'S OUT SHOPPING.

50
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,662
DAMN.

51
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,664
WHAT'S GOING ON?

52
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,666
I TOLD EMILY TO COME

53
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,670
AND I JUST NEED TO, YOU KNOW, TALK TO RACHEL ABOUT IT.

54
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,172
WAIT A MINUTE.

55
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,673
SO, WHEN EMILY COMES

56
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,177
YOU'RE JUST, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE RACHEL ANYMORE?

57
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,678
WELL, LOOK. I'M JUST TRYING TO FOCUS

58
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,181
ON THE "I GET TO SEE MY WIFE" PART, ALL RIGHT.

59
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,183
AND NOT ON THE PART THAT MAKES ME DO THIS.

60
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,687
WOW, SO YOU GUYS, YOU'RE NEVER GOING

61
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,689
TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER?

62
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,191
HOW IS THAT EVEN GOING TO WORK?

63
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,692
I HAVE NO IDEA.

64
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,696
I MEAN, BUT I ASSURE YOU, I WILL FIGURE IT OUT.

65
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,201
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S GOING TO WORK.

66
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,703
HI, GUYS.

67
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,705
HI. HEY.

68
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,207
WHAT'S GOING ON?

69
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,710
WE'RE FLIPPING MONICA'S MATTRESS.

70
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:37,717
SO I'M THINKING BASICALLY, WE PICK IT UP AND THEN WE FLIP IT.

71
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,221
THAT'S BETTER THAN MY WAY.

72
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,225
OH, OKAY. HEY, GUYS. WOULD YOU FLIP MINE TOO?

73
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,228

74
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:53,233
OH, LOOK. A LETTER FROM MY MOM.

75
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,237
SO, RACH...

76
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,739
YOU KNOW HOW EMILY IS COMING, RIGHT?

77
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,741
OH, YEAH. I KNOW.

78
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,743
CAN YOU HEAR ANYTHING?

79
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,246
OH, YES. SOMEBODY JUST SAID, "CAN YOU HEAR ANYTHING?"

80
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,254
HEY, JOEY'S ASS.

81
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,757
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

82
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,759
WELL, REMEMBER WHEN THEY GOT INTO THAT BIG FIGHT

83
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,262
AND BROKE UP AND WE WERE ALL STUCK IN HERE ALL NIGHT

84
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,263
WITH NO FOOD OR ANYTHING?

85
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,765
WELL, WHEN ROSS SAID RACHELAT THE WEDDING

86
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,768
I FIGURED IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN, YOU KNOW.

87
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,270
SO I HID THIS IN HERE.

88
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,272
OOH. CANDY BARS, CROSSWORD PUZZLES.

89
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,775
OOH, MAD LIBS, MINE.

90
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,778
OKAY, "NAME OF SOMEONE IN ROOM."

91
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,279
CHANDLER.

92
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,281
COME ON, SERIOUSLY.

93
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,287
ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU GOT IN HERE-- MAGAZINES TO READ AT...

94
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,288
CONDOMS?

95
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,294
HEY, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE'RE GOING TO BE IN HERE.

96
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,296
WE MAY HAVE TO REPOPULATE THE EARTH.

97
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,800
AND CONDOMS ARE THE WAY TO DO THAT?

98
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:07,307
ANYWAY, IT IT KIND OF ALL BOILS DOWN TO THIS.

99
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,309
THE LAST TIME I TALKED TO EMILY...

100
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,811
OH, MY GOD! OUR DOG DIED.

101
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,314
WHAT?

102
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,817
OH, OUR DOG, LAPOOH.

103
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,821
LAPOOH'S STILL ALIVE?

104
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,822
OOH!

105
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,823
OH! OOH...

106
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,325
SORRY.

107
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:30,330
OH, IT SAYS HE WAS HIT BY AN ICE CREAM TRUCK.

108
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,334
AND DRAGGED FOR NINE... TEEN BLOCKS.

109
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,335
OH, MY GOD.

110
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,838
SWEETIE, WE HEARD YOU CRYING.

111
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,340
PLEASE DON'T CRY.

112
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,841
IT'S LAPOOH.

113
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,344
I KNOW, IT'S LAPOOH RIGHT NOW, BUT IT WILL GET BETTER.

114
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,853
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. WE'RE HERE.

115
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,358
OOH, CHOCOLATES ON THE PILLOWS. OH, I LOVE THAT.

116
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,860
OH, YOU SHOULD LIVE WITH JOEY. ROLLOS EVERYWHERE.

117
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,363
THIS IS SO GREAT.

118
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,864
NO ONE'S GOING TO CO ME IN AND BOTHER US

119
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,866
AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.

120
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,369
I'M GOING TO DO  IT WITH MONICA!

121
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:10,870
CHANDLER...

122
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,873
CHANDLER, STOP YELLING THAT YOU AND I ARE GOING TO DO IT!

123
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,876
OH, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

124
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,378
OKAY.

125
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,882

126
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,883
OH, YES.

127
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,884
MONICA, GET IN HERE.

128
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,387
IT'S A HIGH SPEED CAR CHASE ON.

129
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,390
WE'RE SWITCHING ROOMS.

130
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,392
OH, DEAR GOD. THEY GAVE US GLASSES.

131
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,894
NO, THEY GAVE US GLASSES WITH LIPSTICK ON THEM.

132
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,896
I MEAN... IF THEY DIDN'T CHANGE THE GLASSES

133
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,898
WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE THEY DIDN'T CHANGE.

134
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,901
YOU WANT TO SWITCH ROOMS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T CHANGE THE GLASSES?

135
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,903
NO, I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING

136
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,905
BUT THE CARPET SMELLS, TOO.

137
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,407
OH, COME ON. I JUST...

138
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,909
I WANT THIS WEEKEND TO BE PERFECT, OKAY?

139
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,911
WE CAN CHANGE ROOMS, CAN'T WE? OKAY.

140
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,913
OKAY, BUT LET'S DO IT NOW, THOUGH

141
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,415
BECAUSE CHOPPER 5 JUST LOST ITS FEED.

142
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,422
?? LA LA LA ??

143
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,923

144
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,425
?? LA LA LA ??

145
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,426

146
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,927
?? LA LA LA... ??

147
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,931
FORGET IT.

148
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,441
HEY, SO, UH, YOU KNOW HOW THERE WAS SOMETHING

149
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,943
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT?

150
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,445
OH, YEAH.

151
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,949
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW I'M TRYING TO WORK THINGS OUT WITH EMILY?

152
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,451
MM HMM.

153
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,955
WELL, THERE'S THIS ONE THING.

154
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,458
OKAY...

155
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,460
HERE GOES.

156
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,465
I MADE A PROMISE THAT...

157
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,466
OH, HEY.

158
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,467
WHAT?

159
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,469
YOUR NOSE IS BLEEDING. OH, GOD.

160
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,971
OH, NOT AGAIN.

161
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,973
THIS HAPPENED WHEN MY GRANDFATHER DIED.

162
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,974
IT'S...

163
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,476
I'M SORRY.

164
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,478
OH, GROSS.

165
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,981
OKAY, SO I'M SORRY. WHAT DID YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

166
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,486
UH...

167
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,488

168
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,489
OH!

169
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,491
SORRY. SORRY.

170
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,995
OKAY. I, UH...

171
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,997
I CAN'T SEE YOU ANYMORE.

172
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,999
YEAH, YOU KNOW, I KNOW , IT'S RIDICULOUS.

173
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,000
I CAN'T SEE YOU EITHER.

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,001
ALL RIGHT.

175
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,002
YOU KNOW WHAT?

176
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,004
I'M JUST GOING TO GO SHOVE

177
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,006
A BUNCH OF TISSUES IN MY NOSE.

178
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,008
OH, HEY, DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHILE I DO THAT?

179
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,010
I'M GOOD.

180
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,516
I THINK YOU'LL FIND THIS ROOM MORE TO YOUR LIKING.

181
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,017
OKAY, GREAT.

182
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,022
THEY SAY HE'S ONLY GOT HALF A TANK LEFT.

183
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:48,027
HALF A TANK? WE STILL GOT A LOT OF HIGH SPEED CHASING TO DO.

184
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,030
I'LL BET HE'S HEADING FOR CANADA.

185
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,031
THEY ALWAYS DO.

186
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,033
WE'RE SWITCHING ROOMS AGAIN.

187
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,535
WHAT? WHY?

188
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,538
THIS IS A GARDEN VIEW ROOM AND WE PAID FOR AN OCEAN VIEW ROOM.

189
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:03,042
OUR LAST OCEAN VIEW ROOM WAS UNACCEPTABLE TO YOU.

190
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,044
THE CARPET SMELLED.

191
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,546
LIKE OCEAN?

192
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,048
NO, LIKE FEET.

193
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,051
EXCUSE ME.

194
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,053
UM, CAN I TALK TO YOU OVER HERE FOR JUST A SECOND?

195
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,054
UH HUH.

196
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:19,058
CHANDLER?

197
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,059
YEAH.

198
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,561
OKAY, LOOK.

199
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,063
THESE CLOWNS ARE TRYING TO TAKE US FOR A RIDE

200
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,064
AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET THEM.

201
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,066
NOW, WE'RE NOT A COUPLE OF SUCKERS.

202
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,569
I HEAR YA, MUGSY.

203
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,072
BUT LOOK, ALL THESE ROOMS ARE FINE, OKAY.

204
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,575
CAN YOU JUST PICK  ONE SO I CAN WATCH THE...

205
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,579
HAVE A PERFECT MAGICAL WEEKEND TOGETHER WITH YOU?

206
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,580
WHOA!

207
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,584
OH, MAN, HE ALMOST HIT A GAS TRUCK.

208
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,087
DO YOU EVER WATCH BAYWATCH?

209
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,596
OKAY, THIS ONE I LIKE.

210
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,597
NOTHING.

211
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,098
NOTHING, IT'S OVER.

212
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,601
DAMN IT. THIS IS REGULARLY SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING.

213
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,604
I WANT TO SEE THEM TALK TO HIS NEIGHBORS.

214
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,105
WELL, I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE.

215
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,607
YOU COULD TALK TO ME.

216
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,108
YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIM.

217
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,111
CAN WE TURN THE TV OFF, OKAY?

218
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,615
DO WE REALLY WANT TO SPEND THE ENTIRE WEEKEND LIKE THIS?

219
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,617
OH, I'M SORRY. AM  I GETTING IN THE WAY

220
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,118
OF ALL THE ROOM SWITCHING FUN?

221
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,121
DON'T BLAME ME FOR RUINING TONIGHT.

222
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,122
WELL, WHO SHOULD I BLAME?

223
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,624
THE NICE BELLMAN WHO HAD TO DRAG OUR LUGGAGE

224
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,625
TO TEN DIFFERENT ROOMS?

225
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,126
OH, I DON'T KNOW-- HOW ABOUT THE IDIOT

226
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,128
WHO THOUGHT HE COULD DRIVE FROM ALBANY TO CANADA

227
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,129
ON HALF A TANK OF GAS?

228
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:34,634
DO NOT SPEAK ILL OF THE DEAD.

229
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:39,138
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SPENDING A ROMANTIC WEEKEND TOGETHER.

230
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,641
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

231
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,143
I JUST WANT TO WATCH A LITTLE TELEVISION.

232
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,645
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?

233
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,646
GEEZ, RELAX, MOM.

234
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,650
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

235
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,654
I SAID, GEEZ, RELAX, MONNN.

236
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,657
YOU KNOW WHAT, CHANDLER?

237
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,158
YOU LIKE FAST GETAWAYS?

238
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,660
WATCH THIS.

239
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,163
I DON'T LIKE FAST GETAWAYS.

240
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,165
I LIKE CAR CHASES.

241
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,676
HEY.

242
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,177
WHAT'S UP?

243
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,679
RACHEL, I'VE BEEN WANTING

244
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,681
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING FOR A WHILE NOW

245
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,183
AND I REALLY... I JUST HAVE TO GET IT OUT.

246
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,185
OKAY, ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S UP?

247
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,688
OKAY, BEFORE I TELL YOU, I JUST HAVE TO KNOW...

248
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,189
IF YOUR NOSE OKAY?

249
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,691
YEAH.

250
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,193
ARE ALL THE OTHER FAMILY PETS IN GOOD HEALTH?

251
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,695
WELL, UH, LET'S SEE.

252
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,198
WELL, DAVEY'S STILL PINING AFTER LAPOOH, BUT, YOU KNOW

253
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,200
HE'S A TOUGH LITTLE TURTLE.

254
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,705
YOU KNOW HOW YOU TOLD ME

255
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,208
I SHOULD DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO FIX MY MARRIAGE?

256
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,211
YEAH. I TOLD YOU TO GIVE EMILY WHATEVER SHE WANTS.

257
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,715
AND WHILE THAT WAS GOOD ADVICE

258
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:00,720
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT WHAT SHE WANTS...

259
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,721
YEAH?

260
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:06,225
IS FOR ME NOT TO SEE YOU ANYMORE.

261
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,229
WELL, THAT'S CRAZY. YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

262
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,733
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TELL HER?

263
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:21,741
OH, MY GOD.

264
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,243
YOU'VE ALREADY AGREED TO THIS, HAVEN'T YOU?

265
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,244
IT'S AWFUL, I KNOW.

266
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,246
I... I MEAN, I FEEL TERRIBLE

267
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:31,250
BUT I HAVE TO DO THIS IF I WANT MY MARRIAGE TO WORK.

268
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,251
AND I DO.

269
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,754
I HAVE TO MAKE THIS MARRIAGE WORK.

270
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,255
I HAVE TO.

271
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,760
BUT THE GOOD THING IS

272
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,763
WE CAN STILL SEE EACH OTHER UNTIL SHE GETS HERE.

273
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,767
OH!

274
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,769
OH, LUCKY ME!

275
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,271
OH, MY GOD, THAT IS GOOD NEWS, ROSS.

276
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,773
I THINK THAT'S THE BEST NEWS

277
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,775
I'VE HEARD SINCE LAPOOH DIED.

278
00:12:55,775 --> 00:13:01,781
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT A NIGHTMARE THIS HAS BEEN.

279
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,783
THIS IS SO HARD.

280
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,785
OH, YEAH, REALLY. IS IT, ROSS?

281
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,786
YEAH, OKAY.

282
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,288
WELL, LET ME JUST MAKE THIS A LITTLE EASIER FOR YOU.

283
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,290
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? STORMING OUT.

284
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,792
RACHEL, THIS IS YOUR APARTMENT.

285
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,795
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S HOW MAD I AM.

286
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,808
DAMN ROLLOS!

287
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,310
HEY, YOU'RE BACK. HEY.

288
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,813
HOW WAS YOUR CONFERENCE?

289
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,814
IT WAS TERRIBLE.

290
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,817
I FOUGHT WITH MY COLLEAGUES THE ENTIRE TIME.

291
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,819
ARE YOU KIDDING WITH THIS?

292
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,820

293
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,322
SO YOUR WEEKEND WAS A TOTAL BUST?

294
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,825
UH, NO. I GOT TO SEE DONALD TRUMP WAITING FOR AN ELEVATOR.

295
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,828
YOU KNOW, AT THE TAJ MAHAL

296
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,331
HE HAS HIS OWN PRIVATE GLASS ELEVATOR.

297
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,333
THAT'S RIGHT, MADE BY OTIS ELEVATORS.

298
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,335
AND THEY DON'T USUALLY DO GLASS.

299
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,839
WHAT KINDS OF STUFF DO YOU KNOW?

300
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,842
HI.

301
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,844
HEY, YOU'RE BACK, TOO.

302
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,346
YEAH. CHANDLER, CAN I TALK TO YOU OUTSIDE FOR JUST A SECOND?

303
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,848
HEY, HOW WAS YOUR CHEF THING?

304
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,349
IT WAS AWFUL.

305
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,352
GUESS SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T APPRECIATE REALLY GOOD FOOD.

306
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,354
WELL, MAYBE IT WAS THE KIND OF FOOD

307
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,856
THAT TASTED GOOD AT FIRST

308
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,859
BUT THEN MADE EVERYBODY VOMIT AND HAVE DIARRHEA.

309
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,361
CHANDLER?

310
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,864
MONICA?

311
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,367
OKAY. I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW MUCH THE ROOM WAS

312
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,369
BECAUSE I WANT TO PAY MY HALF.

313
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,370
OKAY, FINE. 300 DOLLARS.

314
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,872
300 DOLLARS?

315
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,874
YEAH. JUST THINK OF IT AS 25 DOLLARS PER ROOM.

316
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,878

317
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,380
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS WOOFING ABOUT?

318
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,382
CHANDLER STOLE A 20 FROM MY PURSE.

319
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,385
NO!

320
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,889
I WAS ONLY STEALING IT BACK-- THE ONE THAT SHE STOLE FROM ME.

321
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,392
STEALING, AND NOW LYING.

322
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,393
YOU KNOW WHAT?

323
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,395
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT

324
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:02,401
I CONSTANTLY FIND MYSELF WITHOUT 20s AND YOU ALWAYS HAVE LOTS.

325
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,408
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE LOOK ON HER FACE.

326
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,911
I DON'T WANT RACHEL TO HATE ME.

327
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,412
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

328
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,413
DO YOU WANT MY ADVICE?

329
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,915
YES, PLEASE.

330
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,916
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE IT.

331
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,918
THAT'S OKAY.

332
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,421
YOU GOT MARRIED TOO FAST.

333
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,423
THAT'S NOT ADVICE.

334
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,925
I TOLD YOU.

335
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,929
I'M GOING TO THE BATHROOM.

336
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,434
MAN, IF ANYONE ASKED ME TO GIVE UP ANY OF YOU

337
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,936
I DON'T THINK I COULD DO IT.

338
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,937
ME, NEITHER.

339
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,939
MAYBE I COULD DO IT.

340
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,944
HI. HI, RACH.

341
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,946
LOOK, I KNOW YOU GUYS HEARD ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

342
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,447
WITH ME AND ROSS

343
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,950
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN OBSESSING ABOUT IT ALL DAY

344
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,952
AND I WOULD JUST LOVE NOT TO TALK ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT?

345
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,455
UH, I DON'T KNOW IF THIS FALLS UNDER THAT CATEGORY

346
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,958
BUT, UH, ROSS  IS RIGHT BACK THERE.

347
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,459
THAT'S NOT ROSS.

348
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,961
OH, NO. NOT THAT GUY.

349
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,963
HE DOES LOOK LIKE HIM, THOUGH.

350
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,966
OKAY. ROSS IS IN THE BATHROOM.

351
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,967
OH, MY GOD.

352
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,968
IT'S HAPPENING.

353
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,469
IT'S ALREADY STARTED.

354
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,470
I'M KIP.

355
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,472
YOU'RE NOT KIP.

356
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,474
DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHO KIP IS?

357
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,976
WHO CARES?

358
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,478
YOU'RE RACHEL.

359
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,481
WHO'S KIP?

360
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,983
KIP, MY OLD ROOMMATE.

361
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,985
YOU KNOW, WE ALL USED TO HANG OUT TOGETHER?

362
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,988
OH, THAT POOR BASTARD.

363
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,489
SEE? YOU TOLD ME THE STORY.

364
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,490
HE AND MONICA DATED.

365
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,992
WHEN THEY BROKE UP

366
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,994
THEY COULDN'T EVEN BE IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER

367
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,496
AND YOU ALL PROMISED YOU WOULD STAY HIS FRIEND

368
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,497
AND WHAT HAPPENED?

369
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:39,999
HE GOT PHASED OUT.

370
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,500
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE PHASED OUT.

371
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,002
WELL, OF COURSE, I AM.

372
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,004
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN TO ROSS.

373
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,005
HE'S YOUR BROTHER.

374
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,506
HE'S YOUR OLD COLLEGE ROOMMATE.

375
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,508
BUT KIP DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE KIP.

376
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,010
WE JUST, WE HANDLED THAT ALL WRONG.

377
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,011
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

378
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,512
YEAH, RACH.

379
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,014
AND IT WAS BEFORE  YOU AND ME WERE AROUND.

380
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,516
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

381
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,021
CHANDLER HAD A MUSTACHE, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

382
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,523
UGH, YOU KNOW, IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TIME

383
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,525
BEFORE SOMEONE HAD TO LEAVE THE GROUP.

384
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,527
I JUST ALWAYS ASSUMED PHOEBE WOULD BE THE ONE TO GO.

385
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,528
UH!

386
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,533
HONEY, COME ON. YOU LIVE FAR AWAY, YOU'RE NOT RELATED

387
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,534
YOU LIFT RIGHT OUT.

388
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,042
HEY.

389
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,543
HEY, MR. BING.

390
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:29,548
THAT HOTEL YOU STAYED AT CALLED.

391
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:33,052
SAID SOMEONE LEFT AN EYELASH CURLER IN YOUR ROOM.

392
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,557
YES, THAT WAS MINE.

393
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,059
BECAUSE I FIGURED

394
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,560
YOU HOOKED UP WITH SOME GIRL AND SHE LEFT IT THERE.

395
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,563
YES, THAT WOULD HAVE MADE MORE SENSE.

396
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,567
YOU KNOW, I DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE I KNOW YOU ANYMORE, MAN.

397
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,570
ALL RIGHT? LOOK

398
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,573
I'M JUST GOING TO ASK YOU THIS ONE TIME, ALL RIGHT?

399
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,575
AND WHATEVER YOU SAY, I'LL BELIEVE YOU.

400
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,578
WERE YOU OR WERE YOU NOT...

401
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,580
ON A GAY CRUISE?

402
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,096
PHOEBE?

403
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:23,602
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE WHOLE LIFTING OUT THING.

404
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,606
LOOK, YOU GOT TO COME WITH ME.

405
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,607
COME WHERE?

406
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,608
WHEREVER I GO.

407
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,609
COME ON.

408
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,112
YOU AND ME-- WE'LL START A NEW GROUP.

409
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,613
WE'RE THE BEST ONES.

410
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,119
OKAY, BUT TRY TO GET JOEY, TOO.

411
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,622
PHEEBS, DO YOU MIND

412
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,125
IF I SPEAK TO RACHEL ALONE FOR A SEC?

413
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,627
OH, SURE. YEAH.

414
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,631
BYE, ROSS...

415
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,133
FOREVER.

416
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,637
HI.

417
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,140
HI. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

418
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,142
ISN'T THIS AGAINST THE RULES?

419
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,146
I TALKED TO MONICA.

420
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,651
LOOK, I'M THE ONE WHO MADE THE CHOICE.

421
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,654
I'M THE ONE WHO'S MAKING THINGS CHANGE

422
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,158
SO I SHOULD BE THE ONE TO, YOU KNOW, STEP BACK.

423
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,159
OH, ROSS...

424
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,161
NO. NO, IT'S OKAY, REALLY.

425
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,662
THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE

426
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,665
WHO JUST SEE THEIR SISTERS AT THANKSGIVING

427
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,668
AND JUST SEE THEIR COLLEGE ROOMMATES AT REUNIONS

428
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,671
AND JUST SEE JOEY AT BURGER KING.

429
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,677
SO, IS... IS THAT BETTER?

430
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,183
NO, IT'S NOT BETTER.

431
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,686
I STILL DON'T GET TO SEE YOU.

432
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,689
WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU DO, RACH?

433
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,692
IF YOU WERE ME, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

434
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,202
WELL, FOR STARTERS

435
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,704
I WOULD HAVE SAID THE RIGHT NAME AT MY WEDDING.

436
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,713
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING.

437
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,219
I KNOW.

438
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,222
I AM SO SORRY.

439
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,725
I KNOW THAT, TOO.

440
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,733

441
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,235
HEY, RACH?

442
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,736
SORRY TO INTERRUPT, BUT PHOEBE SAID

443
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,739
YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT A TRIP OR SOMETHING.

444
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,745
HEY.

445
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,248
HI.

446
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:54,253
I JUST CAME OVER TO DROP OFF... NOTHING.

447
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,758
SO, THAT WEEKEND KIND OF SUCKED, HUH?

448
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,760
YEAH, IT DID.

449
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,263
SO I GUESS THIS IS OVER.

450
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,265
WHAT?

451
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,767
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU AND ME.

452
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,269
I MEAN, IT HAD TO END SOMETIME.

453
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,771
WHY, EXACTLY?

454
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,273
BECAUSE OF THE WEEKEND.

455
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,274
WE HAD A FIGHT.

456
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,276
CHANDLER, THAT'S CRAZY.

457
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,278
IF YOU GIVE  UP EVERY TIME

458
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,280
YOU HAVE A FIGHT WITH SOMEONE

459
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,783
YOU'D NEVER BE WITH ANYONE LONGER THAN...

460
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,787
OH!

461
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:32,791
SO, THIS ISN'T OVER?

462
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:37,296
YOU ARE SO CUTE.

463
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,299
NO, NO.

464
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,301
IT WAS A FIGHT.

465
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,303
YOU DEAL WITH IT AND YOU MOVE ON.

466
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,805
IT'S NOTHING TO FREAK OUT ABOUT.

467
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,807
REALLY? OKAY. GREAT.

468
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,309
AW...

469
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,312
WELCOME TO AN ADULT RELATIONSHIP.

470
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,817
WE'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP?

471
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,322
I'M AFRAID SO.

472
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,823
OKAY.

473
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,330
HEY.

474
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,331
HEY.

475
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,332
OH, HEY, MONICA.

476
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,833
I HEARD YOU SAW DONALD TRUMP

477
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,834
AT YOUR CONVENTION.

478
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,836
YEAH. SAW HIM WAIT ING FOR AN ELEVATOR.

479
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,840
 HEY, RACH, CAN I BORROW

480
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,342
YOUR EYELASH CURLER? I THINK I LOST MINE.

481
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,843
YEAH. IT'S IN THE BATHROOM.

482
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,350
OH!

483
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,853
JOEY, CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

484
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:35,854
OOH! OH!

485
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,356
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

486
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,358
OH! OH! OH!

487
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,362
OH...!

488
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,368
YES.

489
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,870
YES.

490
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,374
YOU AND, AND YOU?

491
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,876
YES, BUT YOU CANNOT TELL ANYONE.

492
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,877
NO ONE KNOWS.

493
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,879
HOW? WHEN?

494
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,381
IT HAPPENED IN LONDON.

495
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,882
IN LONDON?!

496
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,886
THE REASON WE DIDN'T TELL ANYONE

497
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,389
WAS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT.

498
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,890
BUT IT IS A BIG DEAL.

499
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,892
I HAVE TO TELL SOMEONE!

500
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,894
YOU CAN'T.

501
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,396
PLEASE.

502
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,897
NOW, I KNOW THIS IS HARD...

503
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,399
IT IS. IT HURTS.

504
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,902
I KNOW.

505
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,404
PLEASE, PLEASE. WE JUST DON'T WANT

506
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,406
TO DEAL WITH TELLING EVERYONE, OKAY?

507
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,907
JUST PROMISE YOU WON'T TELL.

508
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,914
ALL RIGHT!

509
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,417
MAN, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

510
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,919
I MEAN, IT'S GREAT!

511
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,920
BUT...

512
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,922
I KNOW, IT'S GREAT.

513
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:48,427
AW, I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT.

514
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,432
WE'RE SO STUPID.

515
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,434
DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?

516
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,935
THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE JOEY.

517
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,443
"AND THE MOST POPULAR PHOEBE IN TENNIS

518
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,445
"IS CALLED THE 'OVERHAND PHOEBE'

519
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,946
"AND IF YOU WIN, YOU MUST SLAP

520
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,450
YOUR OPPONENT ON THE PHOEBE AND SAY, 'MY PHOEBE.'"

521
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,453
THAT'S CUTE.

522
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,955
WE REALLY ALL ENJOYED IT, BUT YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T COUNT.

523
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:17,956
COUNT FOR WHAT?

524
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,960
JUST COUNT IN OUR HEADS AS GOOD MAD LIBS.

525
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,463
I'M DONE. IT'S OVER.

526
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,966
NOW, WAIT. WAIT, GUYS, IF WE FOLLOW THE RULES

527
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,469
IT'S STILL FUN AND IT MEANS SOMETHING.

528
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,471
I'M GOING TO TAKE OFF.

529
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,972
GUYS, RULES ARE GO OD.

530
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,475
RULES HELP CONTROL THE FUN.
