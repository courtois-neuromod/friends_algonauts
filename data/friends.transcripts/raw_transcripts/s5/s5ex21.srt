1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,503
I'M GOING TO GET SOME MORE COFFEE TO GO.

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,005
DO YOU WANT ANYTHING, BABY DOLL?

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,506
I'M FINE. THANKS.

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,508
YEAH, SEE, I CAN'T PULL OFF "BABY DOLL," CAN I?

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,011
NO. I THINK WE LEARNED THAT

6
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,512
FROM THE "SUGAR LIPS" INCIDENT.

7
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,014
I'M GOING TO GET SOME TEA.

8
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,516
HOW YOU DOING, PUNKIN?

9
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,019
NOPE.

10
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,521
SO, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING REALLY WELL FOR YOU TWO, HUH?

11
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,522
I KNOW, REALLY WELL. IN FACT...

12
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,524
I'M GOING TO ASK PHOEBE TO MOVE IN WITH ME.

13
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,026
OH, MY GOD.

14
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,027
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

15
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,028
I THINK THAT IS SO GREAT.

16
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,529
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO ASK HER?

17
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,531
TONIGHT, BUT DON'T SAY ANYTHING, OKAY?

18
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,033
I SWEAR. I PROMISE , I PROMISE.

19
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,534
MY GOD, I'M SO EXCITED.

20
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,036
ALL RIGHT, BUT LISTEN, LET ME TELL YOU:

21
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,537
DO NOT GET HER FLOWERS, OKAY?

22
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,039
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, SHE CRIES WHEN THEY DIE

23
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,041
AND THEN THERE'S THE WHOLE FUNERAL...

24
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,044
I'LL SEE YOU AFTER WORK, SWEETIE.

25
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,046
OKAY. BYE.

26
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,050
SO, WHAT MOVIE SHOULD WE SEE?

27
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,552
GARY'S GOING TO ASK YOU TO MOVE IN WITH HIM!

28
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,555
WHAT? REALLY?

29
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,057
HE JUST TOLD ME AT THE COUNTER.

30
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,058
HE MADE ME PROMISE NOT TO TELL

31
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,559
BUT I COULDN'T HOLD IT IN ANY LONGER.

32
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,062
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

33
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,563
RIGHT, BUT BECAUSE IT'S FAST.

34
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,565
BECAUSE IT'S SO FAST. IT'S FAST.

35
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,568
RELAX. IT'S PHOEBE , NOT YOU.

36
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,571
OH. GOOD FOR YOU, PHEEBS. WAY TO GO.

37
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,573
BUT IT IS FAST, ISN'T IT?

38
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,075
OH...

39
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,077
I LIKE HIM A LOT, BUT I DON'T THINK I'M READY FOR THIS.

40
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,078
SO, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

41
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,579
I DON'T KNOW. I'LL JUST HANDLE IT.

42
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,081
I'LL ASK YOU TO TALK TO HIM.

43
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,583
ME? WHY ME?

44
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,585
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO AFRAID OF COMMITMENT.

45
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,087
YOU TALK TO HIM.

46
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,088
MAKE HIM SCARED LIKE YOU.

47
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,589
MAKE HIM A MAN.

48
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,590
I'LL TRY, BUT I'M NOT SURE

49
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,592
WHAT GOOD IT WOULD DO, YOU KNOW

50
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,095
BECAUSE I'M A LOT LESS AFRAID OF COMMITMENT

51
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,096
THAN I USED TO BE.

52
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,598
OH, THAT IS SO SWEET.

53
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,599
STILL TERRIFIED.

54
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,101
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. NO PROBLEM.

69
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,656
HEY, ROSS, IS, UH...

70
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,159
IS STATEN ISLAND REALLY AN ISLAND?

71
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,160
UH HUH.

72
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,162
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT STATEN ISLAND.

73
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,665
OH. I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE LONG ISLAND.

74
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,172
ALSO AN ISLAND.

75
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,175
HEY, WHAT TIME IS IT?

76
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,176
2:17.

77
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,178
WOW, YOU REALIZE WE'VE BEEN THROWING THIS BALL

78
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,679
WITHOUT DROPPING IT FOR, LIKE, AN HOUR?

79
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,682
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

80
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,185
I REALIZED IT A HALF HOUR AGO, BUT DIDN'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING

81
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,686
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO JINX IT.

82
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,188
OH.

83
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,190
WOW, WE ARE PRETTY GOOD AT THIS.

84
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,691
YEAH.

85
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,693
HEY... WE TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT LUNCH.

86
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:17,197
OH. I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER MISSED A MEAL.

87
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,198
YEAH?

88
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,700
YEAH. I THINK MY PANTS ARE A LITTLE LOOSE.

89
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,207
HEY, YOU GUYS, UH... IS MONICA HERE?

90
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,708
NO. NO. ALL RIGHT, LISTEN

91
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,709
I JUST BOUGHT SOMETHING.

92
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,211
I'M NOT SURE SHE'S GOING TO LIKE IT

93
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,712
AND IT'S GOING TO SEEM A LITTLE CRAZY

94
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,214
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE WANTED

95
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,215
SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

96
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,217
YOU BOUGHT SHAUN CASSIDY!

97
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,719
NO. I WISH.

98
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,221
OKAY... YOU READY?

99
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,722
YEAH. YEAH.

100
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,224
OKAY.

101
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,227
CHECK IT OUT.

102
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,233
OH, MY GOD! WHAT WHAT IS...

103
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,235
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

104
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,238
IT'S IT'S A CAT.

105
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,739
THAT IS NOT A CAT.

106
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,242
YES, IT IS.

107
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,744
WHY IS IT INSIDE OUT?

108
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,749
EXCUSE ME

109
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,254
BUT THIS IS A PUREBRED, SHOW QUALITY SPHINX CAT.

110
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,257
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR THAT?

111
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,259
IT WAS EXTRAVAGANT, BUT I GOT A PRETTY GOOD DEAL.

112
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,760
YEAH? HOW MUCH?

113
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,761
A THOUSAND BUCKS.

114
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,265
ON A CAT?!

115
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,268
IT'S NOT A CAT.

116
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,770
FOR $1,000, YOU'D THINK

117
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,273
AT LEAST IT WOULD COME WITH HAIR.

118
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,276
OR SOMETHING.

119
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,278
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, BALL BOYS.

120
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,780
MY GRANDMOTHER HAD ONE OF THESE WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL

121
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,282
AND IT WAS THE SWEETEST THING.

122
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,783
I MEAN, IT WAS SO CUTE.

123
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,785
IT WOULD SIT IN MY LAP AND JUST PURR ALL DAY LONG

124
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,787
AND I WOULD DRAG A SHOESTRING ON THE GROUND

125
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,788
AND IT WOULD CHASE IT.

126
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,291
FREE CATS DO THAT, TOO, YOU KNOW.

127
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,793
IT'S NOT A CAT!

128
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,296
LOOK, YOU GUYS, I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

129
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,797
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK.

130
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,800
I'M GOING TO GO SET UP A LITTER BOX FOR MRS. WHISKERSON.

131
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,305
WELL, WHAT AM I GOING TO CALL HER-- FLUFFY?

132
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,310
YOU WANT TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT

133
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,811
OR DO YOU WANT TO SEE HOW LONG

134
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,313
WE CAN THROW THIS BALL BACK AND FORTH, HUH?

135
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,315
UH... THE BALL THING.

136
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,316
YEAH?

137
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,818
HEY, ROSS, WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT

138
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,321
IF WE COULD GO FOR, LIKE, TWO STRAIGHT HOURS

139
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,323
WITHOUT DROPPING IT?

140
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,825
UH... YEAH, IT WOULD.

141
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,328
LET'S DO IT.

142
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,829
OKAY.

143
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,333
UH OH.

144
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,334
WHAT?

145
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,835
I HAVE TO PEE

146
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,338
AND RACHEL'S IN THE BATHROOM.

147
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,844
MAN, I DIDN'T THINK WE WERE GOING TO MAKE IT.

148
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,347
I KNOW.

149
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,849
DON'T SWITCH HANDS, OKAY?

150
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,859
HEY, LADIES, WHAT ARE YOU IN HERE FOR?

151
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,363

152
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,365
HEY, CHANDLER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

153
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,366
GARY, I AM HERE

154
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,368
TO REPORT A CRIME.

155
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,870
YEAH? IT IS A CRIME THAT YOU AND I DON'T SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER.

156
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,372
WHAT'S UP?

157
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,874
UH, WELL, I HEARD THAT YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT

158
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,376
ASKING PHOEBE TO MOVE IN WITH YOU

159
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,378
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE A TALK

160
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,381
YOU KNOW, MAN TO... WELL, ME.

161
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,383
SURE. OKAY.

162
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,384
OKAY.

163
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,386
UM, ARE YOU CRAZY?

164
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,887
ARE YOU INSANE?

165
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,889
IF YOU LIVE WITH PHOEBE

166
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,392
YOU TWO ARE GOING TO BE, YOU KNOW, L LIVING TOGETHER.

167
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,393
YEAH. I CONSIDERED THAT.

168
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,894
I JUST KNOW IT'D MAKE ME HAPPY.

169
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,396
YOU MEAN SCARED.

170
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,397
NO, I MEAN HAPPY.

171
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,400
WELL, "SCARED HAPPY.2

172
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,901
CHANDLER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

173
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,903
I AM TRYING TO OPEN YOUR EYES, MY MAN.

174
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,405
DON'T YOU SEE?

175
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,406
IF YOU LIVE WITH PHOEBE

176
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:47,907
SHE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THERE.

177
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,909
YOU'RE GOING TO GET HOME-- SHE'S THERE

178
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,910
YOU GO TO BED- - SHE'S THERE.

179
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,912
YOU WAKE UP, AND, OH, YES-- SHE'S THERE.

180
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,914
I KNOW. I CAN'T WAIT.

181
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:59,419
WERE YOUR PARENTS HAPPY OR SOMETHING?

182
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,920
LISTEN, CHANDLER, THE WAY I SEE IT IS

183
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,423
I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND SOMEONE THAT I REALLY LOVE.

184
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,426
I JUST... I WANT TO BE AROUND HER AS MUCH AS I CAN.

185
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,428
WOW, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU SAY IT

186
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,929
IT DOESN'T SOUND SO SCARY.

187
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,431
SEE, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, RIGHT?

188
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,932
YEAH, I THINK I DO.

189
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,434
YOU KNOW WHAT?

190
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,935
YOU MOVE IN WITH HER.

191
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,437
YOU MOVE IN WITH HER RIGHT NOW.

192
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,439
MAYBE I SHOULD MOVE IN WITH MONICA.

193
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,940
NO, IT'S TOO SOON FOR YOU GUYS.

194
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,944
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

195
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,449
NOW, WHEN THEY FOUND THE REMAINS

196
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,950
OF THE MESOZOIC MASTODON

197
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,453
THEY DISCOVERED WHAT APPEARED TO BE

198
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,457
THE REMAINS OF A PALEOZOIC AMPHIBIAN IN ITS JAWS.

199
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,460
HOW DID IT GET THERE?

200
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,964
MAYBE THIS SHOULD BE MORE OF A QUIET GAME.

201
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,467
HEY, GUYS.

202
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,968
HEY.

203
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,970
I LEFT MY WATCH ON THE COUNTER LAST NIGHT.

204
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,971
IT WAS RIGHT HERE. WHERE IS IT?

205
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,473
I DON'T KNOW.

206
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,974
ALL RIGHT, WELL, COME ON. I'M LATE FOR WORK.

207
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,976
HOW DO YOU KNOW? YOU DON'T HAVE A WATCH

208
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,481
GUYS, COULD YOU PLEASE JUST STOP THROWING THE BALL FOR ONE MINUTE

209
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:02,982
AND JUST HELP ME FIND IT?

210
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,983
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

211
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,485
YEAH, CAN'T DO IT.

212
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,986
NO! D...

213
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,987
AAH! AAH!

214
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,490
WHAT?

215
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,992
MONICA, WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT DROP THAT BALL.

216
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,494
YEAH. WE HAVEN'T DROPPED IT IN...

217
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,996
TWO HOURS, 27 MINUTES.

218
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,500
REALLY?

219
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,002
I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT IN TO WORK TODAY.

220
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,004
UM, I DON'T FEEL VERY GOOD.

221
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,507
YES!

222
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,009
WOW, UH, FOR A SECOND THERE

223
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,011
I THOUGHT I WAS FEELING BETTER, BUT I'M NOT.

224
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,013
BYE.

225
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,014
 HEY, RACH.

226
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,516
HEY.

227
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,517
CHECK IT OUT--

228
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,018
ALMOST THREE HOURS WITHOUT DROPPING IT.

229
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,019
WHOO.

230
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,021
OH, WOW. CONGRATULATIONS.

231
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,023
THAT'S QUITE A WASTE OF TIME.

232
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,526
RACH? YEAH?

233
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,528
YOU HAVE SCRATCHES ALL OVER. WHAT HAPPENED?

234
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,530
WELL, IT'S MY CAT.

235
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,030
WHAT?

236
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,532
OH, YEAH. I GOT A CAT.

237
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,533
I DON'T WANT A CAT.

238
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,034
OH, DON'T WORRY. IT'S NOT A CAT.

239
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,035
YEAH.

240
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,537
YOU GUYS

241
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,039
THIS CAT IS NOTHING LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER'S CAT.

242
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,542
I MEAN, IT'S NOT SWEET; IT'S NOT CUTE.

243
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,545
I EVEN DRAGGED THAT LITTLE STRING ON THE GROUND

244
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,548
AND IT J JUST FLIPPED OUT AND SCRATCHED THE HELL OUT OF ME...

245
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,051
AND I SWEAR-- I KNOW THIS SOUNDS CRAZY--

246
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,053
BUT EVERY TIME THIS CAT HISSES AT ME

247
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,555
I KNOW IT'S SAYING:

248
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,556
"RACHEL."

249
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,566
DOESN'T SOUND AS CRAZY AS PAYING 1,000 DOLLARS FOR A CAT.

250
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,568
WHA...! YOU PAID 1,000 DOLLARS FOR A CAT

251
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,069
WHEN YOU OWE ME 300 DOLLARS

252
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,072
WELL, I... I WAS GOING TO LET YOU PLAY WITH IT.

253
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,579
HEY.

254
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,580
MM... DID YOU TALK

255
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,582
TO GARY ABOUT THE MOVING IN THING?

256
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,584
YES, I DID, AND I THINK YOU SHOULD DO IT.

257
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,085
WHAT?

258
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,587
HE'S A GREAT GUY, YOU KNOW

259
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,088
AND HE LOVES YOU A LOT.

260
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,090
YOU ARE A VERY LUCKY LADY.

261
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,092
YOU ARE USELESS.

262
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,096
FREAKING OUT ABOUT COMMITMENT IS THE ONE THING YOU CAN DO--

263
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,599
THE ONE THING-- AND YOU CAN'T EVEN DO THAT RIGHT.

264
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,100
GOD. I'M SORRY.

265
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,102
IF HE ASKED ME, I'D MOVE IN WITH HIM.

266
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:03,603
OH!

267
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,105
GOD.

268
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,608
OOH, GET OUT OF HERE, YOU GOOD FOR NOTHING.

269
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,111
HEY, CHANDLER.

270
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,113
HEY, GAR.

271
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,116
HEY, SWEETIE.

272
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,618
HI. CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

273
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,121
YEAH... OKAY.

274
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,623
YOU LOOK VERY PRETTY TODAY.

275
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,124
THANKS. OKAY.

276
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,127
HERE'S THE THING-- YEAH?

277
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,130
I REALLY WANT THIS RELATIONSHIP TO MOVE FORWARD. MM HMM.

278
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,632
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT MOVING FORWARD

279
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,634
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE JUST MOVING BACKWARDS.

280
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,135
NOW, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

281
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,138
IF YOU'RE NOT MOVING FORWARD, YOU'RE JUST STAYING STILL

282
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,640
AND STAYING STILL IS GOOD.

283
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,642
WATCH THIS.

284
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,643
PHOEBE?

285
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,144
YEAH?

286
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,146
I WANT YOU TO MOVE IN WITH ME.

287
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,148
THAT IS SO SWEET

288
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,652
BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT IT'S A LITTLE TOO SOON?

289
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,653
THERE'S JUST SO MUCH

290
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,154
THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT EACH OTHER.

291
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,657
OH.

292
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:02,161
OH, OKAY, I GET IT.

293
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,163
I JUST... I DON'T WANT US TO JUMP INTO SOMETHING

294
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,665
YOU KNOW, THAT WE'RE NOT... READY FOR.

295
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,167
YOU KNOW? UH HUH.

296
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:12,171
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO MESS UP WHAT WE HAVE.

297
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,675
I'M JUST... I'M WORRIED IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG MISTAKE.

298
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,177
HUH.

299
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:22,181
WHICH IS WHY MY ANSWER IS YES!

300
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,183
REALLY?

301
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,184
UH HUH.

302
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,687
OH, YOU'RE SO HAPPY.

303
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,697
MONICA, STOP THROWING IT SO HARD!

304
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,200
WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM.

305
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,704
FOUR HOURS?

306
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,205
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR FOUR HOURS?

307
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,707
THAT'S RIGHT, BABY.

308
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,708
ALL RIGHT, I'M IN.

309
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,709
NO, NO! DON'T DO IT!

310
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,210
DON'T!

311
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,212
WHAT?

312
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,715
HE'S A DROPPER.

313
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,218
OH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT!

314
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,220
I'M NOT A DROPPER!

315
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,724
IT'S REALLY A A A... THREE PERSON GAME, YOU KNOW?

316
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,227
IT'S THROWING AND CATCHING.

317
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,229
ALL RIGHT.

318
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,234
OH, OH, IT'S SO HARD.

319
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,742

320
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,244
DON'T WORRY, GUYS. IT'S NOT A CAT.

321
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,749
OH, MY... OH, GOOD GOD.

322
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,250
I GIVE UP, YOU GUYS.

323
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,753
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO WITH THIS THING.

324
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,255
BAKING IT DIDN'T HELP, HUH?

325
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,758
SO WHY DON'T YOU

326
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,760
JUST TAKE IT BACK TO WHERE YOU GOT IT?

327
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,262
I TRIED. THEY WON'T TAKE HER BACK.

328
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:47,266
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE SHE'S A MINION OF THE ANTICHRIST.

329
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,769
RACH...

330
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,770
WHY WON'T THEY TAKE IT BACK?

331
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,271
WELL, THEY SAID THEY WOULD

332
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,773
BUT THEY WOULD ONLY GIVE ME STORE CREDIT

333
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,775
AND, I MEAN, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

334
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,776
GET A THOUSAND REGULAR CATS?

335
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,778
YOU SAID IT WAS A SHOW CAT.

336
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,779
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW IT?

337
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,280
WIN SOME PRIZE MONEY?

338
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,282
THOSE SHOWS COST, LIKE, 100 BUCKS TO ENTER

339
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,284
AND ALL YOU WIN ARE THESE RIBBONS

340
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,787
WHICH, TECHNICALLY, BELONG TO THE DAMN CAT.

341
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,288
LOOK, IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN KEEP IT AT OUR PLACE

342
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,790
UNTIL YOU FIND OUT WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

343
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,792
NO, MON, THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

344
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,294
I AM OUT 1,000 DOLLARS I AM ALL SCRATCHED UP

345
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,798
AND I'M STUCK WITH THIS STUPID CAT THAT LOOKS LIKE A HAND.

346
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,301

347
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,803
OH, MY GOD.

348
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,304
THE CAT'S MADE MY EYES WATER.

349
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,806
DON'T DON'T THROW IT TO ME!

350
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,809
MY VISION'S BEEN COMPROMISED!

351
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,312
OH, GOD. OKAY, OKAY...

352
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,314
IT'S OKAY.

353
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,816
MAN, THAT WAS CLOSE.

354
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,319
YEAH. YOU ALMOST OVERREACTED TO SOMETHING.

355
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,821
HEY. HEY.

356
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,822
HEY. HEY.

357
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,823
WE HAVE GREAT NEWS.

358
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,324
WE'RE MOVING IN TOGETHER!

359
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,826
ISN'T IT GREAT? YAY!

360
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,827
YAY!

361
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,328
CONGRATULATIONS. THAT'S GREAT.

362
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,830
I KNOW. I'M SO EXCITED.

363
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,331
SO AM I.

364
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,833
WELL, YOU'RE NOT MORE EXCITED THAN I AM.

365
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,334
NO WAY. I'M THE MOST EXCITED.

366
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,336
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU AT THE STATION LATER.

367
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,337
YEAH, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

368
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,339
DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE MOVING IN.

369
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,841
ALL RIGHT.

370
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,843
YOU'RE MOVING IN WITH HIM? WHAT HAPPENED?

371
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,845
I COULDN'T TELL HIM NO-- HE GOT SO SAD.

372
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,847
BUT MAYBE IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

373
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,348
I DO REALLY LIKE HIM A LOT

374
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,351
AND WOULD PROBABLY DO IT EVENTUALLY ANYWAY...

375
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,855
AND, PLUS, THINK OF ALL THE MONEY I'LL SAVE ON STAMPS.

376
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,357
WHY? DO YOU WRITE HIM A LOT?

377
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,860
NO. I JUST HEARD WHEN PEOPLE LIVE TOGETHER

378
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,362
THEY SPLIT THE COST OF STAMPS, DON'T THEY?

379
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,365
YEAH.

380
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,867
THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH, YEAH.

381
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,870
OH!

382
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,871
OH... I'M SORRY.

383
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,373
THE OVEN MITTS REALLY FREAKED ME OUT.

384
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,882
HI, HONEY. HEY, HONEY.

385
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,385
DID YOU FIND ANY APARTMENTS IN BROOKLYN HEIGHTS?

386
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,887
NO. NOTHING.

387
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,388
OH. REALLY? YEAH.

388
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,890
NOTHING AT ALL? NO.

389
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,392
AS SOON AS SOMETHING OPENS UP, WE'LL MOVE RIGHT IN.

390
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,394
UNLESS IT DOESN'T HAVE A POOL; I NEED A POOL.

391
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,398
PHOEBE, CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

392
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,400
UH HUH.

393
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,903
TAKE A SEAT.

394
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,905
ALL RIGHT.

395
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,406
YOU OKAY?

396
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,909
YOU FEEL ALL RIGHT?

397
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,411
YEAH, I FEEL GREAT, BECAUSE WE'RE MOVING IN TOGETHER.

398
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,413
SO YOU, UH...

399
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,415
YOU CHECKED THE PAPER FOR LISTINGS

400
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,417
IN BROOKLYN HEIGHTS, RIGHT?

401
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,420
YOU YOU CHECKED THE POST?

402
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,423
YEAH. UH HUH. THERE WAS NOTHING.

403
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,926
COULD I GET SOME WATER?

404
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,929
IN A MINUTE.

405
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,931
YOU YOU CHECKED TODAY'S POST?

406
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,432
UM, YEAH. TODAY'S. MM HMM.

407
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,934
HMM...

408
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,436
BECAUSE, UH, THIS IS TODAY'S POST

409
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,939
AND, UH, THESE ARE THE LISTINGS I FOUND.

410
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,941
"BROOKLYN HEIGHTS, TWO BEDROOMS."

411
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,943
"BROOKLYN HEIGHTS, ONE BEDROOM."

412
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,446
"BROOKLYN HEIGHTS," "BROOKLYN HEIGHTS," "BROOKLYN HEIGHTS."

413
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,948
OH, ARE THESE FOR RENT?

414
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,450
I THOUGHT PEOPLE WERE JUST BRAGGING.

415
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,454
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I THINK MIGHT BE GOING ON HERE.

416
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,956
NO, NO. DON'T LOOK AT THE TABLE.

417
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,456
LOOK AT ME.

418
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,458
OKAY?

419
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,461
I THINK SOMEBODY ASKED SOMEONE TO MOVE IN WITH HIM

420
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,462
AND I THINK SOMEONE SAID YES

421
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,464
BUT NOW SHE'S HAVING DOUBTS BECAUSE

422
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,466
MAYBE THINGS ARE MOVING TOO FAST FOR SOMEONE.

423
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,968
DOES THAT SOUND AT ALL

424
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,469
POSSIBLE TO YOU?

425
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,471
YES, YES, YES, FINE!

426
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,974
I AM SOMEONE!

427
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,976
YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT?

428
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:17,977
I HAVE DOUBTS.

429
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,480
I'M SORRY!

430
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,481
PHOEBE?

431
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:23,983
YEAH?

432
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,985
PHOEBE, IT'S OKAY THAT YOU FEEL THIS WAY.

433
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,486
I MEAN, IT IS SOON

434
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,989
AND THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT EACH OTHER.

435
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,992
I FIGURED EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT YOU, I REALLY LIKE;

436
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,494
AND THE THINGS I DON'T KNOW, I'D GET TO LEARN ABOUT

437
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,496
IN A PLACE WITH BOTH OUR NAMES ON THE MAILBOX.

438
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,999
THAT'S SO SWEET.

439
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,500
SWEETHEART

440
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,502
BUT NONE OF THAT MATTERS IF IT'S TOO SOON FOR YOU

441
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,005
IT'S FINE. WE DON'T HAVE TO MOVE IN TOGETHER.

442
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,007
I JUST... I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

443
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,009
LIVING WITH YOU WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY.

444
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,510
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT.

445
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,512
NO, I REALLY WANT TO LIVE WITH YOU.

446
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,513
I WANT TO MOVE IN WITH YOU.

447
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,015
ARE YOU SURE?

448
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,017
YES. DEFINITELY, YES.

449
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,519
LET'S LIVE IN AN APARTMENT THAT WE BOTH LIVE IN.

450
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,021
OH, THAT'S GREAT!

451
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,522
OH, WAIT. ONE SEC, ONE SEC.

452
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:08,027
HEY, YOU-- BEHIND THE GLASS-- WHO ARE YOU LOOKING AT?!

453
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,528
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SAY THAT

454
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,030
EVERY TIME I WAS IN ONE OF THESE ROOMS

455
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,531
WHICH WAS NEVER.

456
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,536
 SHOW CAT!

457
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:21,040
QUALITY SHOW CAT!

458
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,541
SHOW CAT!

459
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,542
OH, MY GOD!

460
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,045
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR BABY?

461
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,046
THAT'S NOT A BABY.

462
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,547
THAT'S A CAT.

463
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,049
EWW! IT'S CREEPY LOOKING.

464
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,550
OH, NO.

465
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,551
ACTUALLY, IT'S VERY SWEET.

466
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,053
IT'S VERY SWEET. LOOK.

467
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,054

468
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,058
YEAH. DO YOU WANT IT?

469
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,559

470
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,061
NO. I HATE CATS.

471
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,563
WELL, SO, THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME? OKAY?

472
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,066
JUST GET OUT OF HERE, ALL RIGHT? MOVE ON

473
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,068
SHEESH.

474
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,569
WOW, WHAT AN UNUSUAL CAT.

475
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,071
YES. THANK YOU. EXACTLY.

476
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,572
YOU WANT IT?

477
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,573
MAYBE.

478
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,575
I WAS THINKING ABOUT GETTING A CAT.

479
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,577
I WAS JUST GOING TO  GO TO THE SHELTER, BUT...

480
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,578
OKAY, WHY NOT?

481
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,080
OH, TERRIFIC.

482
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,081
THAT'LL BE 2,000 DOLLARS.

483
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,083
WHAT?

484
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,584
OKAY, 1,000 DOLLARS.

485
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,086
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED ME TO ADOPT YOUR CAT.

486
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,587
WELL, I DO

487
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,090
BUT YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT THIS

488
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,591
AS MORE OF AN INVESTMENT THAN A CAT.

489
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,593
OKAY, YEAH. I JUST WANTED A CAT.

490
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,095
YEAH. OKAY, OKAY...

491
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,596

492
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,099
OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW HOW TO HAGGLE

493
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,102
SO I'M NOT GOING TO TRY AND TAKE YOU ON, OKAY?

494
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,105
SO $800 AND I DON'T CALL THE COPS, WHICH I SHOULD

495
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,107
BECAUSE YOU ARE ROBBING ME BLIND! BLIND!

496
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,110
JUST TAKE THE CAT, LEAVE THE MONEY AND RUN AWAY.

497
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,111
JUST RUN AWAY.

498
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,612
DAMN IT!

499
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,615
CAN'T YOU AT LEAST SMILE OR SOMETHING?

500
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,117

501
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,120
OKAY, DID ANYBODY JUST HEAR THAT?

502
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,621
ANYBODY?

503
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,629
I'M STARVING.

504
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,631
COME ON, GUYS, SUCK IT UP.

505
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,633
WE'RE CLOSING IN ON TEN HOURS.

506
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,635
IT'S GUT CHECK TIME.

507
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,138
I DON'T KNOW WHO MADE YOU THE BOSS, ALL RIGHT?

508
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,139
WE INVENTED THIS GAME.

509
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,140
 PLEASE

510
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,642
I MADE THIS GAME WHAT IT IS.

511
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,644
NOT FUN ANYMORE?

512
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,647
I'M STILL HUNGRY.

513
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,648
ALL RIGHT, THERE'S SOME PIZZA AT MY PLACE.

514
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,150
WE CAN ALL EAT WITH ONE HAND, RIGHT?

515
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,151
ARE YOU WITH ME?

516
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,652
I AM.

517
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,654
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO! COME ON! COME ON!

518
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,156
LET'S GO, TEAM MONICA!

519
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,660
WE CAN WORK OUT THAT NAME LATER.

520
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,165
RACHEL...

521
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,167
WHAT IS YOUR CAT DOING IN ONE OF MY BOWLS?

522
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,169
IT'S NOT. I'M DEFROSTING A CHICKEN.

523
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,673
OH, I SOLD MRS. WHISKERSON.

524
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,175
OH, THANK GOD.

525
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,676
DID YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK?

526
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,178
YEAH. 1,500 DOLLARS.

527
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,180
YOU MADE A PROFIT?

528
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,185
I JUST CAME FOR THE RED VELVET PILLOW.

529
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,686
OH, YEAH.

530
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,688
THERE YOU GO.

531
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,690
THANKS, RACHEL, AND, UH, DON'T FORGET

532
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,692
YOU CAN COME VISIT HER ANYTIME YOU WANT.

533
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,194
OH, GOOD. GREAT.

534
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,695
I I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

535
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,200
HEY.

536
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,703
SO WHAT IS THIS, SOME KIND OF SNAKE OR SOMETHING?

537
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,712

538
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:17,216
I REALLY LIKE WAKING UP WITH YOU.

539
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,718
I LIKE WAKING UP WITH YOU, TOO.

540
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,720
OH, IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL MORNING.

541
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,723
I COULD STAY HERE ALL DAY

542
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,225
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

543
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,227
WE COULD HAVE BREAKFAST IN BED...

544
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,229
JUST A SECOND.

545
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,230
OKAY.

546
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,731
OH!

547
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,234
OH, NO.

548
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,738
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, MONICA!

549
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,739
LOOK ALIVE.

550
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,740
COME ON, LOOK ALIVE.

551
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,248
ROSS!

552
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,252
OH, I WAS HAVING THE BEST DREAM.

553
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,253
WHAT?

554
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,255
I DREAMED I WAS DROWNING

555
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,257
AND NOT THROWING THIS BALL.

556
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,761

WHATEVER THE PROBLEM IS, YOU CAN WORK IT OUT.

563
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,272

PHOEBE... PHOEBE'S NOT AN OFFICIAL BALLPLAYER.

577
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,800
