1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,004
HI.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,505
HI, YEAH, HI.

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,506
I'M, UM, PHOEBE BUFFAY

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,009
AND I HAVE BABIES COMING OUT OF ME.

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,511
OKAY. HAVE YOU STARTED HAVING CONTRACTIONS?

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,513
NOT YET. I HEARD THEY REALLY RT.

7
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,514
DO THEY HURT?

8
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,016
OH. WELL...

9
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,517
OH, MY GOD.

10
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:20,020
NOW, WHICH OF YOU IS THE FATHER?

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,521
NO, NONE OF THEM ARE THE FATHER.

12
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,523
THE FATHER IS MY BROTHER.

13
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,525
OKAY.

14
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,027
I AM SO GOING TO MISS

15
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,030
WATCHING YOU FREAK PEOPLE OUT LIKE THAT.

16
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,031

17
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,033
PHEEBS, THIS IS FOR THE BABIES TO LOOK AT SOMEDAY

18
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,035
SO IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY--

19
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,536
YOU KNOW, BEFORE IT ALL STARTS?

20
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,038
OH, OKAY.

21
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,039
UM... HI, KIDS.

22
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,041
UM, IT'S ME, AUNT PHOEBE.

23
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,543
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU.

24
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,045
PLEASE DON'T HURT ME.

25
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,549
HEY, WHAT TOOK YOU GUYS SO LONG?

26
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,051
YOUR CAB LEFT WHEN OURS DID.

27
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,554

28
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,057
WELL, WE HAD TO GO BACK BECAUSE I FORGOT MY JACKET.

29
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,558
THAT'S RIGHT.

30
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,564
YOU... YOU'RE NOT WEARING A JACKET.

31
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,068
OH, MAN. I DID IT AGAIN.

32
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,071
OKAY, SO SOMEONE HAS TO CALL FRANK AND ALICE

33
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,572
AND THEN MY MOM...

34
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,074
JOEY, WHAT A RE YOU DOING?

35
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,076
WELL, I GOT TO GET THE "BEFORE" SHOT.

49
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,128
HI. PHEEBS?

50
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,130
OKAY, SO WE JUST SPOKE TO THE NURSE

51
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,632
AND THE REASON THAT YOUR DOCTOR IS LATE

52
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,134
IS BECAUSE, UH, SHE'S NOT COMING.

53
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,637
WHAT?! APPARENTLY, SHE FELL IN THE SHOWER AND HIT HER HEAD.

54
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,139
OH, MY GOD.

55
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,141
SHE'S SO STUPID.

56
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,143
PHEEBS. PHEEBS, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

57
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,644
THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

58
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,147
I DON'T SEE THREE KIDS COMING OUT OF YOUR VAGINA.

59
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,151
HONEY, LISTEN, YOU KNOW WHAT?

60
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,152
THE NURSE SAID

61
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,154
THAT THE DOCTOR IS WONDERFUL.

62
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,156
YEAH, HE'S THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT.

63
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,157
ALL RIGHT.

64
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,658
OOH. OH, DEAR GOD, SAVE ME. WHAT?

65
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,660
I'M HAVING MY FIRST CONTRACTION.

66
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,663
OH, IT'S NOT BAD. OKAY.

67
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,166
AND SO THE MIRACLE

68
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,168
OF BIRTH BEGINS AND...

69
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,170

70
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,671
HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

71
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,673
OOH. SOMETHING HURTS.

72
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,675
OOH, IT'S SYMPATHY PAINS.

73
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,676
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.

74
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,679
I DIDN'T KNOW I CARED THAT MUCH.

75
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,182
HELLO.

76
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,683
HI. HI.

77
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,684
PHOEBE, I'M DR. HARAD.

78
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,685
I'M GOING TO BE

79
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,187
DELIVERING YOUR BABY.

80
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,189
I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN GOOD HANDS.

81
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,191
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME.

82
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,193
I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE TO DO YOUR INTERNAL.

83
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,194
IN THE MEANTIME, JUST RELAX

84
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,196
BECAUSE EVERYTHING HERE LOOKS GREAT.

85
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,198
AND, ALSO, I LOVE FONZIE.

86
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,204
DID HE JUST SAY HE LOVES FONZIE?

87
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,706
THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE.

88
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,208
ALL RIGHT.

89
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,211
HEY!

90
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,212

91
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,214
HEY, AM I LATE? AM I LATE?

92
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,715
NOBODY CAME OUT YET, RIGHT?

93
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,717
NO, NO, NO, WE HAVEN'T STARTED YET.

94
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,219
WHERE'S ALICE?

95
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,720
UH, DELAWARE. SHE'S ON HER WAY, THOUGH.

96
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,223
SO UNTIL SHE GETS HERE, I'M GOING TO BE YOUR COACH.

97
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,725
BUT DON'T WORRY-- SHE TOLD ME ABOUT THE "LA MAZDA" STUFF.

98
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,228
YEAH, THAT'S WHEN, IF YOU GET THE BABIES

99
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,729
OUT BY THE END OF THE MONTH

100
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,731
THEY GIVE YOU TWO PERCENT FINANCING.

101
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,233
YEAH.

102
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,239
MONICA, YOU'RE GOING TO BE VERY PROUD OF ME.

103
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,243
I JUST GOT US DATES WITH TWO UNBELIEVABLY CUTE NURSES.

104
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,744
OH, MY.

105
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,747
THEY ARE MALE NURSES.

106
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,250
NOT IN MY HEAD.

107
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,752
ANYWAY, THEY WANT TO TAKE US OUT SATURDAY NIGHT.

108
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,254
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

109
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,755
UM...

110
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,257
UM...

111
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,262
I DON'T THINK SO.

112
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,763
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

113
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,265
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S BEEN TELLING ME

114
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,766
TO GET OVER ROSS AND MOVE ON.

115
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,768
I'M MOVING ON, AND YOU'RE MOVING ON WITH ME.

116
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,771
COME ON. GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO GO.

117
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,273
WELL, UM...

118
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,277
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A GOOD REASON

119
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,779
AND THEN I'LL TELL YOU IF IT'S TRUE?

120
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,281
WHAT?

121
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,284
HARDER THAN IT SOUNDS, ISN'T IT?

122
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,785
OKAY, YOU'RE COMING WITH ME

123
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,287
AND I ALSO TOLD THEM IF WE'RE STILL HERE WHEN THEY GET OFF

124
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,789
WE'LL GO DOWN TO THE CAFETERIA AND GET SOME JELL O WITH THEM.

125
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,291
YEP.

126
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,294
THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR JELL O.

127
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,798
JOEY, HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT DIRTY?

128
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,799
AH, IT'S EASY.

129
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,301
YEAH, I CAN DO  IT WITH ANYTHING.

130
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,802
WATCH. UH...

131
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,306
GRANDMA'S CHICKEN SALAD...

132
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,314
ROSS! COME HERE.

133
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,317
GET A SHOT OF THIS.

134
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,318
HEY, BABIES--

135
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,821
THESE ARE THE HEADLINES ON THE DAY YOU WERE BORN.

136
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,823
OKAY, NOW, GIRL BABY, TURN AWAY

137
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,326
AND, BOY BABIES... CHECK IT OUT, HUH?

138
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,328
THIS IS WHAT NAKED WOMEN LOOKED LIKE

139
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,829
THE MONTH YOU WERE BORN.

140
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,333
ALL RIGHT, NOW LET'S DIVE RIGHT INTO THE GOOD STUFF.

141
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,336
OKAY, I'M HAVING ANOTHER ONE.

142
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,837
THIS ONE DOESN'T HURT EITHER.

143
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,339
OOH, YES, IT DOES. OW! OW!

144
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,841
OW! OW!

145
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,343
OOH!

146
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,344
NOTHING.

147
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,347
OOH, I WAS KIND OF HOPING THAT WAS IT.

148
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,851
HEY, WHERE ARE MONICA AND RACHEL ANYWAY?

149
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,854
A COUPLE OF NURSES ASKED THEM OUT; MAYBE THEY'RE WITH THEM.

150
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,856
REALLY? MALE NURSES?

151
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,359
YEAH. I WAS BUMMED, TOO.

152
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,362
SO THEY'RE GOING ON DATES?

153
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,363
WHEN?

154
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,864
I THINK SATURDAY.

155
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:05,865

156
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,367
WHAT'S WITH HIM?

157
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,369
UM, SYMPATHY PAINS.

158
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,371
I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY SWEET AT FIRST

159
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,874
BUT NOW I THINK HE'S JUST TRYING TO STEAL MY THUNDER.

160
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,876
OKAY.

161
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,877
OKAY.

162
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,878
LET'S SEE WHAT

163
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,879
WE GOT HERE.

164
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,382
OH, YOU KNOW, FONZIE DATED TRIPLETS.

165
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,884
YOU KNOW, THIS FONZIE PERSON

166
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,386
YOU KEEP REFERRING TO-

167
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,389
IS THAT, UH... IS THAT ANOTHER DOCTOR?

168
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,890
OH, NO, NO.

169
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,394
FONZIE IS THE NICKNAME OF ARTHUR FONZARELLI.

170
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,895
THE FONZ.

171
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,899
ALL RIGHT.

172
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,406
IT'S NOT THAT WEIRD, IS IT?

173
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,907
IT'S VERY WEIRD.

174
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,910
I DON'T WANT SOME GUY DOWN THERE TELLING ME I'M

175
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,912
YOU KNOW, "DILATED AMUNDO."

176
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,418
TO BE FAIR HE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE IMPERSONATING FONZIE...

177
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,419
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

178
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,422
WHY ARE YOU DEFENDING HIM?

179
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,923
JUST GET ME ANOTHER DOCTOR--

180
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,426
ONE WHO IS NOT CRAZY AND DOES NOT "FONZIE."

181
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,428
AGAIN, IT'S NOT THAT HE...

182
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,429
OH! OH!

183
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,436
OH, HEY, THERE THERE YOU ARE.

184
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,938
LISTEN, I I THINK THAT THERE IS SOMETHING

185
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,939
THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

186
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,442
OH, IS THIS ABOUT YOU... YOU DATING THE NURSE?

187
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,944
YEAH. JOEY ALREADY TOLD ME, AND I AMSO,SO FINE.

188
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,945
I MEAN, YOU AND I--

189
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,947
WE'RE JUST, YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOTHING.

190
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,949
WE'RE JUST... EH, GOOFING AROUND.

191
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,453
UM, ACTUALLY I WAS ABOUT TO TELL YOU

192
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,955
THAT I WAS I WAS GOING TO GET OUT OF IT

193
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,458
BUT, HEY, IF WE'RE JUST GOOFING AROUND

194
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,460
THEN, UH, MAYBE I WILL GO OUT WITH HIM.

195
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,962
FINE. MAYBE I WILL, TOO.

196
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:45,965
HEY. YOU GUYS.

197
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,468
LOOK WHAT I FOUND IN THE... GIIIFT SHOP!

198
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,469
OH! OW!

199
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,971
GET UP! GET UP!

200
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,477
OKAY, PHEEBS? YEAH.

201
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,479
THIS IS DR. OBERMAN.

202
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,483
HE HAS NO STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT FONZIE

203
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,986
 OR ANY OF THE HAPPY DAYS GANG.

204
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,489
HI. AND YOU'RE GOING INTO WHAT GRADE?

205
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,990
I'M ACTUALLY A FIRST YEAR RESIDENT

206
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,492
BUT I GET THAT A LOT.

207
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,993
YOU SEE, I GRADUATED EARLY...

208
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,495
UH HUH, ME, TOO.

209
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,497
ROSS, MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE SPECIFIED

210
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,500
THAT I'D BE NEEDING A GROWN UP DOCTOR.

211
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,502
OH, NO, REALLY, I'M FULLY QUALIFIED TO...

212
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,003
SHH! DOOGIE, SHH!

213
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,508
DOESN'T ANYBODY UNDERSTAND THAT I'M

214
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,510
GOING TO BE HAVING BABIES SOON? HUH?!

215
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,511
GO!

216
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,513
GO, LITTLE BOY, GO!

217
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,519
OH, YOU MADE HIM CRY.

218
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,025
MR. TRIBBIANI, I'M AFRAID

219
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,028
YOU'VE GOT KIDNEY STONES.

220
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,531
UH... WELL, WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?

221
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,033
IT'S KIDNEY STONES.

222
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,535
OR...

223
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,537
KIDNEY STONES.

224
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,040
WELL, IF IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE...

225
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,543
THEN THAT WOULD  BE KIDNEY STONES.

226
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,047
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE GETTING THERE.

227
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,549
OH, AND, YOU KNOW

228
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,551
THESE BABIES ARE VERY, VERY LUCKY.

229
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,052
THEY ARE? WHY?

230
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,554
THEY HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING BORN

231
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,556
ON THE FONZ'S HALF BIRTHDAY.

232
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,560
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

233
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,062
JUST TO CLARIFY...

234
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,064
I'M NOT FONZIE.

235
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,074
HONEY, YOU KNOW, I JUST GOT TO TELL YOU.

236
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,576
I THINK THIS IS SUCH A TERRIFIC THING

237
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,078
THAT YOU'RE HAVING THESE BABIES FOR FRANK AND ALICE.

238
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,079
I KNOW IT IS.

239
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,582
CAN I TELL YOU A LITTLE SECRET?

240
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,583
YEAH, WHAT?

241
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,085
I WANT TO KEEP ONE.

242
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,592
OH, I'M GOING TO BE ON THE NEWS.

243
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,094
OKAY, PHOEBE

244
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,596
HONEY, YOU'VE  GOT TO BE KIDDING.

245
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,598
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T KEEP ONE OF THESE BABIES.

246
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,100
WHY NOT? MAYBE I CAN; YOU DON'T KNOW.

247
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,603
YES, YES, I DO KNOW-- FRANK AND ALICE ARE GOING

248
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,104
TO WANT TO KEEP ALL OF THEIR CHILDREN.

249
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,606
MAYBE NOT, YOU KNOW?

250
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,608
SERIOUSLY-- THREE BABIES ARE A HANDFUL.

251
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,611
MAYBE THEY'RE, YOU KNOW, LOOKING FOR A CHANCE

252
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,612
TO UNLOAD ONE OF THEM.

253
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,114
LISTEN, I'D HATE TO MISS AN OPPORTUNITY

254
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,618
JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T ASK.

255
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,622
PHOEBE, NO. THIS IS. .. THIS IS INSANE.

256
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,123
OH, JUST ASK HIM.

257
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,125
WHA...? ME?

258
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,627
I CAN'T ASK HIM.

259
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,129
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW INAPPROPRIATE THAT WOULD BE?

260
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,631
ALL I'M SAYING IS

261
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,634
JUST TALK TO FRANK, OKAY?

262
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,636
JUST... YOU KN OW, FEEL HIM OUT.

263
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,638
NO. FORGET IT. I AM NOT GOING TO ASK FRANK

264
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,139
TO GIVE YOU ONE OF HIS KIDS.

265
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,142
YOU'RE RIGHT.

266
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,144
OH.

267
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,648

268
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,650
TELL HIM IT'S FOR YOU.

269
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,654
FEELING A LITTLE BETTER, SWEETIE?

270
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,155
WELL, MAYBE A LITTLE.

271
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,658
I WISH YOU HADN'T SEEN ME THROW UP.

272
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,160
ME, TOO.

273
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,164
HEY. I JUST HEARD.

274
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,165
WHAT'S UP?

275
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,167
KIDNEY STONES.

276
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,671
NOW, ORDINARILY, MR. TRIBBIANI

277
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,174
WE TRY TO BREAK THE STONES UP WITH SHOCK WAVES

278
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,177
BUT THEY'RE TOO CLOSE TO THE BLADDER NOW

279
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,680
WHICH MEANS WE CAN EITHER WAIT FOR YOU TO PASS THEM

280
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,181
OR ELSE GO UP THE URETHRA.

281
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,184
WHOA HO!

282
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,686
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

283
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,688
NOTHING IS GOING UP,OKAY?

284
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,691
"UP"-- "UP"  IS NOT AN OPTION.

285
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,692
WHAT'S A URETHRA?

286
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,195

287
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,697
ARE YOU CRAZY?!

288
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,701
SO DID YOU ASK HIM?

289
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,204
NO. I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO BE ALONE WITH HIM YET.

290
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,206
WELL, I'M KIND OF ON A CLOCK HERE.

291
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,709

292
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,711
OH, FONZIE.

00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,722
