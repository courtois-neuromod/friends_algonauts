1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,007
.
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,010
NONE OF THAT, NOT WHILE YOU'RE LIVING UNDER MY ROOF.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,511
WHAT?

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,014
LOOK, JUST BECAUSE I KNOW ABOUT YOU TWO

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,016
DOESN'T MEAN I LIKE LOOKING AT IT.

6
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,019
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE AT AN AUDITION FOR ANOTHER HOUR?

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,022
WELL, I'M SORRY IF I'M NOT A MIDDLE AGED BLACK WOMAN.

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,525
AND I'M ALSO SORRY

9
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,028
IF SOMETIMES I GO TO THE WRONG AUDITION.

10
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,030
OKAY, LOOK, IF I HAVE TO PRETEND

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,531
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU TWO

12
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,533
THEN YOU TWO ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PRETEND

13
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,035
THERE'S NOTHING TO KNOW ABOUT.

14
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,037
OKAY. SORRY. OKAY.

15
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,538
SORRY.

16
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,044

17
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,046
I CAN HEAR THAT!

18
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,548
RACHEL'S AT WORK.

19
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,557
I CAN STILL HEAR YOU!

33
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,107
HEY.

34
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,108
HELLO. HEY.

35
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,610
HEY. WHAT'S THAT?

36
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,112
YEAH, MY MOM SENT ME A FAMILY HEIRLOOM

37
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,613
THAT ONCE BELONGED TO MY GRANDMOTHER.

38
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,115
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

39
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,616
A YEAR AGO, I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A FAMILY

40
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,618
AND NOW I HAVE HEIRLOOMS, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

41
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,123
ONLY HEIRLOOM I EVER GOT WAS A FEATHER BOA.

42
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,625
GOT IT FROM MY DAD; HE GOT IT FROM HIS DAD.

43
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,129
HOW DID I EVER GET BORN?

44
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,634

45
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,137
HEE HEE.

46
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,140
OH! GOD!

47
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,141
AH!

48
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,145
OOH, SOFT.

49
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,146
IS THIS MINK?

50
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,647
YEAH.

51
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,150
WHY WOULD MY MOTHER SEND ME A FUR?

52
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,153
DOESN'T SHE KNOW ME, BUT AT ALL?!

53
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,155
PLUS, I HAVE A PERFECTLY FINE COAT

54
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,657
THAT NO INNOCENT ANIMAL SUFFERED TO MAKE.

55
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,659
YEAH, JUST SOME NINE YEAR OLD FILIPINO KIDS

56
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,662
WHO WORKED THEIR FINGERS BLOODY FOR 12 CENTS AN HOUR.

57
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,665
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

58
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,167
I MADE THAT UP.

59
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,670
HEY.

60
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,671
ROSS.

61
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,173
ROSS...

62
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,674
YOU CAN'T PUT UP FLIERS IN HERE.

63
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,676
HOW COME? EVERYBODY ELSE DOES.

64
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,678
YOU CAN'T.

65
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,683
WHAT IS THAT?

66
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,185
OH, UH...

67
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,687
I'M JUST GETTING RID OF A COUPLE OF THINGS.

68
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,689
THIS IS ALL OF YOUR THINGS.

69
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,692
YES. YES, IT IS.

70
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,194
NO, BUT IT'S GOOD.

71
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,696
SEE, EMILY THINKS WE SHOULD GET ALL NEW STUFF.

72
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,698
STUFF THAT'S JUST OURS, TOGETHER.

73
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,200
YOU KNOW, BRAND NEW.

74
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,701
SO, BASICALLY, THIS IS

75
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,203
A GETTING RID OF ANYTHING- RACHEL EVER TOUCHED SALE.

76
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,206
TOUCHED, USED, SAT ON, SLEPT ON...

77
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,708
I'LL TAKE IT ALL.

78
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,211
HEY, ROSS, YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT?

79
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,713
LOOK, IF I CAN JUST DO WHAT EMILY WANTS

80
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,714
AND GET HER TO NEW YORK

81
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,716
I'M SURE EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

82
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,718
OKAY, BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S A LITTLE EXTREME?

83
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,720
AFTER WHAT I DID, CAN YOU BLAME HER?

84
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,222
OH, MY GOD, YOU GOT OFF EASY.

85
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,224
WHEN MY FRIEND, SILVIE'S HUSBAND

86
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,226
SAID SOMEONE ELSE'S NAME IN BED

87
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,728
SHE CURSED HIM AND TURNED HIS THINGIE GREEN.

88
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,733
I GUESS I'M LUCKY EMILY'S NOT MAGIC.

89
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,237
OH, SHE IS.

90
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,239
WE ALL ARE.

91
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,248
WHAT IS HE DOING?

92
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:13,253
EMILY THINKS ROSS'S FURNITURE'S GOT "RACHEL COOTIES"?

93
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,754
ALL RIGHT, CALM DOWN, JOEY.

94
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,757
NO. EVERYTHING'S GETTING ALL MESSED UP, YOU KNOW?

95
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,759
EMILY WON'T LET ROSS SEE RACHEL.

96
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,761
WE'RE NOT GOING TO STOP SEEING RACHEL.

97
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,763
HENCE, ROSS STOPS SEEING US.

98
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,265
OH, I HATE THIS.

99
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,266
EVERYTHING'S CHANGING.

100
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,268
YEAH, I KNOW, WE'RE LOSING ROSS.

101
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,269
JOEY SAID "HENCE."

102
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,275
LOOK, I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS, EITHER

103
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,277
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF ROSS SAYS HE'S HAPPY

104
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,280
THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE TO KEEP OUR FEELINGS

105
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,281
ABOUT EMILY TO OURSELVES.

106
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,782
ARE YOU COOL WITH THAT?

107
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,284
NO.

108
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,288
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M AN ACTOR.

109
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,290
I'LL ACT COOL.

110
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,794
PROBABLY BE SOME OF THE HARDEST ACTING I'VE EVER DONE.

111
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,796
MAYBE I'LL PLAY IT WITH MUSTACHE.

112
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,304
OOH...

113
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,807
OH, GOD! STORAGE ROOMS GIVE ME THE CREEPS.

114
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,809
MONICA, COME ON, PLEASE, HURRY UP.

115
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,811
HONEY, PLEASE.

116
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,313
RACHEL, IF YOU WANT THE LITTLE, ROUND WAFFLES

117
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,315
YOU'VE GOT TO WAIT TILL I FIND THE LITTLE

118
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,316
ROUND WAFFLE IRON.

119
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,817
I WANT THE LITTLE, ROUND WAFFLES.

120
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,319
ALL RIGHT.

121
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,320
OH, HERE IT IS.

122
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,821
RIGHT UNDERNEATH A CAN OF BUG BOMB.

123
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,825
I WONDER IF THE BEST PLACE TO PUT SOMETHING THAT COOKS FOOD

124
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,827
IS UNDERNEATH THE CAN OF POISON?

125
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,831
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL HAVE TOAST.

126
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,833

127
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,335
OH, MY GOD!

128
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,336
AH!

129
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,837
FOG HIM! FOG HIM!

130
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,838

131
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,340
FOG HIM!

132
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,342

133
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,347
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS COAT.

134
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,348
I'LL TAKE IT.

135
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,350
THAT MIGHT WORK.

136
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,352
OOH, YEAH.

137
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,858
HUH? ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

138
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,860
YOU'RE ON IN FIVE, MS. MINELLI.

139
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,866
NO, NO, NO. IT'S JUST A BIT SUDDEN.

140
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,368
NO, IT'S GREAT, OKAY?

141
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,869
I AM TOTALLY ON BOARD.

142
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,371
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

143
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,372
ALL RIGHT, BYE.

144
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,876
WHAT'S THE MATTER, ROSS?

145
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,380
NOTHING. NO, NO, UH, ACTUALLY... GREAT NEWS.

146
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,383
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH EMILY

147
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,886
AND LOOKS LIKE I'M MOVING TO A NEW APARTMENT.

148
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,388
WHOO HOO!

149
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,890
WHY?

150
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,892
WELL, HER THOUGHT IS, AND I AGREE

151
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,396
FRESH, NEW FURNITURE, WHY NOT A FRESH, NEW APARTMENT?

152
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,898
HER COUSIN HAS THIS GREAT PLACE TO SUBLET.

153
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,401
IT'S GOT A VIEW OF THE RIVER ON ONE SIDE

154
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,403
AND COLUMBIA ON THE OTHER.

155
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,404
THAT'S WAY UPTOWN.

156
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,906
THAT'S LIKE THREE TRAINS AWAY...

157
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:47,907
WHICH IS GREAT.

158
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,909
I LOVE TO RIDE THAT RAIL.

159
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,413
SO YOU'RE REALLY OKAY WITH THIS?

160
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,915
YES. YES. I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF FAR FROM WORK

161
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,418
BUT, UH, YOU KNOW, I'LL GET SO MUCH DONE

162
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,919
ON THE COMMUTE.

163
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,423
I'VE BEEN GIVEN THE GIFT OF TIME.

164
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,924
YOU KNOW, THAT'S SO FUNNY

165
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,427
BECAUSE LAST CHRISTMAS, I GOT THE GIFT OF SPACE.

166
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:11,931
WE SHOULD GET THEM TOGETHER AND MAKE A CONTINUUM.

167
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,437
NOW HE'S MOVING?

168
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,439
MAN, WHAT IS EMILY DOING TO HIM?

169
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,940
OW!

170
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,443
HE'S NOT EVEN HERE!

171
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,446
YOU GUYS! YOU GUYS!

172
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,448
WE WERE JUST IN THE STORAGE AREA

173
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,450
AND WE SAW THIS REALLY CREEPY MAN.

174
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,453
IT WAS LIKE THIS CRAZY EYED, HAIRY BEAST MAN.

175
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,955
HE WAS LIKE A... LIKE A BIGFOOT

176
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,457
OR A YETI OR SOMETHING.

177
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,458
AND HE CAME AT  US

178
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,959
WITH AN AX, SO RACHEL

179
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,461
HAD TO USE A BUG BOMB ON HIM.

180
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:42,962
YEAH, I PULLED THE TAB

181
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,964
AND I JUST FOGGED HIS YETI ASS.

182
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:49,469
UH, LIKE DARK HAIR, BUSHY BEARD?

183
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,470
YEAH.

184
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,971
YEAH, YOU FOGGED DANNY.

185
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,473
OH, PLEASE.

186
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,476
WE DID NOT FOG DANNY.

187
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,478
WHO'S DANNY?

188
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,979
DANNY JUST MOVED IN DOWNSTAIRS.

189
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,481
YEAH, HE JUST GOT BACK

190
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,983
FROM THIS FOUR MONTH TREK IN THE ANDES.

191
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,485
NICE FELLA.

192
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,986
OH, HE'S NICE. HE'S NICE.

193
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,988
YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS...

194
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,990
STICK UP FOR THE PEOPLE WE FOG.

195
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,002
YEAH. HI.

196
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,504
YOU MIGHT NOT REMEMBER US

197
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,506
BUT WE ARE THE GIRLS THAT FOGGED YOU.

198
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,507
YEAH. WE'RE... WE'RE

199
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,509
REALLY SORRY WE FOGGED YOU.

200
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,510
YEAH.

201
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,011
OKAY.

202
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,515
HMM.

203
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,018
HI.

204
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,019
UH, JUST SO YOU KNOW

205
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,021
WE... WE DIDN'T MEAN TO FOG YOU.

206
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,024
WE ACTUALLY THOUGHT YOU WERE, LIKE, A YETI OR SOMETHING.

207
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,527
OKAY.

208
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,032
YES?

209
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,033
HI. UH, SORRY TO BOTHER YOU

210
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,035
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN ACCEPT

211
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,037
YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF OUR APOLOGY.

212
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,540
IT JUST DOESN'T REALLY SEEM LIKE YOU MEAN IT.

213
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,541
YEAH.

214
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,043
OKAY.

215
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,049
WOW. THAT  GUY IS SO RUDE.

216
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,051
REALLY. WHAT IS WITH THAT GUY?

217
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,054
I MEAN, YOU'D FORGIVE ME IF I FOGGED YOU.

218
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,056
WELL, YOU  DID A LITTLE BIT.

219
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,558
OH, MY GOD.

220
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,560
HONEY, I'M SO SORRY.

221
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,061
I TOTALLY FORGIVE YOU.

222
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,062
REALLY? YEAH.

223
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,064
OH...

224
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,068
HEY. HEY.

225
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,571
SO, LISTEN, YOU KNOW MY FRIEND CHRIS

226
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,573
WHO OWNS THE CREMATORIUM?

227
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,074
CREMATORIUM CHRIS?

228
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,075
SURE.

229
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,577
WELL, HE SAID THAT HE

230
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,079
WOULD CREMATE  MY FUR COAT FOR FREE

231
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,081
IF I, UM, YOU KNOW, BRINGING

232
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,083
THE NEXT PERSON I KNOW WHO DIES.

233
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,586
REALLY?

234
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,587

235
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,588
OH, MY GOD.

236
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,591
OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT THESE PELTS.

237
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,092
DON'T GET TOO ATTACHED.

238
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,594
SHE'S HAVING IT CREMATED.

239
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:55,595
WHAT?

240
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,598
PH PHOEBE? HONEY?

241
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,099
HONEY, I KNOW YOU'RE QUIRKY

242
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,602
AND I GET A BIG KICK OUT OF IT.

243
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,103
WE ALL DO, ACTUALLY.

244
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,606
BUT IF YOU DESTROY A COAT LIKE THIS--

245
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,109
I MEAN, THAT IS LIKE A CRIME AGAINST NATURE.

246
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,111
NO, NOT NATURE. FASHION.

247
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,613
THIS IS FASHION?

248
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,616
OKAY, SO TO YOU, DEATH IS FASHION.

249
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,617
THAT'S REALLY FUNNY.

250
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,619
YEAH. HERE'S... HERE'S PHOEBE

251
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,623
UH, SPORTING, YOU KNOW, A CUTTING EDGE, HAIRY CARCASS

252
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,627
FROM, YOU KNOW, THE STEEL TRAPS OF WINTRY RUSSIA.

253
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,128
I MEAN, YOU REALLY THINK

254
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,631
THIS LOOKS GOOD?

255
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,133
BECAUSE I DO.

256
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,639
YEAH. UH HUH.

257
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,641
I KNOW. I MISS YOU, TOO.

258
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,142
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU.

259
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,644
I LOVE YOU. BYE.

260
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,146
OKAY, WHAT IS IN HERE, ROCKS?

261
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,650
OH, NO. THIS IS MY COLLECTION OF, UH, FOSSIL SAMPLES.

262
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,652
SO ROCKS.

263
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,163
I'M REALLY GOING TO MISS THIS APARTMENT.

264
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,165
YOU KNOW, BEN... BEN TOOK HIS FIRST STEPS

265
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,667
RIGHT OVER THERE.

266
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,168
HMM.

267
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,170
HEY, REMEMBER WHEN I RAN INTO THIS THING

268
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,172
AND IT KIND OF KNOCKED ME OUT

269
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,173
A LITTLE, HUH?

270
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,675
I LOVE THIS PLACE.

271
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,678
TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO MOVE.

272
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,180
UH, ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU'RE

273
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,183
NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY ABOUT THIS?

274
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,685
WELL, I ME AN, IF, UH...

275
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,687
IF EMILY GAVE ME A CHOICE...

276
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,689
YOU DO HAVE A CHOICE.

277
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,191
ROSS, WHY ARE YOU LISTENING TO HER?

278
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,693
ARE YOU CRAZY?

279
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,194
WHAT?

280
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,697
WELL, IT'S NOT RIGHT, WHAT EMILY WANTS YOU TO DO.

281
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,198
SHE IS TOTALLY... OW!

282
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,199
STOP PINCHING ME.

283
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,701
LOOK, NOW, YOU GUYS SAID

284
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,203
I ONLY HAVE TO KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT

285
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,205
AS LONG AS ROSS WAS HAPPY, RIGHT?

286
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,207
WELL, HE JUST TOLD ME

287
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,209
THAT HE'S NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY.

288
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,713
WHAT'S GOING ON?

289
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,715
WE ALL HATE EMILY.

290
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,218
NO.

291
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,220
NO. ROSS, WE DO NOT HATE EMILY.

292
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,722
WE JUST... WE JUST THINK

293
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,724
THAT YOU'RE HAVING TO SACRIFICE

294
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,726
A WHOLE LOT TO MAKE HER HAPPY.

295
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,728
YEAH.

296
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,229
WE JUST THINK THAT MAYBE SHE'S BEING

297
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,232
A LITTLE... UNREASONABLE.

298
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,734
YES. YES. UNREASONABLE.

299
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,236
UNREASONABLE?

300
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,238
HOW ABOUT WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION

301
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,240
WHEN ONE OF YOU GUYS GETS MARRIED?

302
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,742
YOU HAVE NO IDEA

303
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,244
WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE A MARRIAGE WORK.

304
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,245
IT'S ABOUT COMPROMISE.

305
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,247
DO YOU ALWAYS LIKE IT? NO.

306
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,248
DO YOU DO IT? YES.

307
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,251
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALL LAUGHING, HAPPY, CANDY IN THE SKY

308
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,754
DRINKING COFFEE AT CENTRAL PERK ALL THE TIME.

309
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,756
IT'S REAL LIFE, OKAY?

310
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,759
IT'S WHAT GROWN UP SDO.

311
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,266
I THINK HE'S RIGHT.

312
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,770
YOU GUYS HANG OUT AT THE COFFEEHOUSE WAY TOO MUCH.

313
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,278
GOD, I FEEL SO GUILTY ABOUT ROSS.

314
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,780
OH, I KNOW.

315
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,282
I KIND OF FEEL LIKE IT'S MY FAULT.

316
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,285
KIND OF?

317
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,788
IF YOU HAD JUST KEPT THIS TO YOURSELF

318
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,790
NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

319
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,292
WELL, I'M KEEPING SO MANY THINGS TO MYSELF THESE DAYS

320
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,294
SOMETHING WAS BOUND TO SLIP OUT.

321
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,798
WELL, I THINK IT'S VERY BRAVE WHAT YOU SAID.

322
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,299
OH, YEAH.

323
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,802
ALL RIGHT. I CAN'T SIT HERE ANYMORE.

324
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,805
I HAVE TO WALK PLACES.

325
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,807
PHEEBS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THE COAT?

326
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,808
HOW ABOUT THE WHOLE

327
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,309
ANIMAL RIGHTS THING?

328
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,312
WELL, I'VE BEEN READING UP, AND FOR YOUR INFORMATION

329
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,814
MINKS ARE NOT VERY NICE.

330
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,317
SO THEY DESERVE TO BE KILLED?

331
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:42,321
WELL, THEY ARE REAL... BAD.

332
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,325
OKAY, I ADMIT IT, I LOVE THIS COAT, OKAY.

333
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,328
IT'S THE BEST THING I'VE EVER HAD WRAPPED AROUND ME

334
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,330
INCLUDING PHIL HUNTLEY.

335
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,833
REMEMBER PHIL HUNTLEY?

336
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,334
HE WAS FINE.

337
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,846
HI.

338
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,851
SO, YOU LIKE THE SHORT HAIR BETTER?

339
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:12,852
WHAT?

340
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,857
YETI... DANNY?!

341
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:23,362
HAD TO CUT MY HAIR TO GET RID OF THE, UH... FOGGER SMELL.

342
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,864
OH.

343
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,866
LISTEN, OH, I'M SO SORRY.

344
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,868
I WOULD I WOULD HAVE NEVER FOGGED YOU

345
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,371
YOU KNOW, IF YOU HADN'T LOOKED SO, YOU KNOW, UH...

346
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,873
ABSOLUTELY.

347
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,375
SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST INTO APPEARANCES.

348
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,877
WHAT?

349
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,879
THAT'S COOL. THAT'S COOL.

350
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,880
WHOA! WHOA! NO!

351
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,881
NO, THAT IS NOT COOL.

352
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,883
YOU YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.

353
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,885
COME ON. YOU'VE GOT THE SHOPPING BAGS

354
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,886
AND THE SAKS CATALOGUE.

355
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,888
SO, UH, FROM THAT, YOU THINK

356
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,890
YOU'VE GOT ME ALL FIGURED OUT?!

357
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,391
WELL, YOU DON'T.

358
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:57,897
YOU KNOW, I COULD HAVE TOYS FOR UNDERPRIVILEGED KIDS IN HERE.

359
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,398
DO YOU?

360
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:03,402
WELL, YOU KNOW, IF KIDS LIKE TO PLAY WITH CAPRI PANTS.

361
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,905
OKAY.

362
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,907
AND STOP SAYING THAT.

363
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,408
I HATE THAT.

364
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,409
OKAY.

365
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,421
FINE.

366
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,422
I JUDGED YOU.

367
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,424
I MADE A SNAP JUDGMENT, BUT YOU DID IT, TOO

368
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,928
AND YOU'RE WORSE, BECAUSE YOU ARE STICKING TO YO UR STUPID SNAP JUDGMENT.

369
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,430
YOU CAN'T EVEN OPEN UP YOUR MIND FOR A SECOND

370
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,932
TO SEE THAT YOU MIGHT BE WRONG

371
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,433
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT YOU?

372
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,936
THAT PIZZA PLACE ACROSS THE STREET ANY GOOD?

373
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,938
WHAT?

374
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,439
I'M HUNGRY. WANT TO GET SOME PIZZA?

375
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,942
YOU CAN KEEP YELLING IF THERE'S MORE.

376
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,944
OKAY.

377
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,445
OKAY.

378
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,446
STOP SAYING THAT.

379
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,948
I HATE THAT.

380
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,954
UH, ROSS...

381
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,955
ARE YOU STILL MAD AT US?

382
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,456
YUP.

383
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,959
OH, GOOD, BECAUSE WE HAVE AN "I'M SORRY" SONG.

384
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,461
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M REALLY NOT IN THE MOOD.

385
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:06,465
LOOK, ROSS, I FEEL REALLY BAD.

386
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,468
I MEAN, YOU'RE GOING THROUGH ALL THIS STUFF

387
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,471
AND... I JUST ACTED LIKE A JERK.

388
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,472
YEAH, WE ARE SO SORRY.

389
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,976
YOU'RE KIND  OF STEPPING ON THE SONG.

390
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,478
LOOK... WE WERE WAY OUT OF LINE, ALL RIGHT?

391
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,480
WE TOTALLY SUPPORT YOU.

392
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,482
WHATEVER YOU DECIDE, WHATEVER YOU DO.

393
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,986
OKAY, NOW YOU'RE JUST TAKING LINES RIGHT OUT OF THE SONG.

394
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,988
LOOK, THIS IS HARD ENOUGH, OKAY.

395
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,991
I REALLY NEED YOU GUYS RIGHT NOW.

396
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:32,992
YES. EXACTLY.

397
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,493
AND THAT'S WHY...

398
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,995

399
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,997
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER TONIGHT

400
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,999
AND I'LL MAKE YOU YOUR FAVORITE DINNER?

401
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,500
COME ON.

402
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,002
OKAY.

403
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,005
THANKS, YOU GUYS.

404
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,507
PHEEBS, ARE YOU WEARING FUR?

405
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,509
OKAY, LET'S GET SOME PERSPECTIVE, PEOPLE.

406
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,512
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M WEAR ING A SEEING EYE DOG COAT.

407
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,017
HEY, YOU KNOW, ROSS

408
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,519
I, UH... I THINK I KIND OF UNDERSTAND

409
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,521
WHY I KIND OF LOST IT TODAY.

410
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,523
YOU DO, HUH?

411
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,526
YEAH, YOU SEE, I'M AN ACTOR, RIGHT?

412
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,530
SO I GOT TO KEEP MY EMOTIONS RIGHT AT THE SURFACE, YOU KNOW?

413
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,534
I GOT A LOT OF BALLS IN THE AIR, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

414
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,037
IT'S TOUGH.

415
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,539
GUYS LIKE ME, YOU KNOW, YOU WANDER AROUND--

416
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,540
YOU'RE ALONE.

417
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,045
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

418
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,548
I'M NOT SURE.

419
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,050
HI.

420
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,052
HEY, LOOK AT YOU. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

421
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,055
OH, I WENT TO HAVE PIZZA WITH DANNY.

422
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,057
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

423
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,559
THAT YETI IS ONE SMOOTH TALKER.

424
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,061
YETIS ARE SMOOTH TALKERS.

425
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,064
THAT'S WHY YOU NEVER SEE ANY PICTURES OF THEM.

426
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,566
"COME HERE, BABY, GIVE ME THE CAMERA."

427
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,068
I HOPE

428
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,569
YOU'RE NOT TOO FULL, BECAUSE DINNER'S ALMOST READY.

429
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,071
YEAH, YOU KNOW, I THINK

430
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,573
I'M PROBABLY JUST GOING TO HANG OUT IN MY ROOM.

431
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,574
OH, NO.

432
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,575
WHY?

433
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,077
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

434
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,079
IF EMILY KNEW I WAS HERE HAVING DINNER WITH YOU

435
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,081
SHE WOULD FLIP OUT AND YOU KNOW IT.

436
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,084
IT'S OKAY.

437
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,086
I REALLY... I DON'T MIND.

438
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,087
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

439
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,089
YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST STAY.

440
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,090
PLEASE.

441
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,593
IT WOULD REALLY MEAN A LOT FOR ME IF YOU STAY.

442
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,596
ROSS, I JUST...

443
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,597
RACHEL, PLEASE.

444
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,100
JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US.

445
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,601
OKAY, OKAY, JOEY, IT'S OKAY.

446
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,103
SETTLE DOWN.

447
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,604
ALL RIGHT. I'M SORRY.

448
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,106
I'M SORRY.

449
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,108
YOU SEE, RACH, I'M AN ACTOR.

450
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,113
HEY!

451
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,615
HEY, LOOK, THE UGLY NAKED GUY'S BACK.

452
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,617
OH, MY GOD!

453
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,120
WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN SO LONG.

454
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,123
OH, GOD, I REALLY MISSED THAT FAT BASTARD.

455
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,627
WOW. THIS IS SO WEIRD.

456
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,130
I JUST REALIZED THIS MAY BE THE LAST TIME

457
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,132
WE'RE ALL HANG ING OUT TOGETHER.

458
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,636
IT'S ALMOST AS IF HE KNEW.

459
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,138

460
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,140
I'LL GET IT.

461
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,144
HELLO.

462
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,645
HI, EMILY.

463
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,648
YEAH, YOU TRACKED HIM DOWN.

464
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,650
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

465
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,154
HEY.

00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,160
UH, YEAH, SURE. HOLD ON.

469
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,661
SHE WANTS TO SAY HI.

470
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,662
HOLD ON.

471
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,167
 HI, EMILY.

472
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,168
HELLO, EVERYONE.

473
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,171
SO, WHO AM I SAYING HELLO TO?

474
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,172
WELL, UH...

475
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,673
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT WHO'S HERE

476
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,675
BUT I CAN TELL YOU FOR DAMN SURE

477
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,178
WHO'S NOT HERE, AND THAT'S RACHEL.

478
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,182
Well, I should hope not.

479
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,684
Ross knows better than that by now.

480
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,189
YOU KNOW WHAT?

481
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,190
RACHEL IS HERE.

482
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,192
She's there?

483
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,693
OH, YEAH, THERE SHE IS.

484
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,697
YEAH, YEAH, SHE'S HERE.

485
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,699
ROSS, TAKE ME OFF SPEAKER PHONE.

486
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,701
HI.

487
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,703
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?

488
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,707
I THOUGHT I'D MADE MY FEELINGS ABOUT RACHEL PERFECTLY CLEAR.

489
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:12,711
LOOK, EMILY, I'M JUST HAVING DINNER WITH MY FRIENDS, OKAY?

490
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,214
YOU OBVIOUSLY CAN'T KEEP AWAY FROM HER.

491
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,715
EMILY, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

492
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,718
 HE... HELLO? HELLO?

493
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,719
WHO IS THIS?

494
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,222
IT'S ROSS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

495
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,725
SORRY, DUDE. I HAD TO MAKE A CALL.

496
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,229
JOEY? JO...

497
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:38,737
JOEY, THEY DON'T HAVE TWO LINES, THEY HAVE TWO PHONES.

498
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,739
GOTCHA.

499
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,743
I'M SORRY. EMILY, LISTEN.

500
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,746
I have never cheated on you.

501
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,248
LOOK, I'M MOVING FOR YOU.

502
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,750
I'M CUTTING FRIENDS OUT OF MY LIFE FOR YOU.

503
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,254
PLEASE, JUST GET ON THE PLANE AND COME TO NEW YORK, OKAY?

504
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,255
YOU'LL SEE.

505
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,757
You're the only person I want to be with.

506
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,759
I'LL FEEL BETTER WHEN I'M THERE

507
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,762
AND I CAN KNOW WHERE YOU ARE ALL THE TIME.

508
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,266
WELL, YOU...

509
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,269
YOU CAN'T KNOW WHERE I AM ALL THE TIME.

510
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,272
LOOK, THIS MARRIAGE IS NEVER GOING TO WORK

511
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,274
IF YOU DON'T TRUST ME.

512
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,277
YOU'RE RIGHT.

513
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:23,282
SO... CAN YOU TRUST ME?

514
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,788
NO.

515
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,793
I THINK IT'S GOING OKAY.

516
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,795
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE HE'S SMILING.

517
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,796
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

518
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,798
YOU CAN ONLY SEE THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.

519
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,301
YOU CAN TOTALLY TELL.

520
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,303
HERE, LOOK, WATCH ME.

521
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:48,307
SMILE. FROWN. SMILE.

522
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,809
FROWN... SMILE...

523
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,325
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S IT.

524
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,326
 WHAT?

525
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,328
WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT HAPPENED?

526
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,330
MY MARRIAGE IS OVER.

527
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,831
 SWEETIE...

528
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,333
OH, LOOK AT YOU.

529
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,335
YOU'RE SHIVERING.

530
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,337
HERE.

531
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,844
ROSS, HONEY, IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO?

532
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,348
YEAH.

533
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:33,352
YOU CAN HELP ME GET MY FURNITURE BACK FROM GUNTHER.

534
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,862

535
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,365

536
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,370

537
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,374
OKAY, STOP TORMENTING ME!

538
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,876
THIS IS MINK, OKAY?

539
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,379
THEY'RE MEAN AND THEY HATE SQUIRRELS.

540
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,380
AND, YOU KNOW, OKAY

541
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,383
MOST OF THESE PROBABLY WANTED TO BE COATS.

542
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,886
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

543
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,388
NO, I GET IT.

544
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,390
HERE, YOU TAKE IT.

545
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,393
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW? I'M COLD!
