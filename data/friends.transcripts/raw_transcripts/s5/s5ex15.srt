I MEAN, THAT'S MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE HAVE

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,022

DUDE, HE'S RIGHT THERE...

25
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,557
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY BEST FRIEND.

00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,558

27
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,061

00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,690
YOU CAN'T JUST CALL GODFATHER.

72
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:15,195
DON'T YOU THINK HER BROTHER SHOULD BE GODFATHER?

73
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,697

YOU COULD FIT HER RIGHT IN YOUR LITTLE POCKET.

91
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,236
SHE COULD  FIT

92
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,739
IN THAT LITTLE POCKET INSIDE THE POCKET.

93
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,741
I DON'T KNOW...

94
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,744
I MEAN, I LIKE HER A LOT, AND SHE'S REALLY NICE, BUT...

95
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,245

111
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,787

00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,833

135
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,336

00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,837

00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,847
NO, NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

143
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,850

144
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:55,355

146
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,859
OH.

147
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,361

00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,863
OKAY. I GET IT.

149
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,365
NO, WAIT. LOOK, LOOK...

150
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,868
I'M SORRY, IT'S JUST I'VE NEVER EVEN MET... HOWARD.

151
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,371
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW HOWARD.

152
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,874
HOWARD'S THE HANDYMAN?

153
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,877

154
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,379

OKAY, FINE.

156
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,383
WHATEVER.

157
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,386
WELCOME TO THE BUILDING.

158
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,387

159
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,389
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT GUY?

160
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,393
YEAH. I REALLY LIKE HIS GLASSES.

161
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,400
...SO THEN PRESIDENT STEVE TOLD EVERYONE

162
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,901
I WAS A CHEAPSKATE

163
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,903
AND NOW THE WHOLE BUILDING HATES ME.

164
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,406
YOU KNOW, A LITTLE KID SPIT ON MY KNEE.

165
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,910
AND TOLD ME TO WIPE IT OFF WITH MY HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL.

166
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,413
WELL, YOU REALLY SHOULD WIPE IT OFF WITH SOMETHING.

167
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,918
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO?

168
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,920
I'M GOING TO THROW A PARTY--

169
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,423
THAT'S RIGHT, FOR EVERYONE IN THE BUILDING.

170
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,924
I'M GOING TO SIT THEM ALL DOWN

171
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,427
AND EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT I AM NOT A BAD GUY.

172
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,428
I AM NOT A CHEAP GUY.

173
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,930
I'M JUST A GUY WHO WHO STANDS UP

174
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,432
FOR WHAT HE BELIEVES IN, A MAN...

175
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,434
WITH PRINCIPLES.

176
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,936
SOUNDS LIKE A FUN PARTY.

177
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,939
LOOK, ROSS, IF YOU WANT YOUR NEIGHBORS TO LIKE YOU

178
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,941
WHY DON'T YOU JUST PAY THE HUNDRED BUCKS?

179
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,944
A PARTY'S GOING TO COST YOU WAY MORE THAN THAT.

180
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,446
THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

181
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,448
IT'S MY PRINCIPLES.

182
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,450
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MY PRINCIPLES!

183
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,951
OKAY.

184
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,953
I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT YOUR NEIGHBORS LIKING YOU.

185
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,957
OH, THEY'LL LIKE ME ONCE THEY COME TO MY AWESOME PARTAY.

186
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,959
OKAY, I GOT TO RUN.

187
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,961
I GOT TO GO GET SOME NAME TAGS.

188
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,465

189
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,968
AND THAT CRAZY PARTY ANIMAL WILL BE YOUR BROTHER IN LAW.

190
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,470
OH, YEAH. VERY, VERY FUNNY.

191
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,972
BUT DON'T SAY THINGS LIKE THAT IN FRONT OF MONICA.

192
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,475
I DON'T WANT YOU PUTTING ANY IDEAS IN HER HEAD.

193
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,477
UM, CHANDLER, YOU YOU DO REALIZE

194
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,480
THAT THOSE IDEAS ARE PROBABLY ALREADY IN MONICA'S HEAD?

195
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,483
WH WHY?

196
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,987
WELL, BECAUSE SHE LOVES YOU AND BECAUSE YOU LOVE HER.

197
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,490
YEAH? SO? WHAT'S THAT'S SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

198
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,492
HEY, CHANDLER, DON'T FREAK OUT.

199
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,994
I'M TELLING YOU SOMETHING YOU ALREADY KNOW.

200
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,996
COME ON, SHE BROKE UP WITH RICHARD

201
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,998
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE BABIES

202
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,001
AND SHE'S A WOMAN, AND SHE'S ALMOST 30, AND, YOU KNOW...

203
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,003
IT'S MONICA.

204
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,506
I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY, OKAY? BECAUSE I SEE TWO MONICAS--

205
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,008
THE ONE THAT WAS MY FRIEND WHO LIVES ACROSS THE HALL

206
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,510
AND WANTED TO HAVE A LOT OF BABIES...

207
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,513
AND THEN THE NEW MONICA, WHO I JUST STARTED TO DATE.

208
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:38,017
OKAY, NOW, WHO'S TO SAY WHAT SHE WANTS?

209
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,519
I'M RIGHT. I'M RIGHT.

210
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,521
AM I RIGHT?

211
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,524
OH... ABSOLUTELY.

212
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,025
OKAY, AND YOU KNOW

213
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,027
I'M COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN RICHARD ANYWAY

214
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,530
BECAUSE HE'S AN EYE DOCTOR AND I DON'T WEAR GLASSES.

215
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,534
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

216
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,036
I MEAN, THAT MAKES EVERYTHING DIFFERENT.

217
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,037
OKAY.

218
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,038

219
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,540
IT'S NOT DIFFERENT AT ALL, IS IT?

220
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,042
NOT UNLESS "DIFFERENT" MEANS "THE SAME."

221
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,546
YOU WERE SO FUNNY WITH THAT WAITER.

222
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,548
YOU'RE SUCH ANUT!

223
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,055
WELL, YOU KNOW, BREAD STICK FANGS

224
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,557
ARE ALWAYS FUNNY, SO...

225
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,058
NO, YOU MAKE THEM FUNNY.

226
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,060
YOU'RE THE FUNNY ONE!

227
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,062
THANKS.

228
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,565
UH, LOOK, KATIE, UH...

229
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,567
LISTEN, WE WE NEED TO TALK, OKAY?

230
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,069
UM, LOOK, I LIKE YOU -- I I REALLY DO.

231
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,572
I LIKE YOU A LOT, OKAY?

232
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,075
BUT SOMETIMES WHEN YOU PLAYFULLY PUNCH ME LIKE THAT

233
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,578
IT IT FEELS LIKE SOMEONE'S HITTING ME

234
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,581
WITH A VERY TINY, BUT A VERY REAL BAT.

235
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,084
OH... LIKE I COULD HURT YOU.

236
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,086
ARE YOU MAKING FUN OF MY SIZE?

237
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,588
NO.

238
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,592
DON'T MAKE FUN OF ME BECAUSE OF MY SIZE!

239
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,094
YEAH, OKAY.

240
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,095
OH...

241
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,597
HMM...

242
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,098
ISN'T THIS GREAT?

243
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,099
MMM.

244
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,603
COULDN'T YOU JUST STAY LIKE THIS FOREVER?

245
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,106
CHANDLER?

246
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,609
COULDN'T YOU JUST STAY HERE FOREVER?

247
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,112
YEAH, HERE, SOMEWHERE ELSE... YOU KNOW, WHERE WHEREVER.

248
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,614

249
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,115
ARE YOU OKAY?

250
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,617
YEAH. I'M COOL.

251
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,619
CASUAL.

252
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,621
WHAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

253
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,123
OH, JUST HANGING OUT, YOU KNOW, HAVING FUN...

254
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,626
YOU KNOW, WITH THE GIRL THAT I'M SEEING CASUALLY

255
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,628
OH... MAN, I KNEW IT.

256
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,630
I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO DO THIS.

257
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,131
WHAT? GET ALL FREAKED OUT

258
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,634
BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS TALKING AND JUST JOKING AROUND

259
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,635
ABOUT MARRIAGE AND STUFF.

260
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,639
WELL, YOU YOU DO WANT ALL THAT STUFF, RIGHT?

261
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,140
OH, AND YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT.

262
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,642
YES. YOU WANT BABIES.

263
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,143
YOU HAVE BABY FEVER.

264
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,647
I DO NOT HAVE BABY FEVER.

265
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,149
OH, PLEASE. YOU ARE OBSESSED WITH BABIES AND MARRIAGE

266
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,652
AND EVERYTHING THAT'S RELATED TO BABIES

267
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,153
AND AND... MARRIAGE.

268
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,155
YOU KNOW WHAT? I GOT A GOOD IDEA.

269
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,157
WHY DON'T WE TURN THE HEAT DOWN

270
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,159
ON THIS PRESSURE COOKER?!

271
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,661
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

272
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,664
CHANDLER, THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME; THIS IS ABOUT YOU

273
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,166
AND ALL YOUR WEIRD RELATIONSHIP COMMITMENT CRAP.

274
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,167
NUH UH. I KNOW YOU, OKAY?

275
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,669
I KNOW THE THOUGHTS

276
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,671
THAT YOU HAVE IN THE HEAD-- IN YOUR HEAD.

277
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,172
WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING.

278
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,676
DID YOU KNOW THAT I'M GOING OUT WITH RACHEL TONIGHT

279
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,677
INSTEAD OF YOU, HMM?

280
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,180
AND DID YOU KNOW THAT THE ONLY BABY AROUND HERE IS YOU?

281
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,181
AND DID YOU KNOW

282
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,685
THAT I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT YOU RIGHT NOW?

283
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,186
YEAH, WELL, I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

284
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,694
THIS IS GOING TO BE OKAY, RIGHT?

285
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,696
I MEAN, SHE'S NOT GOING TO LEAVE ME.

286
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,697
THIS IS FIXABLE.

287
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,699
SURE. ABSOLUTELY.

288
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,700
BY ME.

289
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,701
OH, NO.

290
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,703
NO, NO, NO.

291
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,206
WELL, UNLESS YOU MAKE SOME KIND OF BIG GESTURE.

292
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,708
 YEAH, BIG, THOUGH.

293
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,210
UH OH! SHH! THE MISSUS.

294
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,714
GUNTHER, CAN  I GET A COFFEE?

295
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,717
TO GO?

296
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,718
LOOK, MONICA...

297
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,220
I'M STILL NOT DONE NOT WANTING TO TALK TO YOU.

298
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,722
JUST TELL ME WHAT I NEED TO DO

299
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,223
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

300
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,224
WHAT?

301
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,225
WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

302
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,228
YOU KNOW, I MESS UP, AND THEN YOU TELL ME HOW TO FIX IT

303
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:13,232
AND THEN I DO, AND THEN YOU THINK I'M ALL CUTE AGAIN.

304
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,235
I'M REALLY TIRED OF BEING YOUR RELATIONSHIP TUTOR.

305
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,738
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE THIS ONE OUT

306
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,240
FOR YOURSELF, ALL RIGHT?

307
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,243
IF YOU'RE TOO AFRAID TO BE IN A REAL RELATIONSHIP

308
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,244
THEN DON'T BE IN ONE.

309
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,756

310
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,757

320
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,786

HOWARD! HOWARD ! HOWARD! HOWARD

321
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,289

HOWARD! HOWARD ! HOWARD! HOWARD

322
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,791

HOWARD! HOWARD

323
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,794
HOWARD! HOWARD! HOWARD! HOWARD!

324
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,295
PHOEBE?

325
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,296
HOWARD! PHOEBE?

326
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,799
HOWARD! YAY! OH, HI, ROSS!

327
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,802
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

328
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,303
OH, I THOUGHT THIS WAS YOUR PARTY

329
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,806
AND IT TURNS OUT, IT'S A PARTY FOR HOWARD.

330
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,808
HE'S THE SWEETEST LITTLE MAN.

331
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,809
SEE YA, PHOEBE.

332
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,812
OH, AND, HEY, THANKS FOR CHIPPING IN.

333
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,813
OH, SURE.

334
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,816
YOU CHIPPED IN?

335
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,818
YEAH, UH HUH. $100.

336
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,320
PHOEBE, I I CAN'T BELI EVE YOU GAVE HIM MONEY.

337
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,323
I THOUGHT YOU AGREED IT WAS TOTALLY UNREASONABLE

338
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,325
THAT THEY ASKED  ME FOR THAT MONEY.

339
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,327
YEAH, BUT THEY DIDN'T ASK ME, YOU KNOW

340
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,830
AND THIS WAY I'M JUST THE EXOTIC, GENEROUS STRANGER

341
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,331
AND THAT'S ALWAYS FUN TO BE.

342
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,334
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE MAKING ME LOOK BAD.

343
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,335
NO, I'M NOT. NO.

344
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,337
IF ANYTHING, I'M MAKING YOU LOOK BETTER.

345
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,840
THEY'LL SEE YOU TALKING TO ME, AND THAT'S, YOU KNOW.

346
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,842
I'M A HIT.

347
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,843
HEY, PHEEBS.

348
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,844
HEY.

349
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,846
OH, HEY, ROSS.

350
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,347
UM, SAY, I WAS THINKING

351
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,349
MAYBE YOU TWO COULD SWITCH APARTMENTS

352
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,351
BECAUSE PHOEBE'S MORE OUR KIND OF PEOPLE.

353
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,853
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.

354
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,859
YEAH, OKAY, MY BAD.

355
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,369
HEY.

356
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,370
HI.

357
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,877
WOW, YOU LOOK... YOU LOOK BIG.

358
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,379
THANKS. I'VE BEEN WORKING OUT.

359
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,383
HEY, LISTEN, IS IT OBVIOUS I'M WEARING SIX SWEATERS?

360
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:48,888
UH, YEAH. BUT IT'S NOT OBVIOUS WHY.

361
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,390
WELL, LOOK, I'M BREAKING UP WITH KATIE.

362
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,392
SO I HAD TO PUT ON SOME EXTRA PADDING.

363
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,394
I MEAN, IF SHE HITS ME WHEN SHE'S HAPPY

364
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,897
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW HARD SHE'S GOING TO HIT ME

365
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,900
WHEN I TELL HER I'M TAKING AWAY THE JOEY LOVE?

366
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,402
OH... OH, RIGHT.

367
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,904
I FORGOT THAT  YOU CALL IT THAT.

368
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,405
YEAH.

369
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,907
HEY. HEY.

370
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:08,908
HOW ARE YOU?

371
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,911
HEY, CUTE JACKET.

372
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,412
OH, THANKS.

373
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,914
THAT'S SO SWEET. WHOA.

374
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,915
OW!

375
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,416

376
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,920
OH, "OW." DID JOEY TELL YOU TO SAY THAT?

377
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,922
YOU GUYS ARE TOO MUCH.

378
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,423
WHOA.

379
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,925
YOU KNOW WHAT, KATIE?

380
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,927
I GOT TO TELL YOU.

381
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:32,431
I I I THINK YOU'RE THE ONE THAT IS TOO MUCH.

382
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,433
OH, JOEY HAS THE NICEST FRIENDS.

383
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:39,438
OH, AND THE NICEST GIRLFRIEND.

384
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,940
OH...

385
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,941
YOU'RE SO SWEET.

386
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,443
WELL, YOU'RE SO SWEET.

387
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,946
OW!

388
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:54,453
JOEY... SHE JUST KICKED ME.

389
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,456
HUH.

390
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,960
WELL?

391
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,461
AREN'T YOU GOING TO DO SOMETHING?

392
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:03,462
UH...

393
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,964
YOU'D BETTER DO SOMETHING

394
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,966
OR I'M GOING TO WALK OUT THAT DOOR RIGHT NOW.

395
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,968
WELL?

396
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:09,969
ARE YOU GONNA?

397
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,472
NAH.

398
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,986

399
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:27,987
PHOEBE?

400
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,989
THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING.

401
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,490
PHOEBE, PHOEBE...

402
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,491
OOH.

403
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,993
LOOK, THIS IS A DISASTER.

404
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,995
CAN'T I PLEA SE JUST GO?

405
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,997
NO, NO. I'M TALKING YOU UP TO PEOPLE.

406
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,999
JUST GIVE IT A LITTLE TIME, ALL RIGHT?

407
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,000
RELAX. GET SOMETHING TO EAT.

408
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,501
OKAY?

409
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,504
SO, UH, WHAT

410
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,506
DID YOU TELL THEM ABOUT ME?

411
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,009
UM, OH, I WAS TELLING THEM ABOUT YOU AND EMILY.

412
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,510
YOU KNOW, TRY TO GET SOME SYMPATHY?

413
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,512
BUT SOMEHOW YOU CAME OFF AS THE BAD GUY.

414
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,514
WHAT?

415
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,016
YEAH. I THINK I TOLD IT WRONG.

416
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,019
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THAT

417
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,021
BECAUSE I DON'T TOTALLY UNDERSTAND

418
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,522
WHAT HAPPENED THERE.

419
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,026
OOH, THIS CAKE IS REALLY GOOD.

420
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,528
SEE? THINGS ARE LOOKING UP ALREADY.

421
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:13,032
OH, MY GOD, SOMEONE CUT HOWARD'S CAKE.

422
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,539
WHO WOULD DO A THING LIKE THAT?

423
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,046
3 B.

424
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,547
 OH, YEAH. AW, COME ON.

425
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,551
OKAY, YOU GOT YOUR FREE FOOD, YOU RUINED EVERYONE'S FUN.

426
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,553
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S TIME YOU WENT HOME?

427
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,055
 HEY, GO HOME.

428
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,557
GO BACK TO 3 B, 3 B.

429
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,059
OKAY, EVERYONE?

430
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,560
EVERYONE CALM DOWN.

431
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,063
I HAVE SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY.

432
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,567
WHO HERE LIKES ROSS?

433
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,574
WELL, OF COURSE YOU DON'T LIKE HIM.

434
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,576
HE DIDN'T GIVE YOU ANY MONEY.

435
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:01,080
HE RAISED HIS OWN HAND WHEN I ASKED, "WHO HERE LIKES ROSS?"

436
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,582
AND HE'S WEARING TWO NAME TAGS.

437
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,087
I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU GUYS.

438
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,589
WHEN I FIRST MET ROSS, I DIDN'T LIKE HIM AT ALL.

439
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,593
BUT THEN, ONCE I GOT TO KNOW HIM

440
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,596
I SAW THAT HE'S REALLY SWEET AND CARING

441
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,099
AND VERY GENEROUS.

442
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,101
I MEAN, ALL I'M SAYING IS DON'T JUDGE ROSS

443
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,103
BEFORE YOU GET TO KNOW HIM, ALL RIGHT?

444
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,605
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I LIKE ALL YOU GUYS NOW

445
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,108
BUT WHEN I FIRST MET YOU, YOU KNOW... CURT--

446
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,109
I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW

447
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,610
"ABRASIVE DRUNK."

448
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,114
UM, LOLA--

449
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,616
"MIND NUMBINGLY STUPID."

450
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,617
YOU KNOW, AND...

451
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,119
OKAY, YOU GUYS

452
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,622
"GOLD DIGGER," "CRADLE ROBBING PERV."

453
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,127
SO I THINK YOU ALL KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

454
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,634
OBVIOUSLY, I DIDN'T THINK

455
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,637
THEY WERE GOING TO START THROWING THINGS.

456
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,139
I JUST THOUGHT

457
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,140
IF I KEPT INSULTING THEM

458
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,642
YOU WOULD JUMP IN AND DEFEND EVERYONE

459
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,644
AND THEN YOU COULD LOOK LIKE THE HERO.

460
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,646
OH, WOW, YEAH.

461
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,649
SEE, I DID NOT GET THAT.

462
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,154
WHERE'S MONICA?

463
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,655
I NEED TO TALK TO HER.

464
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,157
IT'S URGENT. IS SHE HERE?

465
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,159
I'M MONICA.

466
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,161
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. IT'S URGENT.

467
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,162
OKAY.

468
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,164
OKAY, I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF THINKING

469
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,667
ABOUT US, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF, UH, "US" THINKING

470
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,171
AND, UH... WELL, I GUESS THERE'S ONLY ONE...

471
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,173
ONE WAY TO DO THIS.

472
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,175
NO, NO, NO.

473
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,178
WH WHAT...? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

474
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,179
MONICA...

475
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,680
NO, NO, NO. DON'T... DON'T DO IT.

476
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,682
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

477
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,687
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

478
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,688
WHAT A BAD IDEA.

479
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,191
OH, I CAN'T NOT LOOK AT IT.

480
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,195
CHANDLER, WHY  ARE YOU DOING THIS?

481
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,196
I DON'T KNOW.

482
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,699
BUT I KNOW I'M NOT AFRAID TO DO THIS.

483
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,201
CHANDLER...

484
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,704
I'M DOING THIS BECAUSE I'M SORRY?

485
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,707
D DO YOU, UM, YOU REALLY THINK

486
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,709
THE BEST REASON TO GET MARRIED

487
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,211
IS BECAUSE YOU'RE SORRY?

488
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,213
WELL, NO. THE BEST REASON TO GET MARRIED

489
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,714
IS PREGNANCY.

490
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,718
BUT "SORRY" IS PRETTY MUCH FOURTH

491
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,720
YOU KNOW, BEHIND "BEING READY"

492
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,223
AND "ACTUALLY WANTING TO GET MARRIED."

493
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,724
WILL YOU BE MY WIFE?

494
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,228
CHANDLER, UM, I WANT YOU TO TAKE JUST A MINUTE

495
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,230
AND I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT

496
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,232
HOW RIDICULOUS THIS SOUNDS.

497
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,239
YEAH, I'M KIND OF WISHING EVERYONE WASN'T HERE RIGHT NOW.

498
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,241
OH, HONEY, DO YOU KNOW

499
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,743
THAT NONE OF THAT STUFF CAME FROM ME?

500
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,245
I MEAN, I NEVER SAID THAT I WANTED

501
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,747
TO HAVE BABIES AND GET MARRIED RIGHT NOW.

502
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,249
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT I WAS REALLY CONFUSED

503
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,750
AND THEN I TALKED TO THESE GUYS

504
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,753
WHO, TWO DIVORCES AND JOEY?

505
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,255
HEY.

506
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,757
SHE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW.

507
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,261
YEAH, BUT STILL, CHEAP SHOT.

508
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,264
YOU KNOW WHAT?

509
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,766
YOU WHEN I WHEN I SAID THAT I WANT YOU TO DEAL

510
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,269
WITH THIS RELATIONSHIP STUFF ALL ON YOUR OWN

511
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,271
WELL, YOU'RE NOT READY FOR THAT.

512
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,773
I DIDN'T THINK I WAS.

513
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,275
COME HERE.

514
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,279
OH, MY GOD.

515
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,782
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IF I HAD SAID YES?

516
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,284
WELL, I WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY

517
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,787
BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE

518
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,289
WITH THE WOMAN THAT I LOVE.

519
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,791
OR YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN A CHANDLER SHAPED HOLE

520
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,293
IN THAT DOOR.

521
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,799
HEY, ROSS, YOU PASS ME THAT KNIFE?

522
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,801
NO, I WILL NOT.

523
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,304
OH, IT'S OKAY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SO MEAN ABOUT IT.

524
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,805
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY.

525
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,307
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

526
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,312
OH, AND I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU TO MARRY ME

527
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,814
BECAUSE I FORGOT TO SAY HELLO TO YOU LAST WEEK.

528
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,816
OH, NO, WAIT, PHEEBS, I THINK

529
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,818
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YOU JUST ASK THEM

530
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,820
TO MOVE IN WITH YOU, BUT I'M NOT SURE.

531
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,821
CHANDLER?

532
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,324
OKAY, HOW LONG IS THIS GOING TO GO ON?

533
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,326
WELL, I THINK THE LENGTH OF TEASING

534
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,828
IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO HOW INSANE YOU WERE

535
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,830
SO A LONG TIME.

536
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,332
THIS IS FUN.

537
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,834
HEY, RACH, REMEMBER THAT WHOLE "WE WERE ON A BREAK" THING?

538
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,836
WELL, I'M SORRY. WILL YOU MARRY ME?

539
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,338

540
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,839

541
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,344
 THAT'S NOT FUNNY.
