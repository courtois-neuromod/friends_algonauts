1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,004
OKAY, PICK A CARD. OKAY.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,506
ALL RIGHT. NOW... MEMORIZE IT.

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:07,507
YOU GOT IT?

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,508
OH, YES.

5
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:12,512
OKAY. IS THAT YOUR CARD?

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,516
YES.

7
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,019
YEAH, IT IS.

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,020
HEY, GUYS.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,522
HI, THERE!  HI!

10
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:27,027
GUESS WHAT. BEN IS GOING TO BE  IN A TV COMMERCIAL.

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,029
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,530
WELL, IT'S NOT FOR SURE

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,032
BUT, UH, WE MET THIS GUY IN THE PARK

14
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,034
WHO THOUGHT BEN WAS REALLY CUTE, YOU KNOW...

15
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,535
WHICH HE IS.

16
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,537
UM, ANYHOO, HE, UH, HE GAVE US HIS CARD

17
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,539
AND TOLD US TO BRING HIM DOWN

18
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,541
FOR THIS COMMERCIAL HE'S AUDITIONING.

19
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,043
WHOA. THIS GUY'S, LIKE

20
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,046
THE BIGGEST COMMERCIAL CASTING DIRECTOR IN TOWN!

21
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,049
BEN TAKES ONE LOUSY WALK IN THE PARK

22
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,050
AND GETS AN AUDITION?!

23
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,555
I MEAN, "WAY TO GO, BEN!"

24
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,559
MAN, I'VE BEEN IN THAT PARK A MILLION TIMES.

25
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,062
NO ONE'S EVER OFFERED ME AN AUDITION.

26
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,564
I KNOW. IT'S CRAZY-- WE WERE JUST PUSHING BEN ON THE SWINGS...

27
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,067
I'M ALWAYS ON THE SWINGS!

28
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,070
WHAT AM I DOING WRONG?

29
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,072
THAT.

43
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,623
OKAY, GOT TO GO. WISH ME LUCK.

44
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,625
HEY, RACH, NOW THAT YOU'RE WORKING AT RALPH LAUREN

45
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,128
CAN YOU BRING ME BACK SOME OF THOSE POLO SHIRTS?

46
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,129
UH, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

47
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,131
I DON'T KNOW IF I'D FEEL COMFORTABLE

48
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,133
STEALING ON MY VERY FIRST DAY.

49
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,136
UNWILLING TO STEAL FROM WORK... INTERESTING.

50
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,139
BESIDES, IF ANYBODY'S GOING TO GET FREE STUFF

51
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,640
IT'S GOING TO BE ME.

52
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,142
OKAY, GUYS, WAY TO WISH ME LUCK.

53
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,144
GOOD LUCK. HAVE A GOOD DAY.

54
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,645
BYE.

55
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,148
OKAY, LET'S DISCUSS RACHEL'S BIRTHDAY.

56
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,650
I SAY WE THROW HER A SURPRISE PARTY THIS WEEKEND.

57
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,153
WHOA, BUT HER BIRTHDAY'S NOT FOR, LIKE, ANOTHER MONTH.

58
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,655
OKAY, BUT IF WE THROW HER A PARTY ON HER BIRTHDAY

59
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,656
THEN IT'S NOT A SURPRISE.

60
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,158
I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

61
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,160
WE CAN HAVE A DINNER PARTY

62
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,162
AND JUST INVITE HER CLOSE FRIENDS.

63
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,164
ROSS! WE'RE HAVING A SURPRISE PARTY FOR RACHEL!

64
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,665
 OKAY!

65
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,667
DONE.

66
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,171
OKAY, GREAT. SO DO YOU WANT TO DO IT TOGETHER?

67
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,173
I WOULD LOVE TO DO IT TOGETHER.

68
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,174
OOH!

69
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,176

70
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,179
THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT TOGETHER.

71
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,181
DUDE, THAT'S MY GIRLFRIEND.

72
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,183
OH, SO I GOT TO SHUT IT DOWN NOW?

73
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,185
ALL RIGHT. I GOT TO TAKE OFF.

74
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,687
I'M PICKING UP BEN , AND THEN WE'RE OFF

75
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,688
TO THE BIG AUDITION.

76
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,190
I BET IT'S GOING TO BE WEIRD

77
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,691
SEEING SOME ACTOR

78
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,692
PRETENDING  TO BE BEN'S DAD.

79
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,194
YEAH.

80
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,196
WEIRDER THAN SEEING

81
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,198
HIS TWO MOMS MAKE OUT?

82
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,699
WHOA, WHOA. "DAD"?

83
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,201
THERE'S A DAD IN THE COMMERCIAL?

84
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,702
YEAH. THE DAD AND BEN EAT SOUP

85
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,704
AND PRETEND TO ENJOY IT.

86
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,206
WHOA, HEY, WELL, MAYBE I'LL GO DOWN THERE WITH YOU

87
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,707
AND SEE IF I CAN GET AN AUDITION AS THE DAD.

88
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,210
I MEAN, WHO BETTER THAN TO PLAY BEN'S FATHER THAN HIS GODFATHER?

89
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,211
YOU'RE NOT HIS GODFATHER.

90
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,712
WHAT?!

91
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,715
ARE YOU KIDDING?!

92
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,718
OF COURSE I AM.

93
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,220

94
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,222
OKAY, LET'S GO , GODFATHER.

95
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,723
ALL RIGHT! WHOA.

96
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,231
HEY! I'M IN.

97
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,233
THEY'RE GOING TO LET ME AUDITION.

98
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,734
REALLY? THAT'S GREAT.

99
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,736
IT TURNS OUT ONE OF THE CASTING LADIES

100
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,238
HAS ACTUALLY SEEN ME IN A PLAY

101
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,739
SO I STEERED CLEAR OF HER.

102
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,241
AND THE OTHER ONE

103
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,243
I KNOW FROM... WELL, YOU KNOW.

104
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,247
 HEY, THAT KID LOOKS FAMILIAR.

105
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,250
OH, YEAH, YEAH . HE'S DONE TONS OF COMMERCIALS.

106
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,752
I'VE SEEN HIM IN, LIKE , SUGAR SMACKS, PLAYSTATION

107
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,254
AND THAT ONE FOR THE PHONE COMPANY.

108
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,256
IN FACT, HE WAS SO GOOD IN THAT ONE

109
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,758
HE ACTUALLY CONVINCED ME TO SWITCH PHONE COMPANIES.

110
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,760
CHANDLER WAS MAD...

111
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,763
YEAH, WELL, HE'S NOT GOING TO GET THIS ONE, ALL RIGHT?

112
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,265
BEN IS WAY CUTER THAN THAT KID.

113
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,267
I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM-- LOOK AT YOU!

114
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,770

115
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,273

116
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,774
THAT'S... GREAT.

117
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,776
LISTEN, WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT, THOUGH

118
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,278
IF I GOT TO PLAY BEN'S DAD?

119
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,779
JOEY, YOU LOOK NOTHING LIKE BEN.

120
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:44,284
I LOOK MORE LIKE HIM THAN YOU DO.

121
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,786
YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH

122
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,288
FOR YOU TO DO THAT.

123
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,795
SO, IT'S DOWN TO THESE TWO.

124
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:59,299
NANCY, I KNOW YOU LIKE THIS ONE, AND I THINK I AGREE.

125
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,301
RACHEL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

126
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,303
WELL, UM, I MEAN, THAT ONE IS PRETTY

127
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,805
BUT, OH, I JUST... I JUST LOVE THIS FABRIC.

128
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,307
SORRY.

129
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,808
OH, DON'T BE SORRY.

130
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,810
THAT'S PART OF YOUR JOB HERE TO GIVE YOUR OPINIONS

131
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,812
AND THEN I TAKE CREDIT FOR THEM. I'M KIDDING.

132
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,314
SHE IS KIDDING...

133
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,317
BUT DON'T EVER DISAGREE WITH HER AGAIN.

134
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,818
OKAY, NOW I'M KIDDING.

135
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,322
OH, WHAT A FUN OFFICE.

136
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,325
I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE, BUT I DO KNOW I NEED A CIGARETTE

137
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,827
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY WE TAKE A BREAK, WE GO OUTSIDE

138
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,330
AND WE'LL FIGURE THIS THING OUT WHEN WE COME BACK?

139
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,832
RACHEL?

140
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,833
YEAH?

141
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,835
YOU SMOKE?

142
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,337
OH, NO. MY DAD'S A DOCTOR

143
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,839
AND HE WOULD ALWAYS TELL ME JUST HORROR STORIES...

144
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,345
ABOUT, UH, GHOSTS AND GOBLINS...

145
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:51,351
WHO... TOTALLY SUPPORTED THE PRINCESS' RIGHT TO SMOKE.

146
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,858
AND THEN THEY CAME BACK FROM SMOKING

147
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,361
AND THEY HAD MADE ALL OF THE DECISIONS WITHOUT ME.

148
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,363
THAT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.

149
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,864
I KNOW. IT'S LIKE I'M BEING PUNISHED

150
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,866
FOR NOT HAVING THIS DISGUSTING, POISONOUS HABIT.

151
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,868
YEAH, IT IS THE BEST.

152
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,370
I MEAN

153
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,372
I MEAN, WHAT IF THIS KEEPS HAPPENING, YOU KNOW?

154
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,873
THEY'LL THEY'LL BE OUTSIDE SMOKING

155
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,876
MAKING ALL THE DECISIONS, AND I'LL JUST BE UP IN MY OFFICE

156
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,878
BREATHING IN MY STUPID CLEAN AIR, YOU KNOW?

157
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,380
AND THEN, WHEN THE DAY COMES

158
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,382
WHEN KIM WANTS TO PROMOTE ONE OF US

159
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,385
WHO DO YOU THINK SHE'S GOING TO PICK-- ME OR SMOKEY SMOKERSON?

160
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,387
WE USED TO HAVE A SMOKING AREA AT WORK.

161
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,888
IT WAS GREAT.

162
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,890
THERE WAS THIS BIG FLOWER POT WITH DIRT IN IT

163
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,892
AND WE USED TO PUT, LIKE, OUR CIGARETTES OUT IN IT.

164
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,394
ONE OF THE OLD TIMERS TOLD ME

165
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,895
THERE USED TO BE A LITTLE TREE IN THERE.

166
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,898
RACHEL, YOU CAN GO DOWN THERE.

167
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,899
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SMOKE.

168
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,902
JUST SAY YOU WANT TO GET SOME... FRESH AIR.

169
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,405
YEAH, I COULD DO THAT.

170
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,408
YEAH, OR IF YOU JUST DO THE EASY THING AND SMOKE.

171
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,412
YOU KNOW, TAKE LONG, DEEP DRAGS...

172
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,914

173
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,918
WOW. I STILL DON'T HAVE MY LUNG CAPACITY BACK YET.

174
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,420
 HEY.

175
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,921
OH, HEY, RACH, DO YOU WANT TO GO GET COFFEE?

176
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:02,922
OH, I WOULD LOVE TO.

177
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,923
OH, GOOD!

178
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,425
I'M GOING TO GO, TOO, BABE.

179
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,427
OH, GOOD.

180
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,428
YAY. YAY. YAH.

181
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,929
OH, I CHANGED MY MIND.

182
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,432
OKAY.

183
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,934
OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PARTY.

184
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,436
I HAVE SO MANY IDEAS.

185
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,937
ME, TOO!

186
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,938
OH!

187
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,440
YEAH!

188
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,442
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

189
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,943
ALL RIGHT.

190
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,945
HERE'S A LITTLE SKETCH OF THE CAKE.

191
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,447
UH HUH. SEE?

192
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,948
UM, SOME SAMPLE MENUS, UM...

193
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,450
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT WE'D START OUT

194
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,951
WITH TUSCAN STYLE FINGER FOOD, OKAY?

195
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,955
AND, FOR MUSIC, HERE'S AN ALPHABETIZED LIST OF ALL OF MY CDs.

196
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,457
I'VE HIGHLIGHTED THE ONES

197
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,959
THAT'LL GO REALLY GOOD WITH THE FOOD.

198
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,961
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INTIMATE DINNER PARTY?

199
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,963
YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT DOING THAT, OKAY?

200
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,465
WOW. ALL RIGHT.

201
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,967
LOOKS LIKE YOU TOOK CARE OF EVERYTHING.

202
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,469
THANKS A LOT, COHOST.

203
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,970
WAIT A MINUTE.

204
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,472
I DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.

205
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,474
THERE'S PLENTY OF THINGS FOR YOU TO DO.

206
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,475
UH HUH. LIKE WHAT?

207
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,477
CUPS!

208
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,480
CUPS? YOU'RE GIVING ME CUPS?

209
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,482
AND ICE.

210
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,983
CUPS AND ICE?

211
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,986
OH, I GET TO BE IN CHARGE OF CUPS AND ICE?

212
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,488
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

213
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,990
OKAY, I WILL BE IN CHARGE OF CUPS AND ICE.

214
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,492
WAIT A MINUTE.

215
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,993
I CAN GET ICE AT THE RESTAURANT.

216
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:14,994
I GOT IT! MINE!

217
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,998
 HEY. HI.

218
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:19,999
HOW'D THE AUDITION GO?

219
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,002
NOT SO GOOD.

220
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,504
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

221
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,005

222
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,008

00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,510
YEAH, IT DID!"?

224
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,513
YEAH, I AM!

225
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,014

226
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,517
YEAH, BEN GOT A SECOND AUDITION!

227
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,518

228
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,020
YEAH, I HAD TO TEACH ROSS MY BIT

229
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,523
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY DIDN'T GET A CALLBACK.

230
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,526
YOU GOT A CALLBACK , TOO, DIDN'T YOU?

231
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,530
YEAH, I DID!

232
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,538
HEY, RACHEL, WHAT  ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?

233
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,540
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT GOT KIND OF LONELY UP THERE

234
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,542
SO I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD COME OUT HERE AND...

235
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,043
GET SOME FRESH AIR.

236
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,045

237
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,547
NANCY AND I WE RE TALKING ABOUT  THE FALL COLLECTION.

238
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:08,548
OH, GREAT.

239
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,049
SO, ANYWAY...

240
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,051
HONEY, I'M SORRY. WE'RE SMOKING ALL OVER YOU.

241
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,553
OH, THAT'S OKAY.

242
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,555
WE'LL MOVE. YOU STAY RIGHT HERE.

243
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,056
 YOU KNOW, I SENT THE DESIGNS OVER TO RALPH

244
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,058
AND HE WAS VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE LOOK.

245
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,059
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

246
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,061
YOU ARE THE BEST.

247
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,064
EXCUSE ME, CAN  I BUM ONE OF THOSE?

248
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,066
YEAH, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY...

249
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,068

250
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,071
OKAY, OKAY, WHAT'S SO FUNNY OVER HERE?

251
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,574
I THOUGHT  YOU DIDN'T SMOKE.

252
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,576
OH, YOU KNOW, I I THOUGHT

253
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,580
YOU GUYS MEANT MARIJUANA CIGARETTES, YOU KNOW?

254
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,582
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

255
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,584
LIKE, DOOBIES?

256
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,086
ACTUALLY, I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, "WOW, THOSE GUYS ARE CRAZY!"

257
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,088
BUT, NO, ACTUALLY, I SMOKE THE REGULAR ONES

258
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,590
ALL... ALL THE TIME.

259
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,592
WE GET HIGH.

260
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,096
ME, TOO.

261
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,598
I'M KIDDING.

262
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,099
OH!

263
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,601
ME, TOO.

264
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,106
OH, GOD, THIS IS SO NERVE RACKING.

265
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,608
HOW HOW DO YOU DO THIS?

266
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,610
WELL, FORTUNATELY, I DON'T GET MANY CALLBACKS.

267
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,111
IS IT A GOOD SIGN

268
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,114
THAT THEY ASKED US TO HANG AROUND AFTER THE AUDITION?

269
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,617
WHO KNOWS?

270
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:22,622
OKAY, UH, WE HAVE NARROWED IT DOWN TO RAYMOND, BEN

271
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,123
KYLE AND JOEY.

272
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,627
THE REST OF YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

273
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,128
YES! I KNEW IT!

274
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,630
BYE BYE...

275
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,134
SO LONG...

276
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,636
LATER.

277
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,638
I'M NOT MARRIED TO HIM ANYMORE.

278
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,139
HE'S MY EX HUSBAND.

279
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,140
I'M TOTALLY GAY.

280
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,642
ROSS, THIS IS GREAT.

281
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,644
I MIGHT ACTUALLY GET TO PLAY BEN'S DAD.

282
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,146
ACTUALLY, THAT CAN'T HAPPEN.

283
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,649
BECAUSE YOU ALL HAVE SUCH DIFFERENT LOOKS

284
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,150
WE'RE PUTTING  YOU WITH RAYMOND

285
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,652
AND KYLE WITH BEN.

286
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,655
SO IT'LL EITHER BE YOU TWO OR YOU TWO.

287
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,156
OH, MAN...

288
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,160
THIS IS GOING TO BE KIND OF WEIRD, HUH?

289
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,662
YEAH, IT IS.

290
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,165
YEAH. IT'S GOING TO BE WEIRD.

291
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,668
NO, WE'RE WE'RE, LIKE, BEST FRIENDS.

292
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,170
THAT'S THAT'S WHY IT'S WEIRD.

293
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,171
OH, OH.

294
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,675
I I THOUGHT WE WERE JUST... TALKING.

295
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,183
HEY, ROSS, IF BEN GETS THIS COMMERCIAL

296
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,686
DO YOU THINK HE CAN GET ME SOME FREE SOUP?

297
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,189
CHANDLER, A CAN OF SOUP IS, LIKE, 60 CENTS.

298
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,191
YEAH, OKAY, BUT I HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING

299
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,193
A 29 YEAR OLD ITALIAN FOR FIVE YEARS.

300
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,696
HEY.

301
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,698
IS IT OKAY IF I LEAVE THIS STUFF HERE

302
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,700
TILL RACHEL'S BIRTHDAY PARTY?

303
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,701
SURE. WHAT'S IN THEM?

304
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,703
UM, CUPS.

305
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,707
OH, GOOD, BECAUSE WE GOT RACHEL 800 GALLONS OF WATER.

306
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,710
SERIOUSLY, THAT'S A LOT OF CUPS.

307
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,212
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE I'M IN CHARGE OF CUPS AND ICE

308
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,714
AND MONICA IS GOING TO RUE THE DAY

309
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,716
THAT SHE PUT ME IN CHARGE OF CUPS AND ICE.

310
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,219
YOU KNOW, I RUED THE DAY ONCE.

311
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,221
DIDN'T GET A WHOLE LOT ELSE DONE.

312
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,725
OKAY, TIME TO BRING UP THE REST OF THE CUPS.

313
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,228
OH, HEY, JOEY.

314
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,229
HEY, PHEEBS.

315
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,230
 HEY.

316
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,232
ROSS, GOOD. I'M, UH, GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

317
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,735
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

318
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,737
OH? WHAT'S UP?

319
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,740
WELL, I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS WHOLE COMMERCIAL THING.

320
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,742
YOU KNOW, ME GOING UP AGAINST BEN

321
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,744
THE TWO OF US COMPETING, AND...

322
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,746
WELL, THAT CAN'T LEAD TO ANYTHING GOOD

323
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,249
SO... I THINK I'M JUST GOING TO STEP ASIDE.

324
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,252
I'M GOING TO TELL THEM THAT I WON'T AUDITION.

325
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,255
WOW, UH... JOEY, THAT'S... THAT'S GREAT.

326
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,757
THANKS, MAN.

327
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,263
THAT'S IT?

328
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,767
YOU YOU'RE GOING TO LET ME DO THIS?

329
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,769
THIS IS MY CAREER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

330
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,770
BUT... BUT YOU JUST...

331
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,772
I JUST SAID THAT SO YOU WOULDN'T

332
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,774
LET BEN DO IT.

333
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,276
LOOK, ROSS, IF ANYONE SHOULD STEP ASIDE, IT SHOULD BE BEN.

334
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,277
WHAT?

335
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,279
WHAT?! CHANDLER, TELL HIM.

336
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,784
WELL, LET ME... LET ME GET THE DOOR FIRST.

337
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,287
OH, HI, NO ONE.

338
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,292
WHY SHOULD BEN STEP ASIDE?

339
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,795
IT WAS HIS AUDITION IN THE FIRST PLACE.

340
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,296
YOU JUST TAGGED ALONG.

341
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,799
YOU'RE LIKE THE... THE TAG ALONG DAD.

342
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,801
AT LEAST I CARE ABOUT HIS FEELINGS.

343
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,302
WH WH WHAT?

344
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,804
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD THIS IS GOING TO BE ON HIM

345
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,305
WHEN HE DOESN'T GET IT?

346
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,808
AND WHY WOULDN'T HE GET IT?

347
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,809
OH, COME ON.

348
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,311
HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT MY KID CAN DO?

349
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,313
HUH?

350
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,315
I MEAN, HE DIALS PHONES

351
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,817
HE HE EATS TORTILLA CHIPS.

352
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,820
HE HE PLAYS SOCCER WITH THE CARTOON TIGER.

353
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,824
ARE YOU SAYING YOUR KID EATS SOUP BETTER THAN MY KID?

354
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,827
YOU JUST GIVE  HIM A SPOON, BABY.

355
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,828
OH, YEAH? I GUESS WE'LL SEE.

356
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,329
YEAH

357
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,331
BECAUSE THIS COMMERCIAL BELONGS TO ME AND MITCH.

358
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,333
YOUR KID'S NAME IS RAYMOND.

359
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,334
YEAH? SO'S YOURS!

360
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,342
HOW DID WORK GO? OH, IT WAS GREAT.

361
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,344
I WENT DOWN THERE JUST LIKE YOU SAID

362
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,846
YOU KNOW, AND WE TALKED BUSINESS

363
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,848
AND KIM TOTALLY TOOK MY OPINIONS.

364
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,349
YOU STINK.

365
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,852
THANKS.

366
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,854
NO, I'M I'M SERIOUS.

367
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,856
WELL, THAT THAT'S JUST BECAUSE I WENT DOWN THERE

368
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,357
AND THEY WERE ALL SMOKING.

369
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,859
THIS IS ACTUALLY THE SMELL OF SUCCESS.

370
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,862
OKAY, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT, THOUGH.

371
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,864
OH, MY GOD. YOU SMOKED.

372
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,865

373
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,366
I DID NOT.

374
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,367
YES, YOU DID.

375
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,870
YOU LOOK HAPPY AND SICK-- YOU SMOKED!

376
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,872
ALL RIGHT, FINE, BUT I HAD TO.

377
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,874
I HAD TO DO  IT FOR MY CAREER.

378
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,878
I WISH I HAD TO SMOKE FOR MY CAREER.

379
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,880
BUT IT'S SO GROSS.

380
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,382
DON'T... NO, WELL, NO, IT'S NOT THAT BAD, YOU KNOW.

381
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,885
IT'S... I MEAN, YEAH, MY TONGUE FEELS A LITTLE FUZZY

382
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,887
AND MY FINGERS SORT OF SMELL.

383
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,389
I ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE I COULD THROW UP.

384
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,891
CAN YOU HEAR YOURSELF?

385
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,893
I KNOW. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

386
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,394
I... I'M NOT MYSELF.

387
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,896
I SMOKED, LIKE, HALF A PACK.

388
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,397
I FEEL A LITTLE SHAKY

389
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,398
AND A LITTLE WEIRD.

390
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,401
OKAY, BUT YOU GOT TO PUSH PAST THIS, OKAY?

391
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,904
BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT TO GET SO GOOD.

392
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:05,905
CHANDLER.

393
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,408
OH, I GOT TO TELL YOU, YOU SMELL SO SMOKY

394
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,409
I GOT... I I GOT TO GET UP.

395
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,410
WHAT?

396
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,411
I'M NOT KIDDING.

397
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,914
I THINK YOU SMELL GREAT.

398
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:23,422
SO WE'RE DECIDED-- NO ON PLAID, YES ON PINK.

399
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,424
ABSOLUTELY.

400
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,927
I'M SO ON BOARD.

401
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,929
MM HMM.

402
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,931
RACHEL, DIDN'T YOU JUST LIGHT THAT?

403
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,933
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

404
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,436
I'M JUST REALLY, REALLY TRYING TO CUT BACK, YOU KNOW.

405
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,938
GOOD LUCK, RACH.

406
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,942
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN THINKING ABOUT QUITTING LATELY.

407
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,443
OH, WELL, SURE-- EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT

408
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,945
I TELL MYSELF I'M QUITTING.

409
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,947
EVERY MONDAY MORNING, IT'S LIKE...

410
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,948
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

411
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,449
WELL, LET'S JUST QUIT.

412
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,951
WE'LL JUST QUIT. LET'S ALL QUIT.

413
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,953
IT DOES SOUND APPEALING.

414
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:54,954
I NEVER COULD DO IT.

415
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,455
OH, BUT YOU COULD. YOU CAN. ABSOLUTELY.

416
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,957
WE CAN HELP EACH OTHER OUT.

417
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,459
YOU KNOW, WE COULD GET-- WHAT? WHAT?-- THOSE PATCHES.

418
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,461
WE COULD BE LIKE THE PATCH SISTERS.

419
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,463
WELL, YOU KNOW, WE REALLY SHOULD QUIT.

420
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,965
OKAY, LET'S QUIT.

421
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,467
YES. GREAT. GIVE ME THOSE CIGS.

422
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,969
COME ON, GIVE IT. GIVE IT.

423
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,970
OUT, DONE. QUIT. WHOO!

424
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,974
MY LATE HUSBAND GAVE ME THAT LIGHTER.

425
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,976
SHE'S FUNNY.

426
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,978
I'M NOT KIDDING.

427
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,480
OKAY, THEN. OKAY.

428
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,485

THERE'S TONS OF REJECTION.

440
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,019
NO STABILITY.

00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,525
RIGHT OUT OF THE BOTTLE.

444
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,027
IT'S A TOUGH LIFE.

00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,528
I MEAN, SURE, OKAY

446
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,031

00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,041

SO HERE'S WHAT, UH...

00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,066
ARE YOU SURE THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SOMEWHERE BEFORE?

461
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,569
NO. I HAVEN'T BEEN IN ANY PLAYS.

462
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,571
ALL RIGHT. WELL, LET'S... LET'S TRY ONE.

463
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,073
WHENEVER YOU GUYS ARE READY.

464

WELL, THIS IS NOODLE SO UP

467
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,580

SO... BUT THAT'S OKAY.

469
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,583
NO PROBLEM, NO PROBLEM.

00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,085
MMM, NOODLE SOUP.

471
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,086
YEAH.

472
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,587
YOU KNOW, THAT THAT'S FINE

473
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,589
BUT THE LINE IS, "MMM, SOUP."

474
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,091
OH. WHAT DID I SAY?

475
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,592
"MMM, NOODLE SOUP."

476
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,096
HOW'S THAT DIFFERENT?

477
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,602
OH! I SEE, YEAH.

478
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,603

480
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:33,612
MMM, NOODLE SO UP.

481
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,615
OKAY.

482
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,117
LET'S... DO IT AGAIN.

483
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,618
OKAY.

484
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,623
MMM, SOUP.

485
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,624

489
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,131
WE NEED TO MOVE ON.

490
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,133
NO, I COULD DO IT ONE MORE TIME.

491
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,134
SEE, LOOK.

492
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,137

00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,647
TO THE MAGAZINE BY MONDAY, WE'RE GOING TO BE FINE.

496
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,649

497
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,650
I'M GREAT.

498
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,152
NO, WITH THE NOT SMOKING THING.

499
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,155
OH. WELL.. KILL... ME... NOW.

500
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,656
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

501
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,158
I ATE

502
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,160
40 MALLOMARS TODAY.

503
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,663
I HAVE... I HAVE PATCHES ALL OVER MY BODY, YOU KNOW?

504
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,166
I MEAN, I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN TWO DAYS.

505
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,167
WE QUIT YESTERDAY.

506
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,670
THAT'S COUNTING TODAY.

507
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,172
BUT, ANYWAY

508
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,174
SO THESE SAMPLES, I THINK...

509
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,675
OH, MY GOD!

510
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,177
OH, I'M SO SORRY. I FORGOT.

511
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,179
I HAVE TO GO  TO THE MAIL ROOM

512
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,680
AND MAIL SOME PROOFS.

513
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,681
OH, WELL, GO AHEAD.

514
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,184
RACHEL AND I WILL JUST SIT HERE AND KEEP BRAINSTORMING.

515
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,685

518
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,689
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M A LITTLE HUNGRY.

519
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,691
I'M JUST GOING TO RUN DOWN TO THE VENDING MACHINES.

520
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,193
OH. ALL RIGHT.

521
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,702

COME ON, YOU GUYS.

524
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,208
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

525
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,210
I THOUGHT WE WERE THE PATCH SISTERS.

526
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,711
YEAH. THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

527
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,214
WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT ABOUT ALL WE TALKED ABOUT?

528
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,216
YOU KNOW, THE DISGUSTING PLACE.

529
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,717
THE UGLY PEOPLE.

530
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,222
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

531
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:29,228
RACHEL, WE TRIED TO QUIT, BUT IT WAS TOO HARD.

532
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,230
WELL, YOU KNOW, IF YOU STARTED SMOKING AGAIN

533
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,731
YOU COULD HAVE AT LEAST TOLD ME.

534
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,233
COME ON. GIVE ME ONE OF THOSE.

535
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,734
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

536
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,736
NO, NO. YOU'RE DOING GREAT. DON'T YOU GIVE UP.

537
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,238
THAT'S WHY WE DIDN'T TELL YOU

538
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,739
AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO DRAG YOU DOWN WITH US.

539
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,741
WAIT. NO, NO, NO. DRAG ME DOWN. DRAG DRAG ME DOWN.

540
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,243
FORGET IT, RACHEL.

541
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,245
WE'RE BOTH SO PROUD OF HOW WELL YOU'RE DOING.

542
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,746
I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU BLOW IT.

543
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,249
IN FACT, IF I CATCH YOU WITH A CIGARETTE, YOU'RE FIRED.

544
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,751
GO ON. I DON'T WANT YOU BREATHING THIS STUFF. GO ON.

545
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,253
ALL RIGHT.

546
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,755
SO YOU'LL COME WITH  ME ON THE PARIS TRIP?

547
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,257
OH, MAN!

00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,770
THE CUP.

553
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,272
GREAT JOB WITH THE CUPS, PHEEBS.

554
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,773

555
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,776
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO OUT WITH HER?

556
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,278
AND DID YOU NOTICE THE ICE?

557
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,280
LOOK, WE HAVE IT ALL--

558
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,283
WE HAVE CRUSHED, CUBED AND DRY.

559
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,286
WATCH.

560
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,787
AHH... MYSTICAL.

561
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,289
OH, YES.

562
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,291
CHANDLER...

563
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,792
IF IT WEREN'T...

564
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,294
NO ONE'S EATING MY TUSCAN FINGER FOOD

565
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,796
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL FILLING UP ON PHOEBE'S SNO CONES.

566
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,298
THERE ARE SNO CONES?

567
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,300
SNO CONES?

568
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,301
YECH!

569
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,802
YOU KNOW, GO, GO.

570
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,803
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

571
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,307
PHOEBE.

572
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,308
HMM?

573
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,311
YOU REALLY DID DO A NICE JOB.

574
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,314
THANK YOU FOR STATING THE OBVIOUS.

575
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,316
I DESERVE THAT.

576
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,318
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT

577
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,820
IF WE EVER COHOST A PARTY TOGETHER AGAIN

578
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,322
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

579
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,324
YOU KNOW, JOEY'S GOT A BIRTHDAY COMING UP.

580
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,326
REALLY? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

581
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,828
OKAY, I'D LIKE TO BE IN CHARGE OF BEER.

582
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,831
WELL, THEN THERE'S NOTHING LEFT FOR ME.

583
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,833
 OH, LOOK, LOOK!

584
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,336
 SURPRISE!

585
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,837
WHAT?!

586
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,340
MY BIRTHDAY IS NOT FOR ANOTHER MONTH.

587
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,842
THAT'S THE SURPRISE.

588
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,344
OH, MY GOD.

589
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,346
YOU GUYS, THIS IS SO GREAT.

590
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,348
IT'S SO UNEXPECTED.

591
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,851
I MEAN, CHANDLER'S BIRTHDAY'S EVEN BEFORE MINE.

592
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,356
SURPRISE.

593
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,361
WOW! THIS IS SO GREAT.

594
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,364
LOOK AT ALL THESE... CUPS.

595
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,866
THIS IS SO WEIRD.

596
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,868
I WAS IN CHARGE OF CUPS.

597
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:53,372
OH, OKAY. NOT SO WEIRD.

598
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,874
CHANDLER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

599
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,376
NOTHING.

600
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,378
WHAT'S IN YOUR HAND?

601
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,880
MONEY. I'M STEALING ALL THE MONEY.

602
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,383
CHANDLER...

603
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:08,887
OKAY, BUT JUST ONE, OKAY?

604
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,390
BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS WHEN MY BIRTHDAY IS.

605
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,892
LET ME MAKE THIS CLEAR TO YOU, OKAY?

606
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,395
IT'S EITHER THAT OR THIS.

607
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,404
IS THERE A MENTHOL?

608
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,910
HEY.

609
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,413
HEY.

610
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,915
LISTEN, MAN, UH... I'M SORRY THE AUDITION DIDN'T GO WELL.

611
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,417
YEAH, RIGHT.

612
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,919
NO, REALLY, I AM, JOEY.

613
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,920
I FEEL BAD.

614
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,922
YEAH, WELL , LOOK, ROSS...

615
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,924
YOU DON'T HAVE TO, OKAY.

616
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,926
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT I SUCK.

617
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:53,932
I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF ACTOR CAN'T EVEN SAY, "MMM! NOODLE SOUP"?

618
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,934
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

619
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,937
MAYBE... MAYBE YOU DIDN'T MESS UP

620
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,440
THE AUDITION BECAUSE YOU SUCK.

621
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,445
MAYBE YOU MESSED UP BECAUSE YOU CARE MORE ABOUT YOUR GODSON.

622
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,946
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

623
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,449
I THINK, SUBCONSCIOUSLY...

624
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,951
WHOA. YOU LOST ME.

625
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,457
I THINK, ON SOME LEVEL

626
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,460
YOU YOU SABOTAGED YOUR OWN AUDITION

627
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,463
SO BEN WOULD GET THE PAID.

628
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:30,469
WELL, YOUR WAY SOUNDS A LOT BETTER THAN MINE.

629
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:34,473
YEAH. YEAH. IT'S NOT THAT I'M A BAD ACTOR...

630
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,475
NO.

631
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,978
NO, IT'S JUST THAT, UH, I CARE SO DAMN MUCH ABOUT LITTLE BEN

632
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,981
THAT, UH, IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT FOR ME TO SEE HIM SUCCEED.

633
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:43,982
THERE YOU GO. YEAH.

634
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,484
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

635
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,486
SO, DID HE GET IT? NO.

636
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,987
AW, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

637
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,994
OH, HI. EXCUSE ME. IS RACHEL GREEN HERE?

638
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,496
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET HER FOR LUNCH.

639
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,498
SHE DOESN'T COME DOWN HERE ANYMORE.

640
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,999
YOU CAN FIND HER UP ON TEN.

641
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,001
OKAY, GREAT.

642
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,003
WE TALKED ABOUT THE WHOLE PRESENTATION

643
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,505
YESTERDAY AT LUNCH.

644
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,006
HE WONDERED IF ONE PERSON

645
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,007
WOULD BE ENOUGH TO TAKE ON THE TRIP

646
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,509
AND I SAID, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

647
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,517
I'LL CATCH YOU GUYS LATER.
