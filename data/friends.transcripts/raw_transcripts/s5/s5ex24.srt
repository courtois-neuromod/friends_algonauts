553
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,833
DID YOU GUYS MAKE UP?

554
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,834
NO.

555
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,836
BUT SHE JUST CAME UP HERE.

556
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,339
THAT WAS JOEY.

557
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,340
I WONDER WHERE SHE IS.

558
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,841
THAT'S SO WEIRD.

559
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,344
YEAH, WELL, SHE'S PROBABLY TALKING TO RICHARD.

560
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,845
WOULD YOU STOP THAT?

561
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,847
YOU WANT TO KNOW THE FIRST THING SHE SAID

562
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,849
WHEN SHE CAME BACK FROM HER LUNCH WITH RICHARD?

563
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,351
SHE DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING FOR HIM.

564
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,852
SHE LOVES YOU.

565
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,354
REALLY?

566
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,855
YES.

567
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,856
SHE FEELS TERRIBLE.

568
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,858
SHE REALLY WANTS TO MAKE UP.

569
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,360
YOU'VE GOT TO FIND HER.

570
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,862
OKAY.

571
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,364
GOOD.

572
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:56,875
I SHOULD REALLY START WEARING HATS.

573
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:02,381
?? IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO BE LOVED BY ANYONE ??

574
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,882
?? IT'S NOT UNUSUAL... ??

575
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,884
YAY!

576
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,386
??
?? ...TO HAVE FUN WITH ANYONE

577
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,389
?? BUT WHEN I SEE YOU HANGING ABOUT WITH ANYONE ??

578
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,391
WHERE ARE THE DICE?

579
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:17,396
?? IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO SEE ME CRY ??

580
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,399
?? I WANT TO DIE... ??

581
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,922
WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS.

582
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,924
DID YOU ENJOY YOUR FLIGHT?

583
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,426
YES, I DID.

584
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,927
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

585
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,429
IT WAS EXCELLENT.

586
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,431
HOPE YOU HAD A NICE FLIGHT.

587
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,933
OH, IT WAS THE BEST.

588
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,440
I THINK THE CHECK IN IS THAT WAY.

589
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,441
AH.

590
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,942

591
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:04,943

592
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,945
HELLO!

597
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,455
YAY!

598
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,957
WHAT'D YOU DO, GO TO A COSTUME PARTY?

599
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,959
OH, BOY. LET ME GUESS.

600
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,461
UM, PANCHO VILLA.

601
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,463

602
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,465
AND YOU'RE BOB SAGET.

603
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,968
"PANCHO VILLA"?

604
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:30,969
YEAH.

605
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,472
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, PHEEBS? I DON'T...

606
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,476

607
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,977
OH, MY GOD!

608
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,479

609
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,481
HEY, YOU WET MY PANTS!

00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,482
HEY...

611
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,484
WHOA, WHAT KIND OF PARTY WAS THIS?

612
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,487
ROSS, I HAVE BEEN WALKING AROUND LIKE THIS SINCE THE PLANE?

613
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,988
I HAVE... YOU HAVE SO CROSSED A LINE.

614
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:50,989
RACH, WAIT.

615
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,492
THE MEN'S ROOM IS THAT WAY.

616
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,496

617
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,997
OH!

618
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,499
WHAT?

619
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,501
THAT'S, LIKE, THE THIRD TIME THAT LADY'S WON

620
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,502
ON A MACHINE I WAS PLAYING.

621
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,505
OH, I'LL BET SHE'S ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.

622
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,508
M M MOLE PEOPLE?

623
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,510
WHAT? NO. NO, A LURKER.

624
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,011
OH. WHAT'S A LURKER?

625
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,013
OKAY, WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING A MACHINE

626
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,515
AND IT HASN'T PAID OUT

627
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,017
A LURKER WAITS FOR YOU TO GIVE UP AND THEN...

628
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,519
KILLS YOU?

629
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:25,023
NO, THEY SWOOP IN AND STEAL YOUR JACKPOT.

630
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,525
OH. MM HMM.

631
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,026
HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

632
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,028
MY NANA USED TO DO IT, MM HMM.

633
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,531
THAT'S HOW SHE PAID FOR ALL MY DANCE...

634
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,532
KARATE LESSONS.

635
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,034
DANCE KARATE?

636
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:39,538
YES. IT'S A DEADLY BUT BEAUTIFUL SPORT.

637
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,543
OKAY

638
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,044
IT WON'T COME OFF.

639
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,045
WHAT?!

640
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,046
IT WON'T COME OFF!

641
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,047
OH, MY GOD.

642
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,549
RACH, A ARE YOU SURE?

643
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,552
NO. ACTUALLY, I TOOK IT OFF, AND THEN I DREW IT BACK ON.

644
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,555
RACH, I AM SORRY. I AM SO SOR...

645
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,557
I'M SURE WE CAN GET IT OFF, OKAY?

646
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,558
JUST GIVE ME YOUR PEN.

647
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,560
WHAT? WHY? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH IT?

648
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,562
WELL, I BELIEVE I'M GOING TO STAB YOU REPEATEDLY.

649
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,564
NOT NOT HERE.

650
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,567
THERE ARE CAME RAS EVERYWHERE.

651
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,569
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY! YOU MADE IT!

652
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,070
JOEY! HEY, HEY!

653
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,071
HI.

654
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,073
WHO'S YOUR FRIEND? HE'S HOT.

655
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,074

656
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,075
THANKS, MAN.

657
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,078
HEY, LISTEN, UH, I TALKED TO CHANDLER.

658
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,080
I I'M SORRY ABOUT THE MOVIE.

659
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,081
OH, DON'T BE SORRY.

660
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,583
I DON'T NEED IT ANYMORE.

661
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,585
I FOUND MY IDENTICAL HAND TWIN.

662
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,587
YOUR WHAT?

663
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,588
MY IDENTICAL HAND TWIN.

664
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,090
YEAH, THE PERSON WHOSE HANDS ARE EXACTLY LIKE MINE.

665
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,592
WERE YOU LOOKING FOR THIS PERSON?

666
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,093
NOT EVEN!

667
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,095
THIS THING IS A GOLD MINE.

668
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,096
WHAT?!

669
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,098
WHA...? HOW...?

670
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,100
THAT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE YOU ANY MONEY.

671
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,603
OKAY. WELL, IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT, FINE.

672
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,605
NONE OF YOU ARE GOING TO GET TO LIVE WITH ME

673
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,606
IN MY GREAT BIG

674
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,107
HAND SHAPED MANSION.

675
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,108
'CEPT, UH, YOU, PHEEBS.

676
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,610
YOU CAN LIVE IN THE THUMB.

677
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,615
ALL RIGHT, BABY, COME ON!

678
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,116
YES! YES! YES!

679
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,117
I AM ON FIRE!

680
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,619
SEE YOU LATER, MON.

681
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,621
BUT, CHANDLER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

682
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,623
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE? I'M GOING HOME.

683
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,124
WAIT. WHY?

684
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,126
CHANDLER?

685
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,628
CHANDLER, WAIT.

686
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:10,629
I'M SORRY.

687
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,631
I WAS JUST PLAYING FOR ONE SECOND.

688
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,633
I WAS TRYING TO FIND YOU AND TELL YOU THAT...

689
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,135
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO SEE RICHARD AGAIN, I WON'T.

690
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,136
HE HE MEANS NOTHING TO ME.

691
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,638
OH, COME ON.

692
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,139
I WAS THERE.

693
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,143
I KNOW HE'S THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.

694
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,646
NOT ANYMORE.

695
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,148
REALLY?

696
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,150
REALLY.

697
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,155
ALL RIGHT?

698
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,658
LET'S FORGET ABOUT THIS "GOING HOME" STUFF

699
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,159
AND START CELEBRATING OUR ANNIVERSARY.

700
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,663
OKAY, THIS IS EMPTY.

701
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,165
YEAH, I I WANTED TO MAKE A DRAMATIC SCENE

702
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,667
BUT I HATE PACKING.

703
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,168

704
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,175
UH, HEY, WHERE'S THE OTHER GUY?

705
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,677
WHICH GUY?

706
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,178
HE'S KIND OF TALL, DARK HAIR

707
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,680
HAND LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THIS, SEE?

708
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,181
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE HANDS

709
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,683
BUT THE GUY WHO WAS HERE BEFORE ME

710
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,184
JUST WENT TO THE RESTROOM.

711
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,185
OKAY.

712
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,693
HOW YOU DOING?

713
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,194
VERY BUSY.

714
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,696
ALL RIGHT! OKAY!

715
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,203
YES, HELLO, I HAVE A QUESTION.

716
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:30,208
UM, I USED YOUR PEN TO DRAW ON MY FRIEND'S FACE.

717
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,711
A BEARD AND A MUSTACHE.

718
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,713

719
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,715
THANK YOU.

720
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,219
NO, SHE DIDN'T THINK SO.

721
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,220
I KNOW. IT'S, LIKE...

722
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,221
ANYWAY, UM...

723
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,225
MAKEUP DIDN'T COVER IT AND WE'VE TRIED EVERYTHING

724
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,728
TO GET IT OFF AND NOTHING'S WORKED

725
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,229
WHAT DO WE DO?

726
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,731
YEAH.

727
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:56,234
UH HUH... YEAH.

728
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,736
OH, OKAY.

729
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,737
OKAY, THANK YOU.

730
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,740
YEAH, IT'S NOT COMING OFF.

731
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,241
WHAT?

732
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,743
WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY?

733
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,246
UM, HE SAID HE THOUGHT I WAS FUNNY, SO...

734
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:14,252
OKAY, LOOK, LOOK, LET'S JUST GO DOWNSTAIRS, WE'LL HAVE SOME FUN

735
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,755
AND YOU WILL FORGET ALL ABOUT IT.

736
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,256
ROSS, NO!

737
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,759
THERE IS NO WAY I AM LEAVING THIS ROOM LOOKING LIKE THIS.
