1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,004
HEY. HEY.

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,506
WOW. YOU LOOK NICE; WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,509
MONICA AND I ARE CELEBRATING OUR TEN MONTH ANNIVERSARY.

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,511
GOT RESERVATIONS AT JEAN GEORGES.

5
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,013
WOW. HOW'D YOU GET IN THERE?

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,015
OH, MADE A FEW CALLS, PULLED SOME STRINGS

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,017
AND THEY AGREED TO SEAT US AT 11:30

8
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,519
IF WE BOTH HAD THE CHICKEN AND DIDN'T GET DESSERT.

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,520
I SEE.

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,521

11
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,023
HI, CHANDLER.

12
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,524
HEY, CAITLIN.

13
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,026
SOMEBODY GOT A HAIRCUT.

14
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,027
UGH. I HATE IT.

15
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,528
I LOOK LIKE AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY.

16
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,030
YEAH, WELL, IF THAT WAS TRUE

17
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,032
GYM CLASS WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE INTERESTING.

18
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,033

19
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,535
IT'S, UH, $27 EVEN.

20
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,037
OH, OKAY.

21
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,538

22
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,540
HEY, WHERE'S YOUR CHICKEN?

23
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,042
OH, HE'S IN THE BACK.

24
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,045
THE DUCK PISSED HIM OFF-- SAID THAT EGGS CAME FIRST.

25
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,546
THANKS. I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

26
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:47,547
OKAY, BYE.

27
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,553
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

28
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,554
WHAT?

29
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,056
THE FLIRTING.

30
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,058
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE GOING OUT WITH--

31
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,559
UH, I DON'T KNOW-- MY SISTER?

32
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,561
I WAS NOT FLIRTING.

33
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,064
IT WAS TOTALLY FLIRTING.

34
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,565
"SOMEBODY GOT A HAIRCUT."

35
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,566

36
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,070
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, THE IMPRESSION? UNCANNY.

37
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,072
AND, SECOND, THAT WAS NOT FLIRTING.

38
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,074
THAT WAS JUST CASUAL CONVERSATION

39
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,076
BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE; THAT IS ALL.

40
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,577
YEAH, RIGHT.

41
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,080
YOU WANT TO SEE FLIRTING? I'LL SHOW YOU FLIRTING.

42
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,582
I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD.

55
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,133
I AM SO PROUD OF JOEY.

56
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,635
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO BE ONLAW & ORDER.

57
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,637
I KNOW, BUT DON'T YOU THINK

58
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,639
THAT IT SHOULD BE CALLED ORDER & LAW?

59
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,142
NO, BECAUSE FIRST THEY ARREST THE GUY, AND THEN THEY TRY HIM.

60
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,144
YEAH, DON'T GET  ME STARTED ON THAT.

61
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,646
I WAS NOT FLIRTING.

62
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,149
AND ON YOUR ANNIVERSARY-- FOR SHAME.

63
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,651
 WHAT'S GOING ON?

64
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,153
CHANDLER WAS HITTING ON THE HOT DELIVERY GIRL.

65
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:37,157
I WAS NOT AND, OH, GOD, SHH!

66
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,658
WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT YOU WERE, OKAY?

67
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,161
AND BESIDES, IF ANYONE SHOULD BE HITTING ON HER

68
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,662
IT'S THE GUY WHO'S SINGLE, OKAY?

69
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,664
THE GUY WHO CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

70
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,168
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE WANTS TO BEMR. PIZZA DELIVERY GIRL.

71
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,170
WELL...

72
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,671
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

73
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,174
YOU LIKE CAITLIN?

74
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,177
ROSS, WE BROKE  UP TWO YEARS AGO.

75
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,179
YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED SINCE THEN.

76
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,182
I THINK IT'S OKAY THAT WE SEE OTHER PEOPLE.

77
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,685
WELL, I WAS WATCHING HER THE OTHER DAY

78
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,688
AT THE PIZZA PLACE, AND SHE WAS JUST SO SEXY

79
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,691
AND FUNNY AND HAS THE CUTEST LITTLE...

80
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,194
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

81
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,695
WE DON'T NEED HER MEASUREMENTS.

82
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,197
OKAY, PEPPERONI, PEPPERONI, PEPPERONI.

83
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,200
ROSS, I KNOW SHE'S PRETTY AND YOU LOVE HER

84
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,701
BUT IS SHE STUPID?

85
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,703
SHE FORGOT MY VEGETARIAN.

86
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,205
THIS IS PERFECT.

87
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,208
SHE'LL HAVE TO COME BACK HERE WITH YOUR PIZZA

88
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:33,213
AND WHEN SHE DOES, I WILL TURN ON THE CHARM O'-ROSS.

89
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,216
OH, I AM SO GLAD YOU DON'T EAT MEAT.

90
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,719
SEE? VEGETARIANISM BENEFITS EVERYONE.

91
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,721
HEY, EVERYBODY, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

92
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,223
YOU REMEMBER MY GRANDMOTHER?

93
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,224
 HI!

94
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,225
BIG NIGHT.

95
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,226
YEAH, IT'S SO COOL.

96
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,728
SO, JOEY ONLAW AND ORDER-- YOU MUST BE VERY PROUD.

97
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,731
CHANDLER, SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD OF ENGLISH.

98
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,234
I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT YOU WERE JOEY'S OTHER GRANDMOTHER.

99
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,238
I'VE DONE IT AGAIN.

100
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,240
NO, NONNI-- NONNI'S MY BIGGEST FAN.

101
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,742
YEAH, SHE'S THE ONLY ONE IN THE FAMILY

102
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,744
WHO'S ALWAYS BELIEVED IN ME.

103
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,745
SI, NONNI?

104
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,247
IO SONO NUMERON UNO, NO?

105
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,749
SI,BIG STAR.

106
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,752
MY BIG FAT JOEY STAR.

107
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,256

108
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,759
YEAH, I WEIGHED, LIKE, 27 POUNDS WHEN I WAS BORN.

109
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,264
HEY, HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

110
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:28,268
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, TEN MONTHS.

111
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,769
SO, UM, WHEN I WAS IN THE SHOWER

112
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,272
I WAS THINKING ABOUT OUR FIRST NIGHT IN LONDON.

113
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,274
OH, JOEY'S GRANDMOTHER'S RIGHT THERE.

114
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,776
IS THAT THE ONE WHO SPEAKS ENGLISH OR THE ONE WHO DOESN'T?

115
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,778
THE ONE WHO DOESN'T. THAT WAS SOME HOT LOVE YOU GAVE ME.

116
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,280
I'M GOING TO GO GET READY.

117
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,283
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU WEAR THOSE EARRINGS I GOT YOU?

118
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,784
OH, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

119
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,786
I WAS SAVING THEM FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL. OKAY.

120
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,290
YOU'VE GOT TO GO HOME.

121
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,292
BUT I LIKE IT HERE.

122
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,294
YOU GOT TO GO HOME AND GET THE EARRINGS

123
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,295
YOU BORROWED FROM ME, OKAY?

124
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,796
CHANDLER WANTS ME TO WEAR THEM TONIGHT.

125
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,798
OKAY. I THINK THEY'RE IN MY PURSE.

126
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,300
GOT GET DRESSED AND I'LL LOOK FOR THEM.

127
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,801
GREAT. OKAY.

128
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,804
RACH, HI.

129
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,806
I NEED THOSE EARRINGS YOU BORROWED.

130
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,310
OH, UM... OKAY.

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,811
YEAH. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

132
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,812
OKAY.

133
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,317
SCUSA, SIGNORA.

134
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,319

135
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,320
NIENTE, GRAZIE.

136
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,821

137
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,822

138
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,824
WOW, PHEEBS, YOU SPEAK ITALIAN?

139
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,326
I GUESS SO.

140
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,330
THERE YOU GO.

141
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,831
THANK YOU. WAIT, RACH.

142
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,832
WHERE'S THE OTHER ONE?

143
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,335
OH, WHAT? YOU WANT BOTH OF THEM?

144
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,338
GETTING A LITTLE GREEDY, DON'T YOU THINK?

145
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,341
RACHEL KAREN GREEN, WHERE IS THE OTHER EARRING?

146
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,343
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, LOOK, JUST DON'T FREAK OUT

147
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,344
BUT I KIND OF LOST IT.

148
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,845
I KNOW IT'S IN THE APARTMENT

149
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,348
BUT I DEFINITELY LOST IT.

150
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,849
WHAT AM I GOING TO TELL MONICA?

151
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,851
SHE WANTS TO WEAR THEM TONIGHT.

152
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,852
I DON'T KNOW.

153
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,354
TELL HER TO WEAR HER OWN EARRINGS.

154
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,355
THESE ARE HER EARRINGS.

155
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,357
NO, NO!

156
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,359
YOU LENT ME MONICA'S EARRINGS?!

157
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,861
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO BORROW HER STUFF!

158
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,863
WHY NOT?

159
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,365
BECAUSE I LOSE HER STUFF!

160
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,373
He left a little after 2:00.

161
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,375
OKAY, NOW, YOU SEE THAT BLIND GUY RIGHT THERE?

162
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,377
I'M GOING TO BASH HIS HEAD IN LATER.

163
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,879
DOV'E, JOEY? DOV'E, JOEY?

164
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,881
MY BIG SCENE'S COMING UP.

165
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,383
THE BIG SCENE COMING UP.

166
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,385
IF YOU SAID, "BIG LIMA BEAN BUBBLING UP"

167
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,387
WOULD SHE UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE?

168
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,891
RACH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

169
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,893
OH, I I JUST CAN'T WATCH.

170
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,395
IT'S TOO SCARY.

171
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,897
IT'S A DIAPER COMMERCIAL.

172
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,901
OH, YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW ME AND BABIES... RESPONSIBILITIES.

173
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,902

174
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,405

175
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,906

176
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:47,907

177
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,908
I WILL GET THAT!

178
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,912
HOW DOES MY HAIR LOOK?

179
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,416
ROSS, IT HASN'T MOVED SINCE 1996.

180
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,421
HEY. HI.

00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,426
OH. UH, BY THE WAY

00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,428

185
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,431
I HAPPEN TO LIKE EIGHT YEAR OLD BOYS.

186
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,436
WHAT?

187
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,438

OH. THANKS.

194
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,956
YOU UNDERSTAND

195
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,459
I DON'T ACTUALLY LIKE EIGHT YEAR OLD BOYS...

196
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,963
YOU KNOW, ALL I'M LOOKING FOR IS THE MONEY.

197
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:44,964
HERE YOU GO.

198
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,466
NOW, STOP BRINGING US PIZZAS, YOU.

199
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,468
I'M GOING TO TRY.

200
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,469
BYE.

201
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,971

202
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,972
YOU'RE WELCOME.

203
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,474
YOU COULDN'T LET ME HAVE HER, COULD YOU?

204
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,476
WHAT?

205
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,478
THIS IS A GIRL I REALLY LIKE

206
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,980
AND YOU, YOU HAD TO SWOOP IN THERE!

207
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,981
WHAT'S GOING ON?

208
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,483
CHANDLER WAS TOTALLY FLIRTING

209
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,984
WITH THE HOT DELIVERY GIRL.

210
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,987
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

211
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,491
I WAS NOT FLIRTING.

212
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,492
IT'S OKAY. I DON'T CARE.

213
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,493
IT'S FINE.

214
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,995
REALLY? REALLY?

215
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:16,996
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

216
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,997
I DO IT ALL THE TIME.

217
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:18,998

218
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,000
SO, UH...

219
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,001

220
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,504
YOU YOU YOU FLIRT WITH GUYS ALL THE TIME?

221
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,506
SURE. IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

222
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,509
JUST LIKE I KNOW IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING WITH YOU.

223
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,510
OKAY, BUT THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.

224
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,011
YOU ARE A LOT HOTTER THAN I AM.

225
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,012
TRUE STORY.

226
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,014
CHANDLER, THIS ACTUALLY BOTHERS YOU?

227
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,015
YES, IT DOES BOTHER ME.

228
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,017
I THINK IT'D BOTHER A LOT OF PEOPLE.

229
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,520
RACHEL, WHEN YOU WERE GOING OUT WITH ROSS

230
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,022
DID IT BOTHER YOU WHEN HE FLIRTED WITH OTHER WOMEN?

231
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,024
UH, NO. NO, IT BOTHERED ME

232
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,027
WHEN HE SLEPT WITH OTHER WOMEN.

233
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,533
AND THANK YOU FOR THAT.

234
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,034
BUT, YOU KNOW, I NEVER REALLY HAD

235
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,536
ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

236
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,038
ROSS WAS NEVER VERY GOOD AT THE FLIRTING THING.

237
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,541
WHA WHA...?

238
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,543
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

239
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,044
IT WORKED WITH YOU.

240
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,045
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

241
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,547
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

242
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,549
WE MET, YOU FLIRTED AND THEN, BAM!

243
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,551
NINE YEARS LATER, YOU HAD ME.

244
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,553
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

245
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,555
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO?

246
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,557
I AM GOING TO ORDER ANOTHER PIZZA.

247
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,058
AND WHEN CAITLIN GETS HERE

248
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,060
I WILL SHOW YOU HOW WELL I FLIRT.

249
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,562
IN FACT, I WILL...

250
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,564
RIGHT. I WILL GET HER PHONE NUMBER--

251
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,067
AND NOT THE ONE ON THE MENU.

252
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,070
I FOUND IT.

253
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,572
OH, THANK GOD! WHERE WAS IT?

254
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,073
ON YOUR DRESSER.

255
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,576
OKAY, THAT IS THE ONE WE ALREADY HAVE.

256
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,577
OH!

257
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,078
OKAY, HERE'S MY BIG SCENE.

258
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,079
MY BIG SCENE'S HERE.

259
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,582
What do you bet, nobody heard anything?

260
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,083
No bet.

261
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,586
Anybody home?

262
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,587
OH, MY GOD.

263
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:48,588
WHAT?

264
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,590
OKAY, EVERYBODY JUST KEEP SMILING.

265
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,092
IT'LL KILL MY GRANDMOTHER IF SHE FINDS OUT.

266
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,594
WHAT IS IT?

267
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,096
THEY CUT ME OUT OF THE SHOW.

268
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,097
WHAT?

269
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,599
ARE YOU SURE?

270
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,100
MAYBE YOUR SCENE'S COMING UP.

271
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,101
NOT LIKELY

272
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,604
BECAUSE YOU SEE THAT BODY BAG RIGHT THERE?

273
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,606
YEAH. I'M IN IT.

274
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,108
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

275
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,109
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

276
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,611
I DON'T KNOW.

277
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,613
THIS LITTLE OLD LADY LIVES FOR MY CAREER.

278
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,616
WHEN THEY DUMPED ME OFF DAYS OF OUR LIVES,SHE ALMOST DIED.

279
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,117
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

280
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,119
NO. WE HAD TO GET HER A HOME NURSE.

281
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,621
OH, MY GOD.

282
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,623
SHE ALMOST DIED, AND GOT REALLY EXPENSIVE.

283
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,126
YOU'RE NOT SMILING. NOT THAT FACE.

284
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,628
SMILE. EVERYBODY SMILE!

285
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,130
JOEY, WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL HER WHAT HAPPENED?

286
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,132
I MEAN, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

287
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,634
IF WE KEEP TALKING THIS WAY

288
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,636
AREN'T WE GOING TO FREAK HER OUT SOON?

289
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,638

290
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,139
OH, UH, UH, SOON. SOON.

291
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,141
I'M GOING TO BE ON SOON.

292
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,142
I... THERE I AM!

293
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,644
I'll let you know.

294
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,145
 NO!

295
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,147
SAM WATERSTON.

296
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,650
NO, NO, NO. THAT'S... THAT'S ME. THAT'S ME.

297
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,152
NO. SAM WATERSTON.

298
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,155
CRIME MISDEMEANOR, CAPRICORN ONE...

299
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,157
SHE DOESN'T KNOW "HELLO"

300
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,159
BUT SHE KNOWS CAPRICORN ONE.

301
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,160
PHOEBE? HMM?

302
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,662
I HAVE TO HAVE THOSE EARRINGS.

303
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,163
WE'RE LEAVING AS SOON AS THE SHOW'S OVER.

304
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,666
BUT I ALREADY GAVE THEM BACK TO YOU.

305
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,670
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

306
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,673
ALL RIGHT, I ALREADY DIDN'T GAVE THEM BACK TO YOU.

307
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,675
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

308
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,176
RACHEL, WHERE IS THAT OTHER EARRING?

309
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,679
IT'S NOT HERE, PHEEBS. IT'S NOT HERE.

310
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,680
OH! I WENT TO JOEY

311
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,181
AND CHANDLER'S LAST NIGHT.

312
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,184
OKAY. MAKE SURE YOU CHECK CHANDLER'S JEWELRY BOX.

313
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,186
WAIT A MINUTE.

314
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,188
WHAT? CHANDLER HAS A JEWELRY BOX?

315
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,190
OKAY, WE HAVE, LIKE, TEN MINUTES.

316
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,192
DO YOU WANT ME TO GET INTO THAT NOW?

317
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,699
HEY, PHEEBS.

318
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,701
HOW'S THAT, UH...

319
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,204
VEGETARIAN PIZZA WORKING OUT FOR YOU, HUH?

320
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,208
YOU AND THOSE VEGETABLES

321
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:53,212
HAVE A REAL THING GOING ON, HUH?

322
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,715
WHY ARE YOU BEING WEIRD?

323
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,219
DO YOU LIKE IT?

324
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,723
NO. THAT WOULD BE, "WHY ARE YOU BEING CUTE?"

325
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,226
OKAY, I'M WORKING ON MY FLIRTING.

326
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,729
OH! I DID NOT GET THAT.

327
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,733
SO, MONICA, DO YOU... DO YOU LIKE THE LAW & ORDER?

328
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,234
YEAH. IT'S GOOD.

329
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,737
SEE, I'M FINDING OUT ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT YOU TODAY--

330
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,738
LIKE YOU LIKE THE LAW & ORDER

331
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,240
AND AND YOU FLIRTED WITH EVERY GUY IN THE TRISTATE AREA.

332
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,742
SHH! SHH!

333
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,743
ALL RIGHT.

334
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,745
OKAY, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

335
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,748
IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO FLIRT, BUT NOT FOR ME.

336
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,250
OH, I'M SO GLAD WE CLEARED THAT UP.

337
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,252
LOOK, I'M SORRY

338
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,754
BUT SOME THINGS ARE DIFFERENT

339
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,255
FOR MEN AND FOR WOMEN.

340
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,257
GO ON, TEACH ME SOMETHING ABOUT MEN AND WOMEN.

341
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,260
OKAY, I'VE ALREADY TAUGHT YOU SO MUCH ALREADY, BUT WHATEVER...

342
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,762
SEE, WHEN YOU FLIRT WITH A GUY

343
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,264
YOU THINK, "I'M JUST FLIRTING. NO BIG DEAL."

344
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,265
BUT THE GUY IS THINKING

345
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,768
"FINALLY, SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO SLEEP WITH ME."

346
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,269
NO WAY!

347
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,270
IT'S TRUE.

348
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,271
THAT'S PATHETIC.

349
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,273
AGAIN, TRUE.

350
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,275
AND THIS GOES FOR ALL GUYS?

351
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,777
ALL GUYS THAT ARE AWAKE.

352
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,278
THEN WE GO TO SLEEP.

353
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,781
THEN ALL GUYS FROM THE OTHER END OF THE WORLD WAKE UP

354
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,783
AND BEHAVE THE EXACT SAME WAY.

355
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,286
ALL RIGHT, IT'S ANOTHER COMMERCIAL

356
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,788
AND I STILL HAVEN'T TOLD HER.

357
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,290
JOEY, THIS IS, LIKE, THE LAST COMMERCIAL.

358
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,792
YOU GOT, LIKE, TEN MINUTES LEFT.

359
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,793
I KNOW, I KNOW.

360
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,295
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? OH!

361
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,798
NO, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO RUN OUT

362
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,800
AND LEAVE HER HERE.

363
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,802
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

364
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,803
OH!

365
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,307
JOEY?

366
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,810
UH... JOEY'S GOING TO BE RIGHT BACK.

367
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,812
RIGHT... BACK.

368
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,313

369
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,816
MEANWHILE, LET'S, LET'S, LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU.

370
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,818
SO...

371
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,820
YOU'RE OLD AND SMALL.

372
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,328
DID YOU FIND IT?

373
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,830
THE EARRING? NO. BUT, LOOK--

374
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,331
I FOUND MY SUNGLASSES UNDER THE COUCH.

375
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,834
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THESE SINCE, LIKE, LAST SUMMER.

376
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,335
OKAY, THOSE ARE MY SUNGLASSES.

377
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:57,837
YOU BORROWED THEM FROM ME.

378
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,339
ALL RIGHT. OKAY. CALM DOWN.

379
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,841
HERE THEY ARE.

380
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,343
PHOEBE?

381
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,346
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

382
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,848
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.

383
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:09,849
ALL RIGHT. WELL...

384
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,350
WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE

385
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,352
TO TELL MONICA, THAT'S ALL.

386
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,354
OH, GOD, SHE'S GOING TO KILL ME.

387
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,856
I SUPPOSE I COULD TELL HER

388
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,858
IT WAS JUST ALL MY FAULT.

389
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,359
OH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

390
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,864
MON, CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SEC?

391
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,365
YEAH. WHAT IS IT?

392
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,869
UM... I LOST ONE OF YOUR EARRINGS.

393
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,872
I'M SORRY. I AM SO, SO SORRY.

394
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,373
WOW...

395
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,875
ALL RIGHT.

396
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,377
WELL, I MEAN, WHAT CAN YOU DO?

397
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,379
IF YOU LOST IT, YOU LOST IT.

398
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,881
I'LL REPLACE IT, I PROMISE.

399
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,382
I FEEL SO TERRIBLE.

400
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,384
YOU DIDN'T DO IT ON PURPOSE.

401
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,385
NO.

402
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,887
LOOK AT YOU. COME HERE.

403
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,889
AW...

404
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,891
IS THAT BETTER?

405
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,893
YEAH. YOU'RE THE BEST.

406
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,395
OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE.

407
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,897
WAIT A MINUTE.

408
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,398
I I I... I CAN'T DO THIS.

409
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,900
LISTEN, HONEY, THIS IS...

410
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,401
IT'S NOT PHOEBE'S FAULT.

411
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,403
SHE LENT ME THE EARRINGS.

412
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,405
I LOST IT.  I'M SO SORRY, HONEY.

413
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,907
I FEEL TERRIBLE, TOO.

414
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,911
THAT IS EXACTLY WHY I DO NOT LEND YOU STUFF!

415
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,914
OKAY? I MEAN, FIRST, IT'S MY JEWELRY!

416
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,916
IF IT'S NOT MY JEWELRY, IT'S MY BLUE SWEATER!

417
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,418
IF IT'S NOT MY BLUE SWEATER, IT'S MY SUNGLASSES!

418
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,920
YOUR SUNGLASSES?

419
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,921
YES!

420
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,422
OH, RIGHT.

421
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,924

422
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:25,925
PIZZA!

PREPARE YOURSELVES FOR SOME CLASS "A" FLIRTING.

426

OKAY, HOLD ON.

427
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,436
OKAY.

428
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,938
ROSS, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO PROVE.

429
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,439
AND IF YOU REALLY LIKE THIS GIRL

430
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,942
I DON'T THINK FLIRTING'S THE RIGHT WAY TO...

431
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:43,943
UH! UH! UH! UH! UH!

432
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,445
YOU'LL SEE.

433
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,947
OKAY.

434
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,451
WH WHAT'S HER NAME? WHAT'S...?

435
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,452

00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,955
CAITLIN.

437
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,961

438
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,962
HEY!

439
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,965
OH, WE... WE CAN'T KEEP EATING LIKE THIS.

440
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,469
IT'S, UH.... $12.50.

441
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,972
OKAY. UM...

442
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,473

IN ONE OF THOSE, UH... WOOD BURNING OVENS?

445
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,484

00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,486
GAS? WOW!

447
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,490
INTENSE.

448
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,994
IF THIS IS THE WAY ALL THE GELLERS FLIRT

449
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,996
WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.

450
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:42,001
HEY, UH... YOU KNOW THAT SMELL GAS HAS?

451
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,506

00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,509
THEY PUT THAT IN.

453
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,011
WHAT?

454
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,013
THE GAS IS ODORLESS

455
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,015
BUT THEY ADD THE SMELL

456
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,518

00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,021
WELL, OKAY.

458
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,026
A LOT OF OTHER GAS SMELLS.

459
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,033
OH, THE HUMANITY.

00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,545
OH, BUT I I... I HAVEN'T PAID YOU YET.

467
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:43,062
WAS I TALKING TO HER ABOUT GAS?

468
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,565
MORE SO THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

469
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,069
I I... I FOUND IT INTERESTING.

470
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,573
I'M SORRY.

471
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,076
HEY, HEY, REALLY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

472
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,579
IN NINE YEARS, SHE AND I WILL BE RIGHT THERE.

00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,586
OKAY, WELL

474
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,589
I'M GOING TO CLEAR OUT SOME OF THESE BOXES.

475
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,096
ROSS?

476
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,097

477
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,100
WHAT ELSE DO THEY ADD SMELL TO?

00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,105
CAITLIN.

479
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,606

NO, NO, NO. EVERYTHING... THEY'RE FINE. GREAT PIZZA.

484
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,118
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY, UM, MY FRIEND, ROSS.

485
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:43,122
HE, UH, HE JUST GETS REALLY NERVOUS WHEN HE'S FLIRTING.

486
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,125
OH, MY GOD. THAT WAS FLIRTING?

487
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,626
YEAH. I KNOW. WOW.

493
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,140

00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,645
AND HE'S JUST... OH, HE'S GOT A GOOD HEART.

497
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,148
ACTUALLY, I DID THINK THAT HE WAS CUTE

498
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,650
AND THEN HE STARTED TALKING.

499
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,652

00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,668
YEAH... NO... BUT JUST...

507
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,171
I'M TELLING YOU, HE'S WORTH A SHOT.

508
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,173
IF HE'S SO GREAT, WHY DON'T YOU

509
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,674
GO OUT WITH HIM?

510
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,677
HMM.

511
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,679
WELL, YOU KNOW, AT SOME POINT

512
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,682

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

520
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,700
WELL, I DON'T GET IT

521
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,203

Commencing...

00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,800
Engines...

561
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,302

DEFINITELY.

567
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,325
NOT AS EACH OTHER.

568
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,327
OH. THEN, NO.

00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,830
HEY, YOU READY?
