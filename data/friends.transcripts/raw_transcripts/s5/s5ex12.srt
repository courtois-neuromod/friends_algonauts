1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,503
COME ON, JOEY.

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,006
RACH, I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING I KNEW LAST NIGHT.

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,507
LOOK, IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,009
SO MONICA AND CHANDLER ARE DOING IT.

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:13,013
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU WOULD SAY THAT.

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,516
SORRY. MONICA AND CHANDLER ARE "MAKING LOVE."

7
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,018
NO, I MEAN, COME ON

8
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,020
THIS IS A HUGE DEAL.                                   9 00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,022 COME ON, I NEED MORE DETAILS.

10
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,524
LIKE, WHO INITIATED THE FIRST KISS?

11
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,026
I DON'T KNOW.

12
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:30,030
I JUST CANNOT IMAGINE CHANDLER BEING ROMANTIC.

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,032
YEAH.

14
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,533
IS HE ROMANTIC WITH HER?

15
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,036
I DON'T KNOW.

16
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,539
ARE THEY IN LOVE?

17
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,041
I DON'T KNOW.

18
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,544
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

19
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,545
OH, I KNOW ONE THING.

20
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:46,546
WHAT?

21
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,547
THEY DID IT RIGHT THERE

22
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,549
ON THE COUCH YESTERDAY.

36
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,598
HEY, ROSS.

37
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,600
HEY. YEAH.

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,602
HEY, GUNTHER, COULD I HAVE A SCONE, PLEASE?

39
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,604
WANT TO HEAR SOME GOOD NEWS?

40
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,606
IS SOMEBODY ELSE GOING TO GIVE IT TO US

41
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,109
BECAUSE YOU CERTAINLY DON'T SEEM LIKE YOU HAVE ANY.

42
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,610
OH, NO, NO, NO. I DO.

43
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,112
SOMEONE I KNOW IS GETTING MARRIED.

44
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,614
YEAH, AND WEDDINGS ARE HAPPY OCCASIONS.

45
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,616
OH, BY THE BY, IT'S MY EX WIFE, EMILY.

46
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,118

47
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,619
I'M SORRY, MAN.

48
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,620
HERE'S YOUR SCONE.

49
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,621
THANKS, GUNTHER.

50
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,124
THANKS.

51
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,626
STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!

52
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,629
DID THEY TEACH YOU THAT

53
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,631
IN YOUR ANGER MANAGEMENT CLASS?

54
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,635
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT HELP YOU DEAL WITH IT?

55
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,137
THINK OF IT THIS WAY...

56
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,638
YOU AND EMILY ARE IN THE PAST.

57
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,640
AND YOU CAN'T BE MAD ABOUT THE PAST.

58
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,643
ARE YOU STILL MAD ABOUT THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE?

59
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,147
PHEEBS, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S MAD ABOUT THAT.

60
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,150
EXACTLY, BECAUSE IT'S IN THE PAST.

61
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,154
ANYBODY GOING TO EAT THAT?

62
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,660
LOOK AT US, ALL DRESSED  UP

63
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,661
FOR THE BIG OFFICE PARTY.

64
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,163
BY THE WAY, WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING?

65
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,165
OH, WE HAD A LOT OF LIQUOR LEFT OVER FROM THE CHRISTMAS PARTY.

66
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,666
I THINK THIS IS SO COOL.

67
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,668
I MEAN, NONE OF OUR FRIENDS ARE HERE

68
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,170
SO WE CAN, YOU KNOW, BE A REAL COUPLE.

69
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,671
WE DON'T HAVE TO HIDE.

70
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,173
I KNOW, I CAN DO THIS.

71
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,674
OOH.

72
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,176
AND I CAN DO THIS.

73
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,180
 WE CAN'T DO THAT, NO.

74
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,184
HEY, BING.

75
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,685
WHOA... WHO'S THE PRETTY LADY

76
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,687
AND WHAT THE HELL IS SHE DOING WITH YOU?

77
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,190
I ASK MYSELF THAT VERY QUESTION, SIR.

78
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,691
THIS IS MONICA.

79
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,692
THIS IS MY BOSS, DOUG.

80
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,694
DOUG, THIS IS MONICA. HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

81
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,196
HI, THIS IS MY WIFE, KARA.

82
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,197
NICE TO MEET YOU, MONICA.

83
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,698
BING! OKAY.

84
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,201
HEY, BING, DID YOU HEAR WE GOT A NEW LAW FIRM

85
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,203
WORKING FOR US? NO, SIR.

86
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,205
YEAH, DICKEM, STICKEM & RUN.

87
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:29,209

88
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,210
COME ON, HONEY

89
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,212
LET'S GO DRINK OUR BODY WEIGHT, HUH?

90
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,214
WHAT WAS THAT?

91
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,215
WHAT?

92
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,216
THAT NOISE YOU JUST MADE.

93
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,717
OH, THAT WAS MY WORK LAUGH.

94
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,219
REALLY? YOUR WORK LAUGH?

95
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,721
BELIEVE ME, IF YOU'RE GOING TO SURVIVE THIS PARTY

96
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,723
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME UP WITH ONE, TOO.

97
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,725
ALL RIGHT, CHECK ME OUT.

98
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,227
OKAY.

99
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,230
...HE SAYS, "30 DOLLARS, FATHER, SAME AS IN TOWN."

100
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,233

101
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,240
HEY, EVERYBODY AT WORK LOVED YOU LAST NIGHT.

102
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,241
REALLY?

103
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,242
AND THEY LIKE ME MORE

104
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,743
JUST BECAUSE I WAS WITH YOU.

105
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,745
I THINK YOU REPAIRED A LOT OF THE DAMAGE

106
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,247
FROM WHEN THEY MET JOEY.

107
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,750
AND DOUG WANTS US TO PLAY TENNIS WITH HIM.

108
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,752
HE'S NEVER EVEN TALKED TO ME OUTSIDE OF WORK.

109
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,754
EXCEPT FOR THAT TIME WHEN WE BUMPED INTO EACH OTHER

110
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,756
AT THAT STRIP CLUB.

111
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,758
STRIP... CHURCH.

112
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,762
ANYWAY, I'M GOING TO GO TRY TO FIND A RACKET.

113
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,763
HEY, I THOUGHT YOU ALREADY HAD ONE.

114
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,265
OH, I USED TO

115
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,267
BUT THEN JOEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN

116
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,268
TO GO TO CENTRAL PARK

117
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,270
AND HIT ROCKS AT BIGGER ROCKS.

118
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,273
HEY, RACH, DO YOU HAVE A TENNIS RACKET?

119
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,274
OH, YOU KNOW, I LENT IT TO JOEY

120
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,276
AND I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY GOTTEN IT BACK.

121
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,778
OKAY, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

122
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,283
HEY, WHAT'S UP? HEY.

123
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,784
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

124
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,287
I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO DO INVENTORY ALL DAY.

125
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,288
WELL, YEAH, I DO.

126
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,290
BUT, YOU KNOW, I DECIDED I WOULD TAKE A LONG LUNCH

127
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,292
AND SPEND SOME TIME    

WITH MY FRIEND, MONICA. 128 00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:56,296 YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE WE DON'T TALK ANYMORE.

129
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,297
HOW ARE YOU?

130
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,799
WHAT IS NEW WITH YOU?

131
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,802
UM, NOT MUCH.

132
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,305
UH... WORK'S GOOD.

133
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,807
OH, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WORK.

134
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,808
WE CAN TALK ABOUT ANYTHING.

135
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,311
OKAY, UM...

136
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,313
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

137
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,815
LET'S TALK ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS.

138
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,317
OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

139
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,319
NOTHING.

140
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,820
YOU GO.

141
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,822
WELL, THERE WAS THIS GUY

142
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,325
AT THE BANK THAT I THOUGHT WAS CUTE.

143
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,327
UM, BUT I DON'T ANYMORE.

144
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,330
WOW, THAT'S JUICY.

145
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,332
YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH, MON?

146
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,834
I ACTUALLY  DO HAVE A LOT  OF WORK TO DO.

147
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,338
SO, IF YOU'RE SURE THERE'S JUST NOT ANYTHING ELSE...?

148
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,839
YES, I'M SURE.

149
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,840
RACHEL, IS THERE SOMETHING

150
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,342
THAT YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

151
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,843
NO.

152
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,847
I...

153
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,350
IF THERE WAS, I WOULDN'T TELL YOU.

154
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,358

155
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,359
OKAY, THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

156
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,862
OH...

157
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,864
UH HUH, UH HUH.

158
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,865

159
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,867
YOU'LL GET YOUR TURN.

160
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,369
HEY, PHEEBS. HEY.

161
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,870
WHAT'S GOING ON? NOTHING.

162
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,372
THIS IS NOT OVER.

163
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,374
NO, NO, NO.

164
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,375
WHAT?

165
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,876
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT

166
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,379
WRITING THIS REALLY NASTY LETTER TO EMILY.

167
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,380
IT WAS PERFECT.

168
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,382
AND NOW IT'S ALL COVERED IN...

169
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,884
ACTUALLY, THANKS.

170
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,387
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY READY TO GO TO THE MOVIES?

171
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,889
UH, ACTUALLY I THINK I'M GOING TO SKIP IT.

172
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,391
REALLY?

173
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,892
YEAH, I'M GOING TO STAY AND READ MY BOOK.

174
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,394
I JUST WANT TO BE ALONE RIGHT NOW.

175
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,896
OH, SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO COME?

176
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,398
TOM HANKS, MEG RYAN...

177
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,400
THEY GET MAIL AND STUFF.

178
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,402
THAT'S OKAY, JOE.

179
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,903
ALL RIGHT.

180
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,405
LET'S GO, PHEEBS.

181
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,411
OOH... OH, GOD.

182
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,415
BING.

183
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,920

184
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,922
GAME.

185
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,925
WELL, I GOT TO TELL YOU, BING.

186
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,927
THAT PARTNER OF YOURS IS A REAL TIGER.

187
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,431
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SWEETHEART?

188
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,935
WE'RE JUST GOING TO GET A LITTLE SIP OF WATER.

189
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,939
AM I ON FIRE TODAY, OR WHAT?

190
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,442
THOSE BIRDS ARE BROWN, BASTED

191
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,444
AND READY TO BE CARVED.

192
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,447
OKAY... EASY, MARTINA.

193
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,451
LISTEN, I THINK WE SHOULD LET THEM WIN THE NEXT GAME.

194
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,954
I'M SORRY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

195
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,956
LET THEM WIN ONE.

196
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,458
ARE YOU CRAZY?

197
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,959
WE OWN THOSE TWO.

198
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,960
LOOK AT THEM.

199
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,964
HE CAN'T EVEN BREATHE AND SHE'S POPPIN' PILLS.

200
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,467
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GIVING THEM A CHANCE.

201
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,469
THEY HAVE RACKETS, DON'T THEY?

202
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,472
UH, BING, I THINK WE'RE

203
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,474
GOING TO MAKE THIS THE LAST GAME.

204
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,475
OH, YES, SIR.

205
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:56,976
PUT ME OUT OF MY MISERY.

206
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,978
ARE YOU SURE YOU NEVER PLAYED PRO?

207
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,980
PLEASE LET THEM WIN.

208
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,482
I'LL TAKE IT DOWN TO 95%

209
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,484
BUT THAT'S THE BEST I CAN DO.

210
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,491
OOPSEY, MISSED IT.

211
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,492
I GOT IT.

212
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,497
NICE SHOT.

213
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,007
I GOT IT.

214
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,010
LONG.

215
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,514

216
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,519
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU LET THEM WIN.

217
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,022
YEAH, AT LEAST YOU HID YOUR FEELINGS WELL ABOUT IT.

218
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,524
I WAS FRUSTRATED.

219
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,525
IT WAS MY RACKET.

220
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,026
I WAS FRUSTRATED WITH YOU.

221
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,528
IF WE HADN'T LOST THE GAME

222
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,530
THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE INVITED US

223
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,031
TO DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT.

224
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,032
YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY BOTHERS ME?

225
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,535
IT'S HOW DIFFERENT YOU ACT AROUND THEM.

226
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,537
I MEAN, THE THROWING THE TENNIS GAMES

227
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,039
THE FAKE LAUGH, THE "SEE YA LATER, BING."

228
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,041
"NOT IF I SEE YOU FIRST, DOUG."

229
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,543
"AH, AH, AH, AH!"

230
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:07,547
LISTEN, I DON'T SOUND LIKE SOME CRAZED, DRUNKEN PIRATE.

231
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,049
I KNOW--YOU DON'T, BUT "WORK CHANDLER" DOES.

232
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,552
I GOT TO TELL YOU, I DON'T LIKE "WORK CHANDLER."

233
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,053
OKAY? THE GUY'S A SUCK UP.

234
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,056
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? BECAUSE YOU SAID THAT

235
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,059
I'M NOT PUTTING OUT TONIGHT.

236
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,567
I'M TELLING YOU, SOMETHING'S WRONG.

237
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,569
MY BROTHER DOES NOT STAY OUT ALL NIGHT.

238
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,571
MAYBE WE SHOULD CHECK THE TRASH CHUTE.

239
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,575
ROSS COULDN'T FIT DOWN THE TRASH CHUTE.

240
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,077
THAT'S RIGHT, HE ALMOST COULD.

241
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,080
WHICH IS EXACTLY HOW I GOT STUCK THERE.

242
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,583
HEY.

243
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,085
OH, MY GOD.

244
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,087
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?

245
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,090
JUST... YOU KNOW, OUT.

246
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,091
OH... OUT.

247
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,593
OH, GOD, I DON'T KNOW WHY

248
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,595
WE DIDN'T THINK TO CHECK THERE.

249
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,597
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

250
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,099
I, UH... WENT TO A BAR.

251
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:04,604
AND THEN I JUST WALKED AROUND FOR A WHILE.

252
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,105
YOU WALK AROUND ALL NIGHT

253
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,607
IN THE CITY BY YOURSELF?

254
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,610
HE HOOKED UP.

255
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,113
HE HOOKED UP WITH SOMEONE.

256
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,616
LOOK, I DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS, OKAY?

257
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,118
I'M A BIG BOY. I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT.

258
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,119
HE HOOKED UP.

259
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,124
TELL US ABOUT HER.

260
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,126
ROSS, YOU LEFT YOUR SCARF IN...

261
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,634
HEY, YOU GUYS.

262
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,136

263
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,141
O OKAY. OKAY.

264
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,644
I KNOW WHAT YOU ALL ARE THINKING

265
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,145
BUT CHANDLER IS IN YEMEN.

266
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,149
I'M A YOUNG WOMAN. I HAVE NEEDS.

267
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,150
I CAN'T WAIT FOREVER.

268
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,653
YEAH, NO, THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING.

269
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,156
SO I'M ASKING YOU, PLEASE

270
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,659
JUST TAKE A MOMENT BEFORE YOU JUDGE ME.

271
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,661
OH, NOBODY'S JUDGING YOU.

272
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,663
OH. OKAY.

273
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,667
YOU, MR. "RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME"...

274
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,670
CALL ME.

275
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,672

276
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,178
SO...

277
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,180
I GUESS YOU FINISHED YOUR BOOK.

278
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,184
HAD SOME TIME ON OUR HANDS, DID WE?

279
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:29,689
OKAY, LOOK, I KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO SAY.

280
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,692
YOU TWO WOULD HAVE VERY HAIRY CHILDREN.

281
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,695
OKAY, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WOULD SAY THAT.

282
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,698
ROSS? JANICE?

283
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:39,699
ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON.

284
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:40,700
HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

285
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,201
THIS IS ROSS.

286
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,202
OKAY?

287
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,203
HE'S OUR FRIEND.

288
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,205
HE OBVIOUSLY WENT CRAZY.

289
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,708
HE OBVIOUSLY LOST HIS MIND.

290
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,213
LOOK, IT'S NOT THAT CRAZY, OKAY?

291
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,215
BUT IT'S JANICE.

292
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,218
I MEAN, SHE'S... JANICE.

293
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,722
I MEAN, HOW DRUNK WERE YOU?

294
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,724
LOOK, JANICE AND I HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

295
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,726
WE'VE... WE'VE BOTH BEEN DIVORCED.

296
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,728
WE... WE BOTH HAVE KIDS.

297
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,730
SO ARE YOU ACTUALLY GOING TO SEE HER AGAIN?

298
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,732
PHOEBE, DON'T PUT IDEAS IN HIS HEAD.

299
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,734
I AM GOING TO SEE HER AGAIN.

300
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,235
DAMN IT, PHOEBE!

301
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,741
OKAY, I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING

302
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,243
THAT I'VE NEVER ADMITTED THROUGHOUT OUR ENTIRE FRIENDSHIP

303
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,745
BUT WHEN WE WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL

304
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,746
I MADE OUT WITH JAMES FARROW

305
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,748
EVEN THOUGH I KNEW THAT YOU LIKED HIM.

306
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,249
WOW, THAT FEELS SO GOOD TO GET OFF MY CHEST.

307
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,250
OKAY, YOU GO.

308
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,752
MY TURN?

309
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,755
W WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

310
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,759
MONICA... I KNOW ABOUT YOU AND CHANDLER.

311
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,261
WHAT?

312
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,764
I OVERHEARD YOU GUYS ON THE PHONE THE OTHER DAY

313
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,766
AND YOU SAID, "I'LL JUST TELL RACHEL

314
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,769
THAT I'M DOING LAUNDRY FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS."

315
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,271
AND HE SAID, "LAUNDRY? IS THAT MY NEW NICKNAME?"

316
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,273
AND YOU SAID, "NO.

317
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,778
YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR NICKNAME IS, MR. BIG."

318
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,785
WELL... SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE WRITING YOURSELF

319
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,286
A LITTLE PLAY THERE, RACH.

320
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,791
WOW, I... LET ME KNOW HOW THAT ONE TURNS OUT.

321
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,292
WELL, I WOULDN'T KNOW

322
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,796
BECAUSE I GOT SO FREAKED OUT I HUNG UP THE PHONE.

323
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,799
WELL, IF YOU HAD KEPT LISTENING

324
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,303
Y YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD ME CALL HIM MR. BIG... IT.

325
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,304
WHAT?

326
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,306
MR. BIGOT.

327
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,808
I MEAN....

328
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,311
HE TELLS THE MOST RACIST JOKES.

329
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,313
ALL RIGHT. SO THAT'S IT?

330
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,817
YOU'RE TELLING ME THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON

331
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,819
BETWEEN YOU AND CHANDLER?

332
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,320
ME AND CHANDLER?

333
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,322

334
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,327
ALL RIGHT, PUT YOUR 20 BUCKS DOWN.

335
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,329
FIRST ONE TO FIND THE TASTY TREAT WINS. OKAY?

336
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,330
MM HMM.

337
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,832
ALL RIGHT.

338
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,836
LET'S GET THE CONTESTANTS OUT OF THEIR ISOLATION BOOTHS.

339
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,337
AND THEY'RE OFF.

340
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,839
OH...

341
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,341
GET YOUR FOOT OFF MY CONTESTANT. JUDGE?

342
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,844
JUDGE RULES NO VIOLATION.

343
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,845

344
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,346
HEY, GUYS.

345
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,849
HEY. YEAH.

346
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,851
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S SO WEIRD TO SAY THIS

347
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,853
BUT I JUST HAD A GREAT DATE WITH JANICE.

348
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:14,854
WHAT?

349
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,355
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

350
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,859
YEAH. I OPENED UP TO HER ABOUT ALL THE TERRIBLE STUFF

351
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,360
THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING TO ME.

352
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,862
I MEAN, I TALKED FOR HOURS.

353
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,363
IT IS AMAZING

354
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,867
TO HAVE SOMEONE GIVE YOU SUCH... SUCH FOCUSED ATTENTION.

355
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,869
YOU DON'T NEED JANICE FOR THAT.

356
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:30,870
YOU'VE GOT US.

357
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,872
THE DUCK GETS A NUTTER BUTTER.

358
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,373
EEW! OH, HEY, THAT'S NOT

359
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,374
A NUTTER BUTTER.

360
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,376
THAT'S JUST AN OLD WONTON.

361
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,878
JUDGE RULES...

362
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,879
NUTTER BUTTER.

363
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,380

364
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,882
TOUGH CALL. YEAH.

365
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,886

366
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,888
BUT, SERIOUSLY, I STRONGLY BELIEVE

367
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,891
THAT WE SHOULD ALL SUPPORT PRESIDENT CLINTON

368
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,892
AND HER HUSBAND, BILL.

369
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,395

370
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,397
SO, HOW DO YOU KIDS LIKE YOUR COFFEE?

371
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,899
OH, NONE FOR ME, THANKS.

372
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,900
A LITTLE BIT OF SUGAR.

373
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,901
WELL, MAYBE I'LL BRING IT OUT

374
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,903
AND HAVE MONICA STICK HER FINGER IN IT.

375
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,904
THAT'LL SWEETEN IT UP.

376
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,906

377
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,910
HOW DOES THAT LAUGH NOT GIVE YOU A HEADACHE?

378
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,911
OH, YOU GET USED TO IT.

379
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,412
I I DON'T THINK THAT I CAN

380
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,914
SO, IF YOU DON'T MIND

381
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,415
MAYBE THIS WILL BE IT FOR ME ON THE WORK THINGS.

382
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,917
SO I LAUGH AT MY BOSS'S JOKES.

383
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,918
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

384
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,419
I'D RATHER NOT HANG OUT

385
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,921
WITH THIS SNIVELING, WORK WEASEL GUY

386
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,424
WHEN I COULD BE HANGING OUT WITH MY BOYFRIEND, WHO I ACTUALLY RESPECT.

387
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,926
OH.

388
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,430
AH. I GOT TO APOLOGIZE FOR KARA'S COFFEE, YOU KNOW?

389
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,933
FEEL SORRY FOR IT IF IT EVER GOT IN A FIGHT.

390
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,935
IT'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO DEFEND ITSELF.

391
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,936

392
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,438

393
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,441
DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID, BING?

394
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,944
WHAT?

395
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,945
IT'S A JOKE, BING.

396
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,947
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

397
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,450
WELL, I I, I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT WAS FUNNY, SIR.

398
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,451
EXCUSE ME?

399
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,953
WELL, I I JUST...

400
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:58,958
HONEY, I JUST DON'T THINK THAT YOU UNDERSTOOD THE JOKE.

401
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,959
REALLY?

402
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,460
YEAH. I MEAN...

403
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,962
IT WAS REALLY FUNNY.

404
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,964
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT YOU GOT IT.

405
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,467
YOU SEE, KARA'S COFFEE IS, IS, IS WEAK TASTING

406
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,970
OKAY, BUT WHAT DOUG DID WAS TO IMPLY

407
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,972
THAT IT WAS WEAK PHYSICALLY.

408
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,475
YOU GET IT NOW, HONEY?

409
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,476
I THINK I DO.

410
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,978

411
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,981

412
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,482
THANK YOU, MONICA.

413
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,484
I THOUGHT YOU COULD USE THE HELP.

414
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,487
COFFEE IN A FIGHT!

415
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,489

416
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,493
HEY, RACH.

417
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,495
HEY, YOU MIND IF I READ MY COMIC BOOKS IN HERE?

418
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,999
SURE. WHY?

419
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,500
OH, WELL

420
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,002
CHANDLER AND MONICA ARE OVER THERE

421
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,504
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF HARD TO CONCENTRATE.

422
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,006
WHAT?! SHE JUST CALLED

423
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,009
AND SAID THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE WORKING LATE.

424
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,011
OKAY, SHE KEEPS LYING TO ME.

425
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,012
THAT'S IT. YOU KNOW WHAT?

426
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,513
I'M GOING TO GO OVER THERE

427
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,016
AND I'M CONFRONTING THEM RIGHT NOW.

428
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,519
PANTY RAID.

429
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,532
 ALL RIGHT, SO YOU'RE TELLING ME

430
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,534
THAT I HAVE TO TELL RACIST JOKES NOW?

431
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,038
 I'M SORRY. I'M JUST, I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT THIS.

432
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,539
I'M A TERRIBLE LIAR

433
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,041
AND I HATE HAVING TO LIE TO RACHEL.

434
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,043
YEAH, BUT WE'RE NOT READY TO TELL YET.

435
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,544
I KNOW. IT'S JUST THAT

436
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,047
EVER SINCE HIGH SCHOOL , RACHEL WAS THE ONE PERSON

437
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,049

438
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,051
I MISS THAT SO MUCH NOW.

00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,553

484
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,172

485
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,674

486
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,176

BECAUSE I'M TOO WHINY?

501
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,225

505
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,737
ANNOY YOU.

506
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,739
JANICE.

00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,241
WELL, YEAH!

HI. UH...

00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,758
OH, HI.

514
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,761
WELL...

515
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,764
I GUESS THAT'S TWO OUT OF THREE.

516
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,765
JOEY.

517
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,267

DUDE, WE GOT TO TALK.

00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,279
OKAY.

520
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,281
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING

521
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,283
BEFORE YOU HEARD IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE

522
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,285
AND I HOPE THIS ISN'T TOO WEIRD

523
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,786
BUT, UH...

524
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:31,290
I HAD A A THING WITH JANICE.

525
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,793

526
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,796
WHAT, YOU'RE, YOU'RE NOT MAD?

527
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,298
WHY WOULD I BE MAD?

528
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,800
WELL, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES

529
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,801
ABOUT THIS KIND OF STUFF.

530
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,803
YOU DON'T, UH, YOU DON'T FOOL AROUND

531
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,305
WITH YOUR FRIENDS' EX GIRLFRIENDS

532
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,806
UH OR,

533
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:51,310
POSSIBLE GIRLFRIENDS, OR GIRLS THEY'RE RELATED TO.

534
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,317
I AM MAD.

535
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,320
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO?

536
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,823
I'M GONNA FORGIVE YOU, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS DO.

537
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:05,824
THEY FORGIVE THEIR FRIENDS

538
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,326
WHEN THEY DO EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID.

539
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,827
ALL THE THINGS ON THE LIST THERE.

540
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,829
THANK YOU. WELL

541
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:14,833
BUT I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT I FORGAVE YOU.

00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,336
OKAY.

543
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,338
I ALSO WANT YOU TO REMEMBER

544
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,340

545
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,342

00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:29,348
AND I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT I GAVE YOU... 27 DOLLARS.

547
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,850
NO STRINGS ATTACHED.

548
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,851
IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER THAT

549
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,354
I THINK WE SHOULD WRITE IT DOWN. LET'S WRITE IT DOWN.
