00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:13,396
YOU LOOK CUTE IN BUBBLES.

00:00:13,396 --> 00:00:16,199
AH, YOU'RE JUST ALL LIQUORED UP.

3
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:19,002

4
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:20,203
 HEY, IT'S ME.

5
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:21,805
I'M COMING IN.

6
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:31,014
I'VE HAD A VERY LONG, HARD DAY.

7
00:00:32,882 --> 00:00:33,883
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

8
00:00:33,883 --> 00:00:35,885
YEAH, MY DATE THREW UP.

9
00:00:36,386 --> 00:00:38,588
I'M GOING TO GO GET SOME CHICKEN. YOU WANT SOME?

10
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:39,789
NO, THANKS. NO CHICKEN.

11
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:40,990
BYE BYE THEN.

12
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,592
OKAY.

13
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:44,194
YOU SURE? SOME EXTRA CRISPY?

14
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:45,395
DIRTY RICE? BEANS?

15
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:46,596
FOR THE LAST TIME, NO.

16
00:00:46,596 --> 00:00:47,797
GET OUT. GET OUT, JOEY.

17
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,799
ALL RIGHT.

18
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,403

19
00:00:53,403 --> 00:00:54,604
ARE YOU OKAY?

20
00:00:54,604 --> 00:00:56,206
I'M SO SORRY. HE WOULDN'T LEAVE.

21
00:00:56,206 --> 00:00:57,407
HE KEPT ASKING ME

22
00:00:57,407 --> 00:00:58,608
IF I WANTED CHICKEN.

23
00:00:58,608 --> 00:01:00,210
CHICKEN?

24
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,413
I COULD EAT SOME CHICKEN.

25
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:05,014
HEY, JOE!

26
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:10,620
YEAH, COULD I GET A THREE PIECE, SOME COLE SLAW

27
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,222

28
00:01:12,222 --> 00:01:13,022

29
00:01:13,423 --> 00:01:15,425
...DIET COKE.

30
00:01:19,028 --> 00:01:24,250

31
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,539
??  ? ?

32
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:31,541

33
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:34,744

34
00:01:34,744 --> 00:01:39,149
??  ??

36
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,754
??  ??

37
00:01:45,155 --> 00:01:48,758
??  ? ?

38
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:53,963
??  ??

39
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:58,718
HEY!

40
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,053
HEY! HEY, PHEEBS!

41
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,654
OH, I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS STORY.

42
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,057
I WAS COMING OVER HERE AND THIS CAB DRIVER...

43
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,258
WAS HIS NAME ANGUS?

44
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,860

45
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,061
WHAT?

46
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,463
HE WAS THIS CAB DRIVER WE HAD IN LONDON.

47
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,664
OH. HA HA HA.

48
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,266
ALL RIGHT, ANYWAY...

49
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,268
 WHAT WAS THAT PLACE

50
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,469
THAT PUB HE TOOK US TO?

51
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,670
THE WHEAT SHEAF.

52
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,672
AND THEY HAD THAT BEER, THAT, UH...

53
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:20,473
BODDINGTON'S.

54
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,075
BODDINGTON'S. BODDINGTON'S.

55
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,276
THAT'S IT, BABY.

56
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,280
OH, PHEEBS WAS GOING TO TELL A STORY.

57
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,083
OKAY, SO, HE HAD A REALLY FUNNY HAT.

58
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,485
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

59
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:34,888
HEY.

60
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,089
HEY, ROSS.

61
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,290
BODDINGTON'S.

62
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,491
YEAH! YEAH!

63
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,692
OH, MAN.

64
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,095
THAT WAS GOOD BEER.

65
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,696
YOU KNOW, I'D WALK BACK TO LONDON

66
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,298
FOR ANOTHER FROSTY ONE OF THOSE BAD BOYS.

67
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,300
YOU KNOW, I THINK THEY HAVE THOSE

68
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,302
AT THAT BRITISH PUB BY THE TRADE CENTER.

69
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,304
LATER.

70
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,306
ISN'T RACHEL SUPPOSED TO BE BACK BY NOW?

71
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,908
HER PLANE GOT DELAYED IN ATHENS

72
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,910
BUT, ACTUALLY, SHE SHOULD BE HERE BY NOW.

73
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,111
S SO YOU TALKED TO HER?

74
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,712
DID SHE... DID SHE SOUND MAD?

75
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,115
NO, BUT SHE LIKES ME.

76
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,517
YOU ABANDONED HER ON A PLANE TO GREECE.

77
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,720
OKAY, I DID NOT ABANDON RACHEL, OKAY?

78
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,523
EMILY SHOWED UP AT THE AIRPORT.

79
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,724
I HAD TO GO AFTER HER.

80
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,726
I MEAN, I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

81
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:14,928
SHE'S MY WIFE.

82
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,529
RACHEL IS MY WIFE, YOU KNOW.

83
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,932
EMILY!

84
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,135
EMILY IS MY WIFE.

85
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:25,338
MAN, WHAT IS THAT?

86
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,740
SO YOU STILL HAVEN'T HEARD FROM EMILY?

87
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,143
NO, NOT SINCE I LOST HER AT THE AIRPORT.

88
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,145
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE CAN OUTRUN YOU, MAN.

89
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,348
HEY, SHE'S FAST, OKAY?

90
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,750
OH, YOU THINK YOU CAN BEAT ME?

91
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,352
LET'S GO, OUTSIDE!

92
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,323
I'M SORRY. I'M I'M JUST A LITTLE...

93
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:44,324
SLOW?

94
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,592
OH, YOU WANT SOME?!

95
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,111
HUH?! OKAY, GET THE SHOES ON.

96
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:49,562
LET'S GO, MAN.

97
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,531
IT'S COOL, OKAY?

98
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,533
YOU'RE THE FASTEST.

99
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:56,669
HI.

100
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,354
RACHEL! HI!

101
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,958
RACH, RACH, I AM SO SORRY.

102
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:03,960
I AM SO, SO SORRY.

103
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,161
OH, ROSS, COME ON.

104
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,763
YOU JUST DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.

105
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:09,565
THAT'S IT?

106
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:11,167
YOU'RE NOT MAD?

107
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,769
I MEAN, IT MUST HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE.

108
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:15,171
TERRIBLE? HELL, I WAS IN GREECE.

109
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,573
THAT WAS A NICE HOTEL.

110
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:18,775
NICE BEACH.

111
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:20,777
MET THE NICE PEOPLE.

112
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:22,378
NOT TOO SHABBY FOR RACHEL.

113
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,183
SO, WHAT? THAT'S IT?

114
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,384
WELL, YEAH.

115
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:30,386
WE'RE COOL. TOTALLY COOL.

116
00:04:32,388 --> 00:04:33,189
THANKS, RACH.

117
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,390
OH, YOU'RE THE BEST.

118
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,593
OH, NO, YOU'RE THE BEST.

119
00:04:37,593 --> 00:04:41,197
OH, I GOT TO GO TO THE FLOWER STORE.

120
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,398
CHECK IT OUT.

121
00:04:42,398 --> 00:04:44,400
NO ONE WILL TELL ME WHERE EMILY IS.

122
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:47,603
SO I'M GOING TO SEND 72 LONG STEMMED RED ROSES

123
00:04:47,603 --> 00:04:48,805
TO HER PARENTS' HOUSE.

124
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:51,207
ONE FOR EACH DAY THAT I'VE KNOWN AND LOVED HER.

125
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,609
THAT OUGHT TO GET HER TALKING TO ME AGAIN.

126
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:56,012
OH, ROSS, WHEN YOU MAKE OUT THE CARD

127
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:58,815
BE SURE TO MAKE IT OUT TO EMILY.

128
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:02,819
RACH, THAT'S GREAT.

129
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:05,621
IT'S SO GOOD YOU HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME IN GREECE.

130
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:09,225
WHAT?

131
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,627
I DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD TIME IN GREECE.

132
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:14,430
ROSS ABANDONED ME, OKAY?

133
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:16,432
I COULDN'T GET A PLANE OUT

134
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:19,235
SO I HAD TO STAY IN THEIR HONEYMOON SUITE

135
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,637
WITH PEOPLE COMING UP TO ME ALL THE TIME, GOING

136
00:05:21,637 --> 00:05:24,440
"OH, MRS. GELLER, WHY YOU CRY?"

137
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,044
I MEAN, IT WAS SO HUMILIATING.

138
00:05:28,044 --> 00:05:30,046
I FELT LIKE SUCH AN IDIOT.

139
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:31,647
I MEAN, IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

140
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:32,849
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

141
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:36,452
BECAUSE I MAKE VERY BAD DECISIONS.

142
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:38,054
OH, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

143
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:39,655
YES, IT IS. IT IS TRUE.

144
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:41,657
I WENT AFTER ROSS IN STUPID LONDON.

145
00:05:41,657 --> 00:05:44,460
LONDON IS STUPID. STUPID.

146
00:05:46,295 --> 00:05:49,766
I PUT ON A CHEERLEADING OUTFIT TO SEDUCE JOSHUA

147
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:54,270
THEN I LOST HIM BECAUSE I ASKED HIM TO MARRY ME AFTER FOUR DATES

148
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,272
AND THEN I WENT TO GREECE

149
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,274
ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S HONEYMOON, OKAY?

150
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,778
DO THOSE SOUND LIKE VERY GOOD DECISIONS TO YOU?

151
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,264
I LIKE YOUR LITTLE BRAID.

152
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,749
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

153
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:08,751
I JUST SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO MAKE DECISIONS ANYMORE.

154
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:09,752
PHOEBE, YOU WERE RIGHT.

155
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:11,254
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER GONE TO LONDON

156
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:12,255
AND FROM NOW ON

157
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:14,257
YOU MAKE ALL OF MY DECISIONS FOR ME.

158
00:06:14,257 --> 00:06:16,259
OH, NO, I DID THAT FOR SOMEONE ONCE.

159
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,262
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE HAVING THAT KIND OF POWER

160
00:06:19,262 --> 00:06:20,763
AND CONTROL OVER SOMEONE'S LIFE.

161
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:22,265
I'LL DO IT.

162
00:06:22,265 --> 00:06:23,766
 THAT'S FINE.

163
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:27,820
SO, MONICA, YOU ARE NOW IN CHARGE OF MY LOVE LIFE.

164
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,223
OKAY, I GOT TO GO TO WORK.

165
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:43,436
AND RACHEL, GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK.

166
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,442
PHEEBS!

167
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,649
ALWAYS A PLEASURE.

168
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,860
OH, RACHEL, SWEETIE, LOOK.

169
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,061
HERE'S A REALLY CUTE PICTURE

170
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:10,663
OF YOU AND JOEY AT THE RECEPTION.

171
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,265
OH, HE'S MARRIED.

172
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,466
ROSS IS MARRIED.

173
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,868
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

174
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:18,271
HONEY, SWEETIE, BY THE EDGES.

175
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,673
I MEAN, I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE TO ACCEPT IT.

176
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:21,474
OH!

177
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,075
IT'S MY FAULT.

178
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,277
SWEETIE... EDGES...

179
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,478
FINGERS... SMUDGY...

180
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,079
OH, MY GOD! AH!

181
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,886
THAT'S OKAY. THAT'S OKAY.

182
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,888
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE VERY UPSET RIGHT NOW.

183
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,089
I KNOW THAT WASN'T ABOUT ME.

184
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,293
I BET IT WAS ABOUT HER A LITTLE.

185
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,894
IF YOU WOULD STOP THINKING ABOUT ROSS FOR ONE MINUTE

186
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,297
YOU WOULD NOTICE THERE WERE GREAT GUYS EVERYWHERE.

187

00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:46,699

00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,502

190
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,103

00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,906
YEAH, I GUESS GUNTHER IS...

192
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:54,707

193
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:55,908
THAT GUY OVER THERE?

194
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,111
REMEMBER? THAT IS THE GUY THAT YOU FLIRTED WITH

195
00:07:59,111 --> 00:07:59,912
AT THE COUNTER THAT TIME.

196
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,516
OH, I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

197
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:04,717
YOU'RE GOING TO TALK TO HIM.

198
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:05,518
WE MADE A DEAL.

199
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:06,719
I MAKE YOUR DECISIONS

200
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,721
AND I SAY YOU'RE GOING TO TALK TO HIM.

201
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,323
ALL RIGHT.

202
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,524
YOU'RE THE BOSS.

203
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,926
I GUESS I GOT TO DO WHAT YOU TELL ME.

204
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,729
SAY THAT TO HIM AND YOU'RE GOLDEN.

205
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,335
HEY. HEY.

206
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,936
HEY, PHEEBS. HEY, PHEEBS.

207
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,538
WE GOT OUR PICTURES BACK FROM LONDON.

208
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,341
HERE'S ALL OF US AT THE TOWER OF LONDON...

209
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,743
OH, YEAH, THERE WE ALL ARE.

210
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,546
YEAH, THERE'S ROSS AND JOEY AND YOU AND...

211
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,948
AND ME.

212
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,353
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT LONDON TOO MUCH, HAVEN'T WE?

213
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,554
NO, I'M SORRY.

214
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,155
IT'S JUST BECAUSE I COULDN'T BE THERE

215
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,958
BECAUSE ALL I EVER GET TO DO NOW IS PREGNANT STUFF.

216
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,159
IT JUST BUMS ME OUT.

217
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,478
SORRY, PHEEBS. OH, WE'RE SORRY.

218
00:08:49,478 --> 00:08:50,980
YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE TO DO?

219
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,481
IT SOUNDS A LITTLE CORNY

220
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:53,966
BUT SOMETIMES WHEN I'M BUMMED OUT

221
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,968
I LIKE TO JUST CLOSE MY EYES

222
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,471
AND THINK ABOUT WHAT A WONDERFUL GIFT LIFE IS.

223
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,456
OH!

224
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:06,279

225
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:07,246
SEE?

226
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,749
UH HUH.

227
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,717
WHAT HAPPENED?

228
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,202
WELL, YOU KNOW, A LITTLE OF THIS

229
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:14,437
A LITTLE OF THAT.

230
00:09:14,437 --> 00:09:16,839
I GOT MYSELF A DATE TOMORROW NIGHT.

231
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:18,057
SEE? DIDN'T I TELL YOU?

232
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,059
YOU'RE GETTING OVER ROSS ALREADY.

233
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,663
GET OUT.

234
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,679
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

235
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,280
I GOT CAUGHT UP AT WORK

236
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,882
BUT I'M QUITTING TOMORROW.

237
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,489
SO, THANKS FOR HAVING ME OVER.

238
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,093
RACH.

239
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,900
PHEEBS.

240
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:09,709
SEE YA!

241
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,914
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

242
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,717
PROBABLY SOME EUROPEAN GOOD BYE THING

243
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,318
HE PICKED UP IN LONDON.

244
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:20,119
I DON'T...

245
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,721
IT'S NOT EUROPEAN.

246
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,123
WELL, IT FELT FRENCH.

247
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,327
WELL, I GUESS IT'S TIME

248
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,329
FOR ME TO SAY GOOD BYE, TOO... MON FRERE.

249
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:33,833
COME HERE. GIVE ME A LITTLE SUGAR.

250
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,775
OH, GOD, I REALLY HAD A GOOD TIME.

251
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:43,776
YEAH, ME, TOO.

252
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,278

253
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,731
SO, I GUESS THIS IS IT.

254
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,333
YEAH, UM...

255
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,135
UNLESS YOU WANT TO COME INSIDE.

256
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:53,936
YEAH.

257
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:55,938
OKAY... OH, UH...

258
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:56,739
YOU KNOW WHAT?

259
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,141
I, UH... I CAN'T DECIDE THIS.

260
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:00,343
UM...

261
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:03,546
OKAY, JUST HOLD ON A SECOND.

262
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:04,747
YEAH.

263
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,151
UH, HI.

264
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:10,753
HI.

265
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,554
IS MONICA AROUND?

266
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:13,155
I HAVE TO ASK HER SOMETHING.

267
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:15,157
DOING HER LAUNDRY.

268
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:16,359
WHAT'S THAT?

269
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:19,962
IT CAME IN THE MAIL TODAY.

270
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:22,765
IT'S 72 LONG STEMMED RED ROSES

271
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:26,369
ONE FOR EACH DAY I'VE KNOWN AND LOVED EMILY

272
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,572
CUT UP INTO MULCH.

273
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,974
OH, HONEY, THAT'S AWFUL.

274
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,777
OH, IT'S NOT SO BAD.

275
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:38,381
MONICA'S GOING TO MAKE POTPOURRI.

276
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:42,785
I THINK I'M GOING TO GO WANDER OUT

277
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,387
IN THE RAIN FOR A WHILE.

278
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:45,988
BUT IT'S NOT RAINING.

279
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:49,992
I CAN'T CATCH A BREAK.

280
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:50,793
YOU KNOW WHAT, ROSS?

281
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:51,994
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

282
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:53,596
YOU'RE GOING TO SIT RIGHT HERE.

283
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:55,197
I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU A CUP OF TEA

284
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:57,600
AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK THIS WHOLE THING OUT.

285
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,801
ALL RIGHT?

286
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:02,805
HEY, DAVE.

287
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,006
YEAH.

288
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:06,409
LISTEN, I'M GOING TO NEED TO TAKE A RAIN CHECK.

289
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:08,010
MY ROOMMATE IS JUST REALLY SICK.

290
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:09,211
OKAY? BYE.

291
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,217
HONEY, LISTEN...

292
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:16,018
I KNOW...

293
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:18,421
GOD, I KNOW THINGS SEEM SO BAD...

294
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:20,022
RACH?

295
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:22,825
COULD I TALK TO YOU JUST FOR A MINUTE?

296
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:26,429
I DROPPED SOME SOCKS.

297
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:28,030
YEAH.

298
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:36,439
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

299
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,040
DO YOU WANT TO FALL INTO THE TRAP?

300
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:40,443
DO YOU WANT TO FALL INTO THE TRAP?

301
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:43,646
YOU DID NOT DROP ANY SOCKS!

302
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:44,447
I JUST RAN INTO DAVE

303
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:45,648
AND HE TOLD ME YOU BLEW HIM OFF.

304
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:46,849
YOU LISTEN TO ME.

305
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:48,050
I'M CALLING THE SHOTS.

306
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:50,453
I SAY YOU LEAVE ROSS ALONE AND GO GET DAVE.

307
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,455
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?

308
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:55,257
WELL, ULTIMATELY, I WAS TRYING...

309
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:56,859
YOU KNOW, I WANTED...

310
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,062
TO TELL HIM I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH HIM.

311
00:13:00,062 --> 00:13:01,263
WHAT?

312
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:03,666
YOU CANNOT TELL HIM THAT.

313
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,267
WHY? WHY NOT?

314
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:07,203
PEOPLE LOVE TO HEAR THAT.

315
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,672
COME ON. I LOVE YOU.

316
00:13:10,172 --> 00:13:11,640
THERE. WASN'T THAT NICE?

317
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,126
NO. I MAKE THE DECISIONS AND I SAY "NO."

318
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,411
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

319
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:17,012
NO, YOU DON'T MAKE MY DECISIONS

320
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:19,014
BECAUSE... YOU'RE FIRED.

321
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:19,815

322
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:21,817
YOU CAN'T FIRE ME.

323
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:27,022
I MAKE YOUR DECISIONS AND I SAY I'M NOT FIRED. HA!

324
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,425
WELL...

325
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,232

326
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:40,236
RACHEL!

327
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,437
COME ON, LET ME IN.

328
00:13:41,837 --> 00:13:44,240
HAVING SOME TROUBLE?

329
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,841
RACHEL LOCKED THE DOOR.

330
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,044
I'LL KICK THAT DOOR IN IF YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE SUGAR.

331
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:53,883
ROSS, THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

332
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:54,683
I JUST NEED TO...

333
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,285

334
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:57,887
RACHEL, OPEN THIS DOOR!

335
00:13:58,687 --> 00:13:59,638
WHAT, IS IT LOCKED?

336
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,141
SHE SHE'S FINE. LISTEN, UM...

337
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,927
RACHEL, I CAN DO THIS ALL NIGHT IF I HAVE TO.

338
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,762
DO YOU WANT ME TO GET THAT?

339
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,013
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?

340
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,099
JUST JUST LET HER DO HER THING AND WE'LL DO OUR THING

341
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,901
BECAUSE I REALLY NEED TO TELL YOU...

342
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:13,853

343
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,742
THANK YOU.

344
00:14:22,144 --> 00:14:25,347
RACHEL... CAN I TALK TO YOU OUTSIDE FOR A SEC?

345
00:14:25,347 --> 00:14:26,549
NO.

346
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,752
I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

347
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:31,353
WELL, THEN, TALK.

348
00:14:31,353 --> 00:14:33,355
OKAY, I WILL.

349
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:38,160
REMEMBER THAT THING THAT WE JUST DISCUSSED

350
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,361
THAT YOU WANTED TO DO?

351
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:40,963
YES.

352
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,164
WHAT THING?

353
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:44,166
 WELL...

354
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:48,571
RACHEL WANTS TO TAKE SWING DANCE LESSONS...

355
00:14:48,571 --> 00:14:50,973
WHICH I THINK IS A REALLY STUPID IDEA.

356
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,174
IT'S DANGEROUS.

357
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:54,577
SHE'S NEVER GOING TO GET WHAT SHE WANTS

358
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:56,178
AND WHO KNOWS WHO SHE MIGHT

359
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:58,180
END UP HURTING?

360
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:08,591
MONICA'S RIGHT, SWING DANCING CAN BE TRICKY.

361
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:11,393
I'M GOING TO USE THE PHONE.

362
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:12,995
I GOT TO CANCEL

363
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,798
THOSE FIVE GIANT TEDDY BEARS I SENT TO EMILY.

364
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:17,800
MY GOD, THINK OF THE MASSACRE.

365
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:20,202
I'M GOING TO DO IT.

366
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:21,403
ALL RIGHT... RACHEL...

367
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:22,605
OKAY, I KNOW YOU THINK I'M CRAZY

368
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,206
BUT BEFORE YOU TELL HIM YOU LOVE HIM

369
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:26,609
JUST TRY TO FIND ONE PERSON WHO THINKS THIS IS A GOOD IDEA

370
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:27,810
BECAUSE I BET YOU CAN'T.

371
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,011
BUT I R...

372
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:29,812
PLEASE!

373
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:33,015
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

374
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:35,417

375
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,822
JOEY, I'M IN!

376
00:15:39,822 --> 00:15:42,224
ALL RIGHT, GOOD DEAL.

377
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,082
HI.

378
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,083
HEY, RACH. HEY.

379
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,520
SO, DID YOU FIND ANYONE WHO AGREES WITH YOU YET?

380
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,005
NO, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

381
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:58,007
I THINK... I THINK I NEED A MALE POINT OF VIEW.

382
00:15:58,507 --> 00:15:59,008
HMM.

383
00:15:59,008 --> 00:15:59,959
JOEY?

384
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:03,929
YOU'RE A MAN.

385
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,432
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

386
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,434
NOW, DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA

387
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,436
IF I TOLD ROSS THAT I WAS STILL IN LOVE WITH HIM?

388
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,920
NOPE.

389
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,290
HEY...

390
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,291
PHEEBS! PHOEBE!

391
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,793
 HEY, PHEEBS.

392
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:19,011
UH...

393
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,612
OKAY... PHEEBS?

394
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,614
YEAH? UM...

395
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,216
YOU KNOW HOW THE OTHER DAY YOU WERE TALKING

396
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,218
ABOUT HOW YOU DIDN'T GET TO GO TO LONDON

397
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,419
AND YOU WERE KIND OF FEELING LEFT OUT?

398
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,620
YEAH.

399
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,421
ALL RIGHT, WELL

400
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,423
WE ALL FELT REALLY BAD ABOUT THAT

401
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,624
SO... WE DECIDED

402
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,027
THAT WE SHOULD ALL TAKE A LITTLE TRIP TOGETHER.

403
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,429
OH, THAT'S SO NICE!

404
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,230
HOW GREAT! WHERE?

405
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,431
WHERE'S THE TRIP?

406
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,632
WELL...

407
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,035
WE THOUGHT WE WOULD ALL GO TO A PICNIC...

408
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:43,836

409
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,437
IN CENTRAL PARK!

410
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,840
CENTRAL PARK?

411
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,441
YEAH, ALL OF US, ALL DAY.

412
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,443
THAT SUCKS.

413
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:53,445
THAT'S NOT A TRIP.

414
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,047
I JUST CAME FROM THE PARK.

415
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,648
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO HIGH FIVE ABOUT

416
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,250
AT THE STUPID CENTRAL PARK?

417
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,852
WELL, IT'S RIGHT BY MY HOUSE.

418
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,652
ALL RIGHT!

419
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:03,856
WELL, I'M GOING TO GO HOME

420
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:07,059
AND BASK IN THE TRIUMPH OF MY CENTRAL PARK IDEA.

421
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:07,860
HEY, WHOA!

422
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,262
HOLD ON A SEC THERE, MR. KISSY.

423
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,264
YOU KNOW

424
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,266
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO TALK TO YOU

425
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,668
ABOUT THIS WHOLE, LITTLE, NEW EUROPEAN THING

426
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,270
YOU'VE GOT GOING ON

427
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,473
AND I JUST NEED TO TELL YOU IT MAKES ME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE

428
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,475
AND I JUST... YOU KNOW, JUST STOP IT.

429
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:24,676
WELL, I WAS JUST TRYING

430
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:27,079
TO BRING A LITTLE CULTURE TO THE GROUP.

431
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,682
THAT'S FINE, JUST DON'T BRING IT IN MY MOUTH.

432
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,284
IT MAKES ME WANT TO PUKE.

433
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,627
HEY, EVERYBODY, PHEEBS IS HERE.

434
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:42,828
PHOEBE! HEY, PHOEBE!

435
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,629
HEY, PHEEBS!

436
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,097
HEY, PHOEBE, WHOO!

437
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,900
OKAY, WHOO, HI.

438
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,101
OKAY, PHEEBS... WE DECIDED

439
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,503
THAT THE PICNIC IDEA WAS A LITTLE...

440
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,505
YOU KNOW, IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY...

441
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:54,706
WELL, IT BLEW.

442
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,308
SO...

443
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,710
WE THOUGHT THAT THIS AFTERNOON

444
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,914
WE WOULD ALL GO AWAY FOR THE WHOLE WEEKEND

445
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,115
TO ATLANTIC CITY.

446
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,716
OOH, ATLANTIC CITY!

447
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,318
OH, THAT'S A GREAT PLAN.

448
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,920
WHOSE PLAN WAS THAT?

449
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,121
MINE.

450
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:09,922

451
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,123
WAIT.

452
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:11,924
IT WAS MY PLAN.

453
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,125
 NO...

454
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,527
I SAID WE NEEDED  A NEW PLAN.

455
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,930
AND I CAME UP WITH ATLANTIC CITY.

456
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,131
WHICH IS THE NEW PLAN.

457
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:20,732

458
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,336
OKAY, WELL, WHY DON'T WE, UM

459
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,537
ALL MEET UPSTAIRS IN AN HOUR?

460
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:26,738

461
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,141
OKAY. OOH, ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO GO PACK.

462
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,742
I'M GOING TO GO PACK MY ASS OFF.

463
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,344
WHOO!

464
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,730
WELL, I THINK I'M GOING TO GRAB SOME COFFEE

465
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,732
BECAUSE MY ASS IS ALREADY PACKED.

466
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,520
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, RACH, LET'S GO.

467
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,788
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

468
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,756
I'M GOING TO MEET YOU UPSTAIRS IN A MINUTE.

469
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:45,607
NO.

470
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:47,609
RACHEL, YOU DIDN'T FIND ANYONE

471
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:48,811
SO YOU CAN'T TELL HIM.

472
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,012
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

473
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:51,213
THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

474
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,215
OKAY, RACHEL, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

475
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,617
HOW PAINFUL IT IS TO TELL SOMEONE THAT YOU LOVE THEM

476
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:57,619
AND NOT HAVE THEM SAY IT BACK?

477
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:02,024
I I DON'T CARE.

478
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:05,227
OKAY.

479
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,829
I I CAN'T WATCH.

480
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:23,645
WHATCHA READING?

481
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:26,048
PAPER.

482
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:27,649
YEAH? WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

483
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:33,255
EVENTS... FROM AROUND THE GLOBE.

484
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,456
OKAY.

485
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:35,257

486
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,458
UH... ROSS, YOU KNOW WHAT?

487
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,659
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I...

488
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,261
THAT I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT

489
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,663
AND EVERYBODY'S BEEN SAYING THAT I SHOULDN'T TELL YOU

490
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:43,265
BUT I I THINK THEY'RE WRONG.

491
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,267
I MEAN, YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE CAN BE WRONG.

492
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,468
SURE.

493
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:47,669
ONCE, AT WORK, I...

494
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:50,072
I THOUGHT CARBON DATING OF FOSSILIZED...

495
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:51,273
OKAY, ROSS, I'M REALLY TRYING

496
00:19:51,673 --> 00:19:52,875
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING HERE.

497
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,076
OH, UH...

498
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:54,877
YEAH.

499
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,078
OKAY.

500
00:19:56,078 --> 00:19:57,679
GO AHEAD.

501
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,881
UM... OKAY.

502
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,084
I THINK I'M I'M JUST GO... I'M JUST GOING TO SAY IT.

503
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:03,285
I'M JUST GOING TO SAY IT.

504
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,486
UH...

505
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:07,289

506
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:14,897
I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU... ROSS.

507
00:20:24,907 --> 00:20:25,707
WOW.

508
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:26,909
UH...

509
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,711
HUH, I'M I'M...

510
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:32,514
WOW, I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO DO WITH THAT RIGHT NOW.

511
00:20:32,514 --> 00:20:34,116

512
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:40,522
WH WHAT? WAS THAT A JOKE?

513
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:41,723
BECAUSE IT'S MEAN.

514
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:44,526

515
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:46,528
I'M SO DEAD SERIOUS.

516
00:20:47,729 --> 00:20:48,931
I'M TOTALLY SERIOUS.

517
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,933
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING? BECAU...

518
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,935

519
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,337
BECAUSE I JUST HEARD IT.

520
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,339
I HEARD IT AND IT'S RIDICULOUS!

521
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,540
I MEAN... YOU'RE MARRIED.

522
00:20:58,941 --> 00:21:00,943
YOU'RE MARRIED AND IT'S JUST RIDICULOUS

523
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,745
AND IT'S, LIKE... IT'S, LIKE, WHEN I SAID IT

524
00:21:04,146 --> 00:21:07,349
I JUST SORT OF, LIKE, I FLOATED UP OUT OF MY BODY, YOU KNOW

525
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:10,552
AN AND, THEN... AND, THEN, I HEARD MYSELF SAY IT

526
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:12,554
AND, THEN, THE FLOATING RACHEL...

527
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:17,359
WAS, LIKE, "YOU ARE SUCH AN IDIOT!"

528
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,965
WELL... WELL, I AM MARRIED...

529
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:24,566
I KNOW.

530
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:28,570
EVEN THOUGH I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO MY WIFE SINCE THE WEDDING.

531
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,172

532
00:21:31,773 --> 00:21:34,977
I'M SORRY, THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

533
00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:38,180
ACTUALLY, IT IT KIND OF IS.

534
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,781

535
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:43,385
MY WIFE WON'T RETURN MY CALLS.

536
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,987

537
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:47,789
I DON'T KNOW WHERE MY WIFE IS.

538
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:48,991
OH, DARN.

539
00:21:48,991 --> 00:21:50,192

540
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:53,795
"HEY, ROSS, WHERE'S THE MISSUS?"

541
00:21:54,196 --> 00:21:55,397
"DON'T KNOW."

542
00:21:55,797 --> 00:21:56,999

543
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:59,001
OH... GOD.

544
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:00,602
OH...

545
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:01,803
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

546
00:22:01,803 --> 00:22:03,805
DO YOU THINK... UH, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD

547
00:22:04,206 --> 00:22:06,208
JUST KIND OF FORGET THAT I TOLD YOU THIS?

548
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:12,214
WELL, I KIND OF HAVE TO, I MEAN, BECAUSE THE THING IS...

549
00:22:12,214 --> 00:22:13,415
WELL, THE THING IS...

550
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,817
THAT... YOU KNOW, THAT YOU'RE MARRIED TO EMILY.

551
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,622
THAT IS WHAT THE THING IS.

552
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:25,827
OH, GOD.

553
00:22:25,827 --> 00:22:27,029
THING... ROSS...

554
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,431
THINGS AREN'T GOING TO BE WEIRD BETWEEN US, RIGHT?

555
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,234

00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:02,697
WHAT? WHAT, UH, WHAT SONGS?

568
00:23:02,697 --> 00:23:04,199
OH, YOU KNOW, "WITH OR WITHOUT YOU."

OH, YEAH.

570
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,701
"EVERYBODY HURTS."

571
00:23:07,202 --> 00:23:08,203
OH... YEAH.

572
00:23:08,203 --> 00:23:09,187
"RHIANNON."

573
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,173
WH... WHY "RHIANNON"?

574
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:12,674

581
00:23:34,196 --> 00:23:36,698
BUT I'M GLAD I DID IT.

00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,683
SO, WAS I RIGHT OR WRONG?

00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,653
OH, COME ON, HONEY, DOES IT REALLY MATTER?

586
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,657

YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I CAN'T BELIEVE?

616
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,559
I HAD TO KISS PHOEBE AND RACHEL EVERY TIME I LEFT THE ROOM.

617
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,362
I MEAN, IT'S TOO BAD THEY DIDN'T SEE US HAVING SEX.

618
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:00,165
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WOMEN?

619
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,567
NO.
