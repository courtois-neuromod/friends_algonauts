1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,005
OKAY.

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,506
COME ON, AND NO PEEKING.

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:07,507
OUR EYES ARE CLOSED

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,010
AND WE'RE ABOUT TO CROSS THE STREET--

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,011
VERY GOOD.

6
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,013
OKAY... OPEN UP.

7
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,518
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SHOW US?

8
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:22,522
BECAUSE ALL I CAN SEE IS THIS BITCHING VAN!

9
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,524
YEAH. IT'S FOR OUR CATERING BUSINESS.

10
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,525
OH.

11
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,028
I THINK I KNOW THAT GIRL.

12
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,529
 ALL RIGHT. UM...

13
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,532
WE'RE NOT GOING TO REALLY KEEP IT THIS WAY, THOUGH.

14
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,533
NO?

15
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,035
WE'RE GOING TO PAINT OVER THE SWORD

16
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,537
AND REPLACE IT WITH A BAGUETTE.

17
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,039
OH, MY GOD.

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,541
I THINK I LOST MY VIRGINITY IN THAT VAN.

19
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,543
UM, ALSO, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS.

20
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,045

21
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,049
OH, YEAH.

22
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,550
I DEFINITELY KNOW HER.

36
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,598
 REMEMBER THAT GUY

37
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,600
FROM COOKING SCHOOL I TOLD YOU ABOUT

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,102
THAT PUT CILANTRO IN EVERYTHING?

39
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,104
OH, SURE. "CILANTRO" LARRY.

40
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,606
WELL, I'M GOING TO FILL IN FOR HIM

41
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,109
AS FOOD CRITIC FOR THE CHELSEA REPORTER.

42
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,612
WOW! MONICA, WHAT AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY

43
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,115
TO INFLUENCE... DOZENS OF PEOPLE.

44
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,617
 HOW COULD YOU HAVE SAID YES?

45
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,120
WHAT ABOUT OUR CATERING BUSINESS?

46
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,122
OH, NO, NO. IT'S JUST ONE NIGHT A WEEK.

47
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,123
I GET TO TAKE ALL OF YOU OUT

48
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,624
FOR A LOT OF FREE DINNERS.

49
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,126
HEY. HEY.

50
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,627
OH, WELL, IN THAT CASE...

51
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,629
HEY.

52
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,632
THAT WAS ME HOPPING ON BOARD.

53
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,633
OH.

54
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,135
HEY, GUYS.

55
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,138
HEY, ROSS, QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU.

56
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,640
ARE YOU READY TO PARTY?

57
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,142
I DON'T KNOW.

58
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,644
I COULD MAYBE GO OUT FOR A COUPLE OF BEERS

59
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,147
BUT THERE'S THIS THING ABOUT BUMBLEBEES

60
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,648
ON THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL...

61
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,651
NO, NO, NO. I DON'T THINK YOU HEARD ME.

62
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,154
ARE YOU READY... TO PARTY?

63
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,156
NO!

64
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,158
GANDALF?!

65
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,659
GANDALF IS COMING TO TOWN?

66
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,660
KATHY'S WITH HER PARENTS.

67
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,162
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO.

68
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,664
TOMORROW, WE ARE PARTYING WITH GANDALF, DUDE!

69
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,168
DUDE, WE ARE SO GOING TO PARTY.

70
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,169
YEAH!

71
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,671
WOW! OKAY. DUDE ALERT.

72
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,175
AND WHO IS THIS GUY?

73
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,176
MIKE "GANDALF" GANDERSON.

74
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,678
ONLY, LIKE, THE FUNNEST GUY IN THE WORLD.

75
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,181
I'M GOING TO CALL AND GET OFF WORK TOMORROW.

76
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,183
I'M GOING TO CALL AFTER YOU!

77
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,186
THIS IS GOING TO BE SO COOL, DUDE.

78
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,687
WE NEVER PARTY ANYMORE.

79
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,690
OOOOOOH! OOOOOOH!

80
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,193
WERE YOU GUYS SMOKING SOMETHING

81
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,195
IN THE BACK OF OUR VAN?

82
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,697
REALLY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WE NEVER HAVE FUN ANYMORE?

83
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,199
YOU HAVE FUN WITH ME.

84
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,201
REMEMBER THE TIME WE SAW THOSE STRIPPERS

85
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,702
AND YOU PAID ME 50 BUCKS

86
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,704
TO EAT THAT BOOK?

87
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,706
JOEY, YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS GUY.

88
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,708
GANDALF IS, LIKE, THE PARTY WIZARD.

89
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,710
WHY DO YOU CALL HIM GANDALF?

90
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,712
GANDALF THE WIZARD.

91
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,217
HELLO. DIDN'T YOU READ LORD OF THE RINGS

92
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,718
IN HIGH SCHOOL?

93
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,720
NO, I HAD SEX

94
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,222
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

95
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,227
OH, UH... JOANNA?

96
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,728
I WAS WONDERING

97
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,231
IF I COULD ASK YOU SOMETHING.

98
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,233
THERE'S AN OPENING FOR AN ASSISTANT BUYER

99
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,734
IN JUNIOR MISS...

100
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,236
THAT WOULD BE A STEP DOWN FOR ME.

101
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,738
NO, ACTUALLY, I MEANT FOR ME.

102
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,741
THE HIRING COMMITTEE IS MEETING PEOPLE ALL DAY.

103
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,743
OH. WELL, I WISH I COULD SAY NO

104
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,746
BUT I GUESS YOU CAN'T STAY MY ASSISTANT FOREVER.

105
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,748
NEITHER CAN YOU, SOPHIE

106
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,251
BUT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS.

107
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,253
I'M SO GLAD YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS

108
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,754
BECAUSE IF YOU DID

109
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,256
I WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE CONSIDERED APPLYING.

110
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,757
REALLY? IN THAT CASE...

111
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,759
THAT'S WHY I'M SO GLAD THERE'S NO PROBLEM.

112
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,262
IT'S FINE. ACTUALLY, I'M ON THE HIRING COMMITTEE

113
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,764
SO THERE'LL BE AT LEAST ONE FRIENDLY FACE.

114
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,765
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

115
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,767
JUNIOR MISS IS WHERE I STARTED.

116
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,768
REALLY?

117
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,271
HAD TO SLEEP WITH THE UGLIEST GUY

118
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,772
TO GET THAT JOB.

119
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,773
OH... REALLY?

120
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,276
NO!

121
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,777
YEAH.

122
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,780
I MEAN, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

123
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,282
DON'T YOU WORRY.

124
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,783
WITH YOUR QUALIFICATIONS

125
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,785
YOU WON'T NEED TO SLEEP WITH SOME GUY

126
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,287
TO GET THE JOB.

127
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,288
ALTHOUGH I MIGHT NEED

128
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,289
SOME CONVINCING.

129
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,292
WELL, UM...

130
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,793
KIDDING!

131
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,296

132
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,298
GOD, I FEEL WILD TODAY!

133
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,804
OH, MAN, I AM SO EXCITED

134
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,806
I MAY VOMIT.

135
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,808
WILL YOU CALM DOWN?

136
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,311
HE'S JUST A HUMAN GUY.

137
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,313
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. GANDALF IS AMAZING.

138
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,315
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT WILL END UP HAPPENING.

139
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,317
YOU GO OUT FOR A COUPLE OF BEERS

140
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,819
AND END UP ON A FISHING BOAT TO NOVA SCOTIA.

141
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,321
REALLY?

142
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,323
OH, YEAH. IT'S BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY UP THERE.

143
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,327
HEY! OKAY, I GOT MY PASSPORT

144
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,828
FRESH SOCKS

145
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,830
AND A SNAKEBITE KIT.

146
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,833
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EXACTLY LIKE LAST TIME.

147
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,335
 ALL RIGHT

148
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,836
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS.

149
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,837
WHOA, WHOA. WHOA, WHOA.

150
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,339
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

151
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,841
I HAVE AN AUDITION. I'LL HOOK UP WITH YOU LATER.

152
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,343
WHERE WILL YOU BE AROUND NOON?

153
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,846
SOMEWHERE MAYBE ALONG THE EQUATOR.

154
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,348

155
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,350
OKAY.

156
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,352

157
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,853
HELLO.

158
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,355
IT'S GANDALF!

159
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,357
OOOOOOH! OOOOOOH!

160
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,359
SO, YOU IN TOWN?

161
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,364
OH. WELL...

162
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,865
WELL, MAYBE NEXT TIME THEN.

163
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,367
WHAT HAPPENED?

164
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,868
HE'S NOT GOING TO MAKE IT.

165
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,870
HE'S STUCK IN CHICAGO.

166
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,872
OH, MAN!

167
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,375
CHICAGO'S SO LUCKY.

168
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,877
STUPID, USELESS

169
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,379
CANADIAN MONEY!

170
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,388
YOU HAVE A VERY IMPRESSIVE RESUME, MS. GREEN.

171
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,390
I ESPECIALLY LIKE WHAT I SEE HERE

172
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,892
ABOUT IMPLEMENTING A NEW FILING SYSTEM.

173
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,394
THANK YOU.

174
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,395
FILING SYSTEM?

175
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,397
YOU MEAN THOSE LITTLE COLORED LABELS

176
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,898
YOU PUT ON ALL THE FOLDERS?

177
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,401
IT BRIGHTENED UP THE INSIDE OF THE FILING CABINETS.

178
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,404
WELL, THEY, UH... THEY...

179
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,906
THEY DID MORE THAN THAT.

180
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,908
I NOTICE THAT YOU'VE BEEN ENTRUSTED

181
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,911
WITH A LOT OF RATHER IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITIES.

182
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:56,416
YES. JOANNA REALLY HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE MENTOR TO ME.

183
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,917
RACHEL HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE

184
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,919
AT GETTING MY MORNING BAGEL FOR ME.

185
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,922
IT'S AMAZING HOW SHE GETS IT RIGHT ALMOST EVERYTIME.

186
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,424
I... I... OF COURSE...

187
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,427
I HAVE MORE RESPONSIBILITIES THAN THAT.

188
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,429
OF COURSE. WELL, THERE'S THE COFFEE, TOO.

189
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,932
RACHEL CAN CARRY TWO THINGS AT ONCE.

190
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,934
THAT'S... THAT'S VERY GOOD.

191
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,436
NOW...

192
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,438
A, UH...

193
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,939
BIG PART OF THIS JOB

194
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,941
IS CULTIVATING PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS

195
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,943
ESPECIALLY WITH DESIGNERS.

196
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,446
RACHEL SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM. YES, I REALIZE THAT.

197
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,947
HER ONLY PROBLEM

198
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,950
MIGHT BE GETTING TOO FRIENDLY, IF  YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

199
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,453
I LOVE WORKING WITH DESIGNERS.

200
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,455
WITH THEM, UNDER THEM.

201
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,457
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE, EH, RACH?

202
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,464
HEY, MY FIRST REVIEW IS OUT.

203
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,966
OH! OH, THE CHELSEA REPORTER.

204
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,470
OH, THESE USED TO KEEP ME SO WARM.

205
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,972
RIGHT. LOOK, I'M ON THE BACK PAGE.

206
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,474
OH! OKAY.

207
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,975
"WOULD I GO BACK TO ALESSANDRO'S?

208
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,478
"SURE. BUT I'D HAVE TO ORDER TWO MEALS--

209
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,480
"ONE FOR ME AND ONE FOR THE GUY

210
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,981
POINTING THE GUN TO MY HEAD."

211
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,984
WOW! YOU REALLY LAID INTO THIS PLACE.

212
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,987
THEY DON'T PAY ME A PENNY A WORD TO MAKE FRIENDS.

213
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,989
I GOT TO GO. I FOUND A GUY

214
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,991
WHO CAN FIX UP THE VAN FOR CATERING.

215
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,992
WANT ME TO GO WITH YOU?

216
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,494
NO. NO. IT'S OKAY.

217
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,496
BUT ARE WE SURE WE DON'T WANT THE WATERBED?

218
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,498
JUST BECAUSE IT WOULD

219
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,999
BE SILLY TO TAKE IT OUT

220
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,502
IF WE'RE JUST GOING TO PUT IT BACK IN AGAIN.

221
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,505
HAVEN'T WE MADE THIS DECISION?

222
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,506
YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

223
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,009
BYE. BYE.

224
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,013

225
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,517
WHO IS IT?

226
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,519
It's Alessandro, from Alessandro's.

227
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,522
OH, MY GOD.

228
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,525
I want to talk to you about your review.

229
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,026
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

230
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,028
CALL ME ON THE PHONE.

231
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,030
What, so you can hang up on me?

232
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,032
LOOK. I'M NEVER GOING TO LET YOU UP

233
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,034
SO YOU MAY AS WELL JUST GO AWAY.

234
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,536
Give me a chance to...

235
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,538
 You need to get in? Here you go.

236
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,039
NO, PHOEBE!

237
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,541
Hey, Monica.

238
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,049
I WANT A RETRACTION.

239
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,552
OUR FOOD IS NOT INEDIBLE SWILL!

240
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,553
I COULDN'T EAT IT.

241
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,055
I HAVE FIVE FRIENDS WHO COULDN'T EAT IT

242
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,557
AND ONE OF THEM EATS BOOKS.

243
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:21,060
WELL, OUR SERVICE IS NOT GROSSLY INCOMPETENT.

244
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,063
THE WAITER CARRIED THE BREADSTICKS IN HIS PANTS.

245
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:29,068
WELL... YOU SAID THAT WE ACCEPT THE DISCOVER CARD

246
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,071
WHICH WE DO NOT.

247
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,575
ALL RIGHT. THAT I'LL RETRACT, BUT I STAND BY MY REVIEW.

248
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,077
I KNOW FOOD, AND THAT WASN'T IT.

249
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,580
YOUR MARINARA SAUCE TASTES LIKE TOMATO JUICE.

250
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,582
YOU SHOULD SERVE IT WITH VODKA

251
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,083
AND A PIECE OF CELERY.

252
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,085
I'M PROUD OF THAT SAUCE. IT'S DELICIOUS.

253
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,087
OH, MY GOD!

254
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,590
YOU OWN AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT AND YOU THINK THAT TASTES GOOD?

255
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,091
WHERE ARE YOU EVEN FROM?

256
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,095
LEBANON.

257
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,597
HAND ME THOSE TOMATOES.

258
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,099
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT IT SHOULD TASTE LIKE.

259
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,602
COME ON. HAND THEM TO ME.

260
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,104
HOW LONG IS THIS GOING TO TAKE, BECAUSE I GOT

261
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,106
ANOTHER CRITIC I GOT TO GO YELL AT.

262
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,613
UH, JOANNA?

263
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,615
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT INTERVIEW.

264
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,117
I THOUGHT IT WENT VERY WELL.

265
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,620
NO, IT DIDN'T.

266
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,122
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

267
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,125
NOW, JUST TO BRIEF YOU...

268
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,129
I MAY CRY

269
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,633
BUT THEY ARE NOT TEARS OF SADNESS

270
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,635
OR OF ANGER

271
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,137
BUT JUST OF ME HAVING THIS DISCUSSION WITH YOU.

272
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,639
RACHEL, PLEASE.

273
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,140
DON'T MAKE A SCENE.

274
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,643
THERE'S NOBODY HERE.

275
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,144
SOPHIE, GET IN HERE!

276
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,649
YOU SEE? YOU'RE MAKING SOPHIE UNCOMFORTABLE.

277
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,652
SHE'S NOT MAKING ME UNCOMFORTABLE.

278
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,155
CONGRATULATIONS. YOU CROSSED THE LINE INTO COMPLETELY USELESS.

279
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,658
GET OUT.

280
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,660
DO YOU WANT ME TO QUIT?

281
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,161
WHAT?

282
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,663
WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU THINK THAT?

283
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,666
WELL, ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU SAID IN THE INTERVIEW.

284
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,167
IF YOU BELIEVE ANY OF THEM

285
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,670
I MUST NOT BE A VERY GOOD ASSISTANT.

286
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,673
YOU KNOW WHAT?

287
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,677
I AM JUST GOING TO PACK UP MY DESK...

288
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,678

289
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,681
AND I WILL BE GONE BY THE END OF THE DAY.

290
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,685
WELL, I GUESS THERE'S NO USE

291
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,688
ME STICKING AROUND TILL THE END OF THE DAY.

292
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,190
ALL RIGHT. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

293
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,192
YOU CAN PUT YOUR SAD LITTLE MUFFIN

294
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,694
BACK IN ITS DRAWER.

295
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,196
IF YOU MUST KNOW THE TRUTH

296
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,199
I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE A PERFECTLY GOOD ASSISTANT.

297
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,701
WHAT?

298
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,703
THAT'S WHY I SAID ALL THOSE THINGS

299
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,205
ABOUT YOUR FLIRTING AND YOUR DRINKING.

300
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,207
MY DRINKING?

301
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,210
OH. I MUST HAVE SAID THAT AFTER YOU LEFT.

302
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,714
SAID WHAT, EXACTLY?

303
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,717
YOU ENJOY THE OCCASIONAL DRINK...ING BINGE.

304
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,719

305
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,720
OH, MY GOD!

306
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,222
OH! THAT IS IT! I AM LEAVING!

307
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,724
YOU ARE JUST A HORRIBLE PERSON.

308
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,726
NO, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

309
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,228
IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET ALL SENSITIVE ABOUT IT.

310
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,730
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU.

311
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,733
WHAT IF I CREATE A POSITION FOR YOU?

312
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,736
I'LL MAKE YOU ASSISTANT BUYER IN THIS DEPARTMENT.

313
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,238
SAY MORE THINGS LIKE THAT.

314
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,240
UM...

315
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,742
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN OFFICE

316
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,744
AND A RAISE, EFFECTIVE TOMORROW.

317
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,245
I'D NEED AN EXPENSE ACCOUNT.

318
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,747
DONE.

319
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,248
AND AN ASSISTANT.

320
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,250
SOPHIE, GET IN HERE.

321
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,254
However, it seems like a lifetime, doesn't it?

322
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,757
Starting when Stefano used Kristin...

323
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,759
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

324
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,762
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE OUT PARTYING WITH GAN...DORF.

325
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,263
IT'S GANDALF

326
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,766
AND HE'S NOT COMING.

327
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,768
SO YOU BEEN SITTING AROUND ALL MORNING?

328
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,269
NO.

329
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,772
I BALANCED MY CHECKBOOK.

330
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,774
YEAH, AND I GAVE FIRST NAMES

331
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,776
TO ALL THE FOOSBALL PLAYERS.

332
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,780
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE DIDN'T COME.

333
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,281
SO WHAT IF HE DIDN'T COME?

334
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,283
WE CAN GO OUT AND PARTY OURSELVES.

335
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,785
OH, NO.

336
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,287
YOU KNOW, WITH GANDALF, WE'D BE OUT ALL NIGHT.

337
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,789
YEAH. WE'D MEET...

338
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,792
WE'D MEET TOTAL STRANGERS AND HANG OUT WITH THEM.

339
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,293
WELL, WE COULD DO THAT.

340
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,796
THERE WAS OTHER STUFF, TOO.

341
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,798
WE'LL DO IT ALL, AND BETTER.

342
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,800
LOOK, AFTER TONIGHT

343
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,801
GANDALF WILL WANT

344
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,804
TO PARTY WITH US, DUDE. COME ON!

345
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,305
YEAH! YEAH!

346
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,308
YEAH! IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO PARTY.

347
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,310
YEAH! ALL RIGHT! LET'S GO!

348
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,312
MAYBE WE COULD END UP ON A BOAT AGAIN?

349
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,313
YEAH! YEAH!

350
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,314
WELL, ALL RIGHT!

351
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,816
YEAH!

352
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,817
HEY, HEY, HEY.

353
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,819
WHEN, UH... WHEN WERE WE ON A BOAT?

354
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,821
REMEMBER THAT REALLY COLD MORNING

355
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,324
WHEN YOU WOKE UP AND THOSE DOGS WERE LICKING YOUR FACE?

356
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,826
YEAH.

357
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,327
THOSE WERE SEALS, MAN.

358
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,834
HEY, HOW DO YOU THINK

359
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,336
THIS SUIT WOULD LOOK ON AN ASSISTANT...?

360
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,839
THE OWNER OF ALESSANDRO'S CAME OVER TO YELL AT ME

361
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,842
BUT I MADE HIM SOME SAUCE, AND HE OFFERED ME THE JOB

362
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,843
AS HEAD CHEF.

363
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,344
OH, MY GOD! YOU JUST RUINED

364
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,346
WHAT I WAS PRACTICING THE WHOLE WAY HOME

365
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:08,347
BUT I'M SO HAPPY!

366
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,349
I KNOW! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

367
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,351
I FINALLY GET TO RUN MY OWN KITCHEN.

368
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,354
OH, YOU'VE WAITED SO LONG. AW...

369
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,355
HEY.

370
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,357
HEY, PHEEBS, QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU:

371
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,359
HOW DO YOU THINK THIS SUIT WOULD LOOK

372
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,862
ON AN ASSISTANT BUYER AT BLOOMINGDALE'S?

373
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:23,863
I DON'T KNOW.

374
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,865
IT WOULD TOTALLY DEPEND

375
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,366
ON HER COLORING, AND...

376
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,868
YOU GOT THE JOB!

377
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,870
YOU GOT THE JOB?!

378
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,871
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

379
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,375
OH, IT'S GOING TO BE SO GREAT!

380
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,377
I'M GOING TO GET TO HELP DECIDE

381
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,378
WHAT WE SELL

382
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,880
AND I'M GOING TO HAVE AN OFFICE

383
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,882
WITH WALLS AND EVERYTHING.

384
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,383
I'M GOING TO HAVE WALLS!

385
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,886
OKAY. IS THIS THE DAY OF GOOD NEWS OR WHAT?

386
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,888
I GOT US A JOB-- THE WEDDING RECEPTION.

387
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,389

388
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,390
OH! UM...

389
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,393
PHOEBE, I KIND OF NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

390
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,394

391
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,900
UM... WELL, I I I THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR ME

392
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,903
TO TAKE A STEP BACK FROM THE CATERING.

393
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,404
BUT WE'VE ONLY HAD ONE JOB.

394
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,907
I KNOW, BUT NOW WE HAVE THIS SECOND ONE

395
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,410
AND IT JUST... IT FEELS LIKE IT'S SNOWBALLING, YOU KNOW?

396
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,413
YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

397
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,416
I GOT OFFERED THE HEAD CHEF JOB AT ALESSANDRO'S.

398
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,417
WHAT?

399
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,419
IT'S OKAY. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT

400
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,421
YOU DON'T REALLY NEED ME

401
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,422
FOR THE BUSINESS.

402
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,423
YOU'RE THE COOK!

403
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,925
WITHOUT YOU, IT'S JUST ME

404
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,928
DRIVING UP TO PEOPLE'S HOUSES WITH EMPTY TRAYS

405
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,429
AND ASKING FOR MONEY.

406
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,935
ALL RIGHT, BUT, UM...

407
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,938
WELL, I'LL I'LL PAY YOU BACK ALL THE MONEY YOU INVESTED

408
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,940
AND YOU CAN KEEP THE VAN.

409
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,441
FOR WHAT?

410
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,444
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

411
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,946
I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

412
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,447
OH, PHOEBE, WAIT A MINUTE.

413
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,453
I'M AN ASSISTANT BUYER!

414
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,960
WE'LL GET A LITTLE COFFEE

415
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,462
GET ENERGIZED, AND WE'LL HEAD BACK OUT.

416
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,463
YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

417
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,464
OKAY.

418
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,970
SO, WE'RE HAVING FUN, RIGHT?

419
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,471
WE DON'T NEED THAT WIZARD GUY.

420
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,474
WE HIT A COUPLE OF CLUBS, TALKED TO SOME STRANGERS

421
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,976
AND, AFTER THIS

422
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,979
WE'LL GO DOWN TO THE DOCKS AND SEE ABOUT THAT BOAT THING.

423
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,483
I'M KIND OF BEAT.

424
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,486
ACTUALLY... ME, TOO.

425
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:28,988
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

426
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:29,989
YEAH. YEAH.

427
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,991
THANK GOD. I'M EXHAUSTED.

428
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,493

429
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,995
SO, YOU GUYS WANT COFFEES?

430
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,997
YEAH, BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE UP TOO LATE

431
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:38,998
SO I'LL HAVE A DECAF.

432
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,000
YEAH. ME, TOO.

433
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,501
ACTUALLY, COULD I GET

434
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,004
SOME HOT WATER WITH A LITTLE LEMON?

435
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,006
I THINK I STRAINED MY VOICE

436
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,507
SCREAMING IN THERE.

437
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,509
DOES IT HAVE TO BE SO LOUD?

438
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,511
OH, I CAN'T HEAR A WORD YOU'RE SAYING

439
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,013
MY EARS ARE RINGING SO BAD.

440
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,514
I'M JUST GLAD I BROUGHT

441
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,516
THAT EXTRA PAIR OF SOCKS, YOU KNOW?

442
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,018
I USED THEM AS MITTENS.

443
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,519
I DIDN'T WANT TO TOUCH A THING

444
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,021
IN THAT LAST PLACE.

445
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,527
HOW SAD ARE WE?

446
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,029
YEAH. I KNOW.

447
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,531
YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'RE NOT SAD.

448
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,532
WE'RE NOT SAD.

449
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,534
WE'RE JUST NOT 21 ANYMORE, YOU KNOW?

450
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,036
I'M 29 YEARS OLD, DAMN IT

451
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,038
AND I WANT TO SIT IN A COMFORTABLE CHAIR

452
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,039
AND WATCH TELEVISION

453
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,041
AND GO TO SLEEP AT A REASONABLE HOUR.

454
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,042
YEAH. YEAH.

455
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,043
YEAH, AND I LIKE

456
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,544
TO HANG OUT IN A QUIET PLACE

457
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,546
WHERE I CAN TALK TO MY FRIENDS.

458
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,547
YEAH. YEAH.

459
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,549
AND SO WHAT IF I LIKE TO GO HOME

460
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,551
THROW ON SOME KENNY G

461
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,053
AND TAKE A BATH?

462
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,058
WE'RE 29, WE'RE NOT WOMEN.

463
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,567
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

464
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,070
OKAY. I'M I'M GLAD

465
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,072
THAT YOU DECIDED TO HEAR ME OUT.

466
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,573
OKAY. I'M HEARING.

467
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,077
OKAY. I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF THINKING-- A LOT--

468
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,080
AND, WELL, I CAME UP WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF BUSINESSES

469
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,082
THAT YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR VAN.

470
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,586
OKAY. UM... YOU COULD BE A FLOWER DELIVERY PERSON.

471
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,587
WHAT?

472
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,588
OR...

473
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,090
A BAKERY DELIVERY PERSON?

474
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,091

475
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,092
PIZZA?

476
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,095
MONICA!

477
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,098
ALL RIGHT. I'VE GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF IN THIS AREA

478
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,599
BUT I'M GETTING THE FEELING

479
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,601
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DELIVER.

480
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,103
NO.

481
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,104
OKAY.

482
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,608
I'M GUESSING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DELIVER

483
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,611
YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO PICK UP STUFF EITHER.

484
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,613
NO.

485
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,120
YOU KNOW WHAT?

486
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,621
LET'S DO THE CATERING BUSINESS.

487
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,123
REALLY? ARE YOU SURE?

488
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,125
YEAH. YOU KNOW, I I...

489
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,127
I MADE A COMMITMENT TO YOU, AND...

490
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,628
YOU KNOW, IT'D IT'D BE FUN.

491
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,630
OH, IT WILL BE FUN!

492
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,632
OH, YAY!

493
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,634
OKAY. LET'S PLAN THE WEDDING RECEPTION.

494
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:56,635
OKAY.

495
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,137

496
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,640
WOW.

497
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,643
YOU REALLY WANTED ME

498
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,645
TO DO SOMETHING WITH THIS VAN.

499
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,151
YOU KNOW WHAT?

500
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,153
I WANT YOU TO TAKE THE CHEF JOB.

501
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,654
REALLY?

502
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,655
YEAH.

503
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,657
THAT'S WHAT YOU REALLY WANT.

504
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,660
YEAH. I DON'T WANT TO BE THE REASON YOU'RE UNHAPPY.

505
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,162
THAT WOULD JUST MAKE ME UNHAPPY

506
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,164
AND I REALLY DON'T WANT TO BE

507
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,166
THE REASON I'M UNHAPPY.

508
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,167
THANK YOU.

509
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,671
BESIDES, IT MIGHT BE KIND OF FUN

510
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,173
TO FORM THE NEW A TEAM.

511
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,184
 OH, HI, MRS. LYNCH.

512
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,186
IS JOANNA IN ALREADY?

513
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,688
OH, MY GOODNESS. YOU HAVEN'T HEARD.

514
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,190
HEARD WHAT?

515
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,693
JOANNA... PASSED AWAY LAST NIGHT.

516
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,696
OH, MY GOD! HOW?

517
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,699
SHE WAS LEAVING WORK, AND SHE WAS HIT BY A CAB.

518
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,201
OH, MY GOD!

519
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,702
OH, I CANNOT BELIEVE IT.

520
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,204
OH, I KNOW.

521
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,707
OH, GOD. OH, GOD...

522
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,710
OH, GOD.

523
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,714
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT YOU WERE SO CLOSE.

524
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,717
YES... SO CLOSE.

525
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,722
MRS. LYNCH, I KNOW THAT THIS IS AN EMOTIONAL

526
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,226
AND DIFFICULT TIME FOR ALL OF US...

527
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:31,230
BUT BY ANY CHANCE DID JOANNA SEND ANY PAPERWORK YOUR WAY

528
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,233
BEFORE... IT HAPPENED?

529
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,735
NO. NOTHING.

530
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,237
IMAGINE...

531
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,239
IF SHE'D JUST STEPPED OFF THAT CURB

532
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,740
A FEW SECONDS LATER.

533
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,742
OH, YES, YES.

534
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,745
JUST A FEW SECONDS AND SHE'D STILL BE WITH US.

535
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,748
NOTHING ABOUT AN ASSISTANT BUYER OR...?

536
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,749
I'M SORRY.

537
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,251
I HAVE TO GO.

538
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,253

539
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,754
GOOD MORNING.

540
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,256
OH, SOPHIE, I GUESS

541
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,757
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT JOANNA.

542
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,759
I SURE DID.

543
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,266
I'M SO EXCITED

544
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,269
ABOUT HAVING MONICA COME ON BOARD WITH US

545
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,772
ALTHOUGH I DO FEEL BAD ABOUT HAVING FIRED CHEF EMILIO.

546
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,775
IT IS LIKE LOSING A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY.

547
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,278
OF COURSE, THAT LITERALLY IS THE CASE

548
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,279
FOR SEVERAL OF YOU.

549
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:26,285
TONY, CARLOS, MARIE, PLEASE, TELL YOUR FATHER

550
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,787
HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO MISS HIM.

551
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,789
NOW, I KNOW THAT MONICA

552
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,793
HAS A LOT OF GREAT IDEAS FOR THIS PLACE--

553
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,796
WELL, YOU ALL READ THE REVIEW--

554
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,299
SO, WITHOUT MUCH FURTHER ADO

555
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:44,803
I PRESENT TO YOU OUR NEW HEAD CHEF.

556
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:55,314
UM, I JUST WANT TO SAY, UH, THAT WITH A PINCH OF EXCITEMENT

557
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,817
A DASH OF HARD WORK AND A DOLLOP OF COOPERATION

558
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,320
WE CAN HAVE THE RECIPE...

559
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,825
ARE YOU GOING TO KILL ME?
