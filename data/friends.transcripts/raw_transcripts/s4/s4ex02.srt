1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,507
WOW, THAT RIPPED.

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,011
THAT RIPPED REAL NICE.

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,513
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU--

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,015
YOU TURN AND SLIDE?

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
YOU KNOW? TURN AND SLIDE.

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,519
YOU DON'T TURN AND SLIDE.

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,521
YOU THROW IT OUT.

8
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,023
I'M TIRED OF HAVING

9
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,026
TO GET A TETANUS SHOT EVERY TIME I GET DRESSED.

10
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,028
WELL, WE'RE NOT THROWING IT OUT.

11
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,030
I BUILT THIS THING WITH MY OWN HANDS.

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,032
ALL RIGHT. HOW ABOUT WE...

13
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,533
HOW ABOUT WE SELL IT?

14
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,036
ALL RIGHT.

15
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,538
BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

16
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,040
TO TELL THEM.

17
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,045
YOU MIND IF WE STICK YOU IN A DIFFERENT CABINET?

18
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,047
THEY SEEM ALL RIGHT WITH IT.

31
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,598
WHY DID THE CHICKEN FALL OUT OF THE TREE?

32
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,100
WHY?

33
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,602
BECAUSE YOU HAVE DOODY ON YOUR HEAD.

34
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,604

35
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,606
IT WAS FUNNIER WHEN BEN TOLD IT.

36
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,112
Hey, Monica. It's Chip.

37
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,113
YES!

38
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,114
WHO'S CHIP?

39
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,115
SHH!

40
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,117
It was good running into you

41
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,620
at the bank today, so here's my number-- 555-9323.

42
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,621
Give me a call. Later.

43
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,123
"CHIP" IS CHIP MATTHEWS.

44
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,625
THE GUY WHO TOOK RACHEL TO THE PROM?

45
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,127
WHY IS HE CALLING YOU?

46
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,629
BECAUSE I RAN INTO HIM AT THE BANK.

47
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,131
HE IS STILL SO CUTE.

48
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,632
MONICA, YOU'RE SO LUCKY.

49
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,134
HE'S, LIKE, THE MOST POPULAR GUY

50
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,635
IN SCHOOL.

51
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,137
YEAH, I KNOW.

52
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,139
CHIP?

53
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,641
HI. IT'S MONICA.

54
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,644
OKAY.

55
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,147
OKAY.

56
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,650
OKAY.

57
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,152
OKAY. GOOD BYE.

58
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,655
OH, MY GOD, WE JUST HAD THE BEST CONVERSATION.

59
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,662
I WAS JUST LEAVING.

60
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,664
GOOD, BECAUSE I'VE GOT

61
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,666
A PRODUCT REPORT TO READ.

62
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,168
IT'S, LIKE, EIGHT PAGES.

63
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,170
I HOPE I DON'T FALL ASLEEP.

64
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,172
WHY? DID YOU WRITE IT?

65
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,675
WELL, HELLO.

66
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,678
LOOK AT THAT.

67
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,180
CHIP MATTHEWS CALLED.

68
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,681
WONDER WHAT HE WANTS.

69
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,684
WELL, UH, ACTUALLY...

70
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:09,689
I BET HE SENSED THAT I WAS READY TO HAVE SEX WITH ANOTHER GUY.

71
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,695
WELL, UM...

72
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,698
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE HIM A CALL?

73
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,706
OKAY.

74
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,210

75
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,712
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO HEAR THIS?

76
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,714
OH, I'M SURE.

77
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,217
CHIP.

78
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,219
HI. IT'S RACHEL.

79
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,221
RACHEL GREEN.

80
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,225
YEAH. UM, YOU LEFT ME A MESSAGE?

81
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,726
YES, YOU DID.

82
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,728
MY ROOMMATE WROTE IT DOWN.

83
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,731
MONICA GELLER.

84
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,736
OH.

85
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,240
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

86
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,746
HE CALLED TO ASK OUT MONICA.

87
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:10,250
OHH. THAT'S-- THAT'S GOT TO BE EMBARRASSING.

88
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,758
?
?? ...DUMB, DRUNKEN BITCH! ?

89
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,762

90
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,763
THANK YOU.

91
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,266
THANKS.

92
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,268
NOW, HERE'S A QUESTION.

93
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,270
WHERE'D YOU GUYS GET "THE FINEST OAK

94
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,272
EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI"?

95
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,274
FIRST YOU TELL US WHERE YOU GOT

96
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,276
THE PRETTIEST LACE IN ALL THE LAND.

97
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,278
I'M READING YOUR AD.

98
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,779
LOOKS GOOD, HUH?

99
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,281
YEAH.

100
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,783
"STUNNING ENTERTAINMENT CENTER. FINE..."

101
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,287
"FINE ITALIAN CRAFTSMANSHIP."

102
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,290
OH, MY GOD.

103
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,292
YOU GUYS ARE SELLING THE ENTERTAINMENT CENTER?

104
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,793
WHY? I LOVE THAT THING.

105
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,794
YOU WANT IT?

106
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,297
EWW! NO!

107
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,299
UH, GEPPETTO?

108
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,303
5,000 DOLLAR?

109
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,804
ARE YOU INSANE?

110
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,307
HEY, THE AD ALONE COST 300 BUCKS.

111
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,808
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

112
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,811
I'M CHANGING IT TO "$50 DOLLAR OR YOUR BEST OFFER."

113
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,315
WHAT KIND OF PROFIT IS THAT?

114
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,817
AND YOU CALL YOURSELF AN ACCOUNTANT?

115
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,820
NO.

116
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,824
OH.

117
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,327
WHAT DO YOU DO?

118
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,829
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DON'T KNOW

119
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,831
WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING.

120
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,833
I DON'T. SOMETHING TO DO WITH...?

121
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,337
OH, MY GOD! NO!

122
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,339
SHOO! KITTY? NO!

123
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,341
NO! GUNTHER...

124
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,343
GUNTHER, THERE'S A KITTY IN MY GUITAR CASE.

125
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,345
SHH! EVERYONE'S GOING TO WANT ONE.

126
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,348
COME ON, YOU.

127
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,349
COME ON.

128
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,850
YOU'RE CRAZY.

129
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,852
OH, MY GOD.

130
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,854
WHAT?

131
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,357
NOTHING. NOTHING.

132
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,858
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

133
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,360
I JUST...

134
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,365
I JUST HAVE THIS REALLY STRONG FEELING THAT...

135
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,866
THIS CAT IS MY MOTHER.

136
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,869
YOU MEAN THE MOM YOU MET IN MONTAUK?

137
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:10,870
SHE WAS A CAT?

138
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,372
THAT MAKES THE FACT

139
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,873
THAT SHE OWNS BEACH FRONT PROPERTY

140
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,375
ALL THE MORE IMPRESSIVE.

141
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,876
NO, NO, NO.

142
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,378
SHE WAS A HUMAN LADY.

143
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,880
THIS IS THE SPIRIT  OF MY MOM, LILY--

144
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,382
THE ONE THAT KILLED HERSELF.

145
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,385
ARE YOU SURE SHE'S IN THE CAT, OR HAVE YOU BEEN TAKING

146
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,387
YOUR GRANDMA'S GLAUCOMA MEDICINE AGAIN?

147
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,889
NO, DR. SKEPTISMO.

148
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,892
I'M SURE.

149
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,894
FIRST OF ALL, OKAY, THERE'S THE FEELING.

150
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,396
OKAY, AND FOR ANOTHER

151
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:40,400
HOW ABOUT THE FACT THAT SHE WENT INTO MY GUITAR CASE?

152
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,902
WHICH IS LINED WITH ORANGE FELT.

153
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,908
MY MOTHER'S FAVORITE FISH WAS ORANGEROUGHY.

154
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,415
CATS LIKE FISH.

155
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,919
YOU HAD ME WITH ORANGE FELT.

156
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,423
HI, MOMMY.

157
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,925
OH! I HAVEN'T SEEN

158
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,429
THIS SMILE IN 17 YEARS.

159
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,433
DUDE, PHOEBE'S MOM'S GOT A HUGE PAIR...

160
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,435
LET IT GO!

161
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,938
HEY.

162
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,441
UM, WHEN WERE YOU GOING TO TELL ME

163
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,943
THAT YOU'RE GOING OUT WITH CHIP MATTHEWS?

164
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,945
NOW.

165
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,449
IS IT OKAY IF I GO OUT WITH CHIP MATTHEWS?

166
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,950
NO, IT'S NOT OKAY.

167
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,452
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD WANT TO

168
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,953
AFTER WHAT HE DID TO ME.

169
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,955
WHAT? THAT LITTLE THING AT THE PROM?

170
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,958
MONICA, I COULDN'T FIND HIM FOR TWO HOURS.

171
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,960
HE WAS HAVING SEX WITH AMY WELSH.

172
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,463
OH, COME ON, THAT WAS BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL.

173
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,465
HOW COULD THAT STILL BOTHER YOU?

174
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,469
OH, YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT, MONI COW.

175
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,473
OKAY, I HEAR YOU.

176
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,976
WHY, OF ALL PEOPLE, DO YOU HAVE TO GO OUT WITH CHIP?

177
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,978
YOU AND I WENT TO DIFFERENT HIGH SCHOOLS.

178
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,481
THAT DOESN'T HELP ME, BECAUSE WE WENT TO THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL.

179
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,983
YOU WENT TO ONE WHERE YOU WERE POPULAR

180
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,486
AND YOU GOT TO RIDE OFF ON CHIP'S MOTORCYCLE

181
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,488
AND WEAR HIS LETTERMAN JACKET.

182
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,990
I WENT TO ONE WHERE I WORE A BAND UNIFORM

183
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,992
THEY HAD TO HAVE SPECIALLY MADE.

184
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,996
THEY HAD TO HAVE THAT SPECIALLY MADE?

185
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,501
IT WAS A PROJECT FOR ONE OF THE HOME EC CLASSES.

186
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,504
OH, MY GOD.

187
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,506
THEY TOLD US THAT WAS FOR THE MASCOT.

188
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,008
BACK THEN, I THOUGHT

189
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,511
THAT I WOULD NEVER, EVER GET THE CHANCE

190
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,013
TO GO OUT WITH A CHIP MATTHEWS

191
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,016
AND NOW HE'S... HE'S CALLED ME UP AND ASKED ME OUT

192
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,019
AND THE FAT GIRL INSIDE ME REALLY WANTS TO GO.

193
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,521
I OWE HER THIS.

194
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,523
I NEVER LET HER EAT.

195
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,025
OH, YOU GO OUT WITH HIM.

196
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,026
OH, REALLY?

197
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,027
YEAH.

198
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,529
JUST, IF IT'S POSSIBLE

199
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,531
COULD YOU LEAVE HIM SOMEWHERE

200
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,033
AND GO HAVE SEX WITH ANOTHER GUY?

201
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,034
I'LL TRY.

202
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,039
YOU GUYS HAVING ANY LUCK GETTING RID

203
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,541
OF THE ENTERTAINMENT CENTER?

204
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,043
THERE WERE A COUPLE CALLS LAST NIGHT

205
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,545
BUT I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM

206
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,046
ARE GOING TO WORK OUT.

207
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,049
YES, JOEY HAS A VERY CAREFUL SCREENING PROCESS.

208
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,552
APPARENTLY, NOT EVERYONE IS QUALIFIED TO OWN

209
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,554
WOOD AND NAILS.

210
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,555
STOP IT. STOP IT.

211
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,558
SHE KEEPS SQUIRMING AND TRYING TO GET AWAY--

212
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,560
JUST LIKE WHEN SHE WAS ALIVE.

213
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,562
SO, PHEEBS, HOW LONG

214
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,064
IS YOUR MOM GOING TO BE WITH US?

215
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,566
WELL, I'M NOT SURE.

216
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,570
I MEAN, I GUESS UNTIL SHE, YOU KNOW, GETS USED TO THE FACT

217
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,572
THAT THERE'S, YOU KNOW, A NEW MOM.

218
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,574
YOU KNOW, I THINK SHE'S WORRIED

219
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,575
THAT SHE'S GOING TO...

220
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,577
SHE'S GOING TO BE REPLACED.

221
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,580
WELL, THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, IS IT? NO.

222
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,581
OKAY, I HAVE TO RETURN

223
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,583
A CALL IN THE OTHER ROOM.

224
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,585
WHY CAN'T YOU USE THE PHONE IN HERE?

225
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,087
WELL, I'M RETURNING A CALL FROM A CERTAIN MOM

226
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,589
AT THE B E A C H.

227
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,091
I JUST SPELLED THE WRONG WORD.

228
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,595
ANYWAY, I DON'T WANT TO DO IT

229
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,096
IN FRONT OF SOMEONE WITH A TAIL.

230
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,599
HEY, YOU SWORE YOU WOULD NEVER TELL.

231
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,104
SO, GUYS, AM I CRAZY, OR DOES PHOEBE'S MOM

232
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,607
REMIND ANYONE ELSE OF A CAT?

233
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,109
ROSS, DON'T START.

234
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,110
COME ON.

235
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,613
YOU CAN'T TELL ME YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE

236
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,615
THAT THERE'S A WOMAN INSIDE THAT CAT.

237
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,618
I BELIEVE IT.

238
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,620
NO, YOU DON'T.

239
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,621
YES, I DO.

240
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,122
NO, YOU D...

241
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,125
YOU KNOW WHAT?

242
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,128
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SUCK ME INTO THIS.

243
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,630
OH, SURE, I AM--

244
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,132
BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE RIGHT.

245
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,635
I DO NOT ALWAYS HAVE... OKAY, OKAY.

246
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,140
JURASSIC PARK  COULD HAPPEN.

247
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,146
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

248
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,150
ACTUALLY, I DO THINK KIRK WAS SMARTER THAN SPOCK.

249
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,659
YOU WERE KIDDING

250
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,662
ABOUT THE KIRK SPOCK THING, THOUGH, RIGHT?

251
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,169
WOW. THAT'S, UH... THAT'S PRETTY NICE.

252
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,170
PRETTY NICE?

253
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,673
YOU'LL HAVE TO PARDON MY ROOMMATE.

254
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,174
HE WANTED TO MARRY THIS.

255
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,176
WE DON'T HAVE 50 BUCKS.

256
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,679
BUT WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO TRADE FOR IT?

257
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,180
WE GOT A CANOE.

258
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,190
YOU KNOW, I... I REALLY DON'T THINK WE NEED A CANOE.

259
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,692
YOU GOT TO TAKE

260
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,193
THE CANOE.

261
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,194
ALL RIGHT, JUST...

262
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,697
JUST TAKE THE ENTERTAINMENT CENTER

263
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,699
AND THEN, WHEN YOU GET HOME

264
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,201
THROW THE CANOE AWAY.

265
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,202
WE'RE NOT THROWING IT AWAY.

266
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,204
I BUILT THAT CANOE.

267
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,206
GOOD FOR YOU!

268
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,714
GUYS, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BELIEVE

269
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,216
WHAT I JUST FOUND TACKED UP ON A TELEPHONE POLE.

270
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,718
LOOKS KIND OF FAMILIAR.

271
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:03,222
APPARENTLY, PHOEBE'S MOTHER ALSO GOES BY THE NAME JULIO.

272
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,724
WAIT A MINUTE.

273
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,225
THIS IS NOT THE SAME CAT.

274
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,227
THIS CAT'S ONLY THIS BIG.

275
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,229
YOU GUYS, THERE'S A LITTLE GIRL IN SOHO

276
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,731
LOOKING FOR THIS CAT.

277
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,233
I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

278
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,236
YEAH. A $200 REWARD SPLIT FIVE WAYS.

279
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,740
DO WE HAVE TO TELL HER?

280
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,741
YES, WE HAVE

281
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,242
TO TELL HER.

282
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,745
OH, BUT IT'S MADE HER SO HAPPY.

283
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,748
LITTLE GIRL MISSES HER CAT.

284
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,751
CRAZY LADY THINKS HER MOTHER IS IN A CAT.

285
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,253
OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT?

286
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,255
I HAVE TO GO HAVE DINNER WITH MY SON.

287
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,258
CAN I TRUST THAT, WHEN YOU SEE PHOEBE, YOU WILL TELL HER?

288
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,259
YES. YEAH.

289
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,261
THANK YOU.

290
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,765
I HATE WHEN ROSS IS RIGHT.

291
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,266
HE IS RIGHT, ISN'T HE?

292
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,267
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

293
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,270
THIS MIGHT BE ONE OF THE TIMES WHEN HE'S WRONG.

294
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,271
YOU THINK? YOU THINK?

295
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,773
OH, NO. HE'S RIGHT.

296
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,281
HI.

297
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,282
HI. HI.

298
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,784
HEY.

299
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,286
UH, PHEEBS

300
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,287
ABOUT YOUR MOM...

301
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,789
YEAH?

302
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,794
HOW'S THAT GOING?

303
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,795
SO GREAT.

304
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,297
OH, WE TOOK A NAP TOGETHER TODAY.

305
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,800
MY MOM FELL ASLEEP ON MY TUMMY AND PURRED.

306
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,303
THAT'S SO SWEET.

307
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,808
I'M GOING TO GET SOME COFFEE.

308
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,309
OKAY.

309
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,816
HUH? WHAT'D YOU SAY, JOE?

310
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,317
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

311
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,322
PHEEBS...

312
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,324
I JUST FEEL SO... OH...

313
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,827
I'M COMING ALREADY. GEEZ!

314
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,332

315
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,334
NOT YET, NOT YET, NOT YET, NOT YET

316
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,336
NOT YET, NOT YET, NOT YET!

317
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,342
HELLO, CHIP.

318
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,844
HEY, RACH, HOW YOU DOING?

319
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,845
I'M GREAT. I'M GREAT.

320
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,847
GOT A GREAT JOB AT BLOOMINGDALE'S

321
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,348
I HAVE WONDERFUL FRIENDS

322
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,351
AND EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT SEEING ANYONE RIGHT NOW

323
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,854
I'VE NEVER REALLY FELT BETTER ABOUT MYSELF.

324
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,357
SO, UH, MONICA READY YET?

325
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,863
SHE'LL BE OUT IN A SECOND.

326
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,366
SO, CHIP, HOW'S, UM, AMY WELSH?

327
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,367
AMY WELSH?

328
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,870
WOW. I HAVEN'T SEEN HER SINCE...

329
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,373
SO... MONICA ABOUT READY?

330
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,376
HI.

331
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,878
HEY. WOW. YOU LOOK GREAT.

332
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,879
THANKS.

333
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,380
WELL, YOU GUYS HAVE FUN.

334
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,882
CATCH YOU LATER.

335
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,383
GOOD BYE, CHIP.

336
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,385
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY ABOUT THIS?

337
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,887
ACTUALLY...

338
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,889
OKAY, GREAT!

339
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,394
THIS IS THE UNIT FOR YOU, MY FRIEND--

340
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,397
STURDY CONSTRUCTION, TONS OF STORAGE COMPARTMENTS

341
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,900
SOME BIG ENOUGH TO FIT A GROWN MAN.

342
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,902
WHAT?

343
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,903
OH, YEAH.

344
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,404
I GOT IN THERE MYSELF ONCE.

345
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,407
MY ROOMMATE BET ME FIVE BUCKS THAT I COULDN'T

346
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,910
AND THEN HE STUCK A BOARD THROUGH THE HANDLES

347
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,912
AND LOCKED ME IN-- YEAH.

348
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,915
IT WAS FUNNY TILL I STARTED FEELING LIKE I WAS IN A COFFIN.

349
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,416
NO, YOU...

350
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,418
YOU CAN'T FIT IN THAT THING.

351
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,920
THAT'S NOT DEEP ENOUGH.

352
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,421
OH, YEAH?

353
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,925
IF I CAN'T

354
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,428
I'LL KNOCK FIVE BUCKS OFF THE PRICE OF THE UNIT.

355
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,429
YOU HAVE YOURSELF A DEAL.

356
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,430
OKAY.

357
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,437
SEE? I TOLD YOU.

358
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,443
SOMETIMES I COME IN HERE JUST TO GET AWAY FROM IT.

359
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,447
HEY, A NICKEL!

360
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,452
HERE WE ARE.

361
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,455
OH, MY GOD, YOU STILL HAVE THE CHIPPER.

362
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,957
THE WHAT?

363
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,960
THAT'S WHAT WE USED TO CALL YOUR MOTORCYCLE

364
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,461
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

365
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,463
YOU KNOW, A MOTORCYCLE'S A CHOPPER

366
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,465
AND YOU'RE CHIP.

367
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,466
NEVER MIND.

368
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,469
NO. I THINK IT'S CUTE.

369
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,975
WOW.

370
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,477
A LIPPER FROM THE CHIPPER.

371
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,479
SO, YOU STILL IN TOUCH

372
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,481
WITH ANYONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL?

373
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,984
UM, THERE'S RACHEL, AND, UM...

374
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,485
I THINK THAT'S IT.

375
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:27,987
HOW ABOUT YOU?

376
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,489
OH, YEAH, I STILL HANG WITH SIMENS AND ZANA

377
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,992
AND I SEE SPINDLER A LOT, AND LEVINE, KELLY

378
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,494
AND I RUN INTO GOLDIE FROM TIME TO TIME.

379
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,997
STICK, BROWN, SULKOV, McGUIRE

380
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,499
J.T., BEARDSLEY...

381
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,001
IS THAT ALL?

382
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,503
YOU KNOW, AFTER HIGH SCHOOL

383
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,005
YOU JUST KIND OF LOSE TOUCH.

384
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,008
OH, YEAH, I RAN INTO RICHARD DORFMAN.

385
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:49,508
OH, HOW IS HE?

386
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,011
NOT SO GOOD. ME AND SIMENS

387
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,013
GAVE HIM A WEDGIE.

388
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,514
ISN'T HE AN ARCHITECT NOW?

389
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,018
YEAH. THEY STILL WEAR UNDERWEAR.

390
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,031
OH, MY GOD!

391
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,534
WHAT?!

392
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,039
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

393
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,040
YEAH.

394
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,543
WHAT HAPPENED?

395
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,547
OH, MAN! HE PROMISED HE WOULDN'T TAKE THE CHAIRS.

396
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,049
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

397
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,550
HOW WERE YOU LOCKED IN THERE?

398
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,552
WHERE THE HELL'S ALL OF OUR STUFF?

399
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,554
WELL, THIS GUY CAME BY TO LOOK AT THE UNIT

400
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,058
AND HE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS BIG ENOUGH TO FIT A GROWN MAN.

401
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,561
SO YOU GOT IN VOLUNTARILY?

402
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,064
I WAS TRYING TO MAKE A SALE.

403
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,566
IF I RUN INTO THAT GUY AGAIN, YOU KNOW

404
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,068
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO?

405
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,069
BEND OVER?!

406
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,574

407
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:59,078
AND THEN ZANA JUST LET ONE RIP!

408
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,584
NOT THAT I DON'T ENJOY TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE

409
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,087
WE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH, BECAUSE I DO

410
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,090
BUT MAYBE WE COULD TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

411
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,091
LIKE YOU.

412
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,593
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE YOU WORK.

413
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,095
YOU KNOW WHERE I WORK.

414
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,096
I DO?

415
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,097
THE MOVIE THEATER.

416
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,598
YOU USED TO COME IN

417
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,599
ALL THE TIME.

418
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,601
YOU STILL WORK AT THE MULTIPLEX?

419
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,104
LIKE I'D GIVE UP THAT JOB.

420
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,606
FREE POPCORN AND CANDY ANYTIME I WANT?

421
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,109
I CAN GET YOU FREE POSTERS FOR YOUR ROOM.

422
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,610
THANKS. I'M SET.

423
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,613
YOU KNOW WHO CAME IN THE OTHER NIGHT? PETERS.

424
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,616
HE JUST WENT OUT WITH LESLIE MASKIN.

425
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,118
GOT TO THIRD BASE!

426
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,125
DO YOU STILL LIVE WITH YOUR PARENTS?

427
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,626
YEAH, BUT I CAN STAY OUT

428
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,128
AS LATE AS I WANT.

429
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,634
YOU KNOW...

430
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,136
WITH ALL OUR STUFF GONE

431
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,139
THE UNIT DOESN'T SEEM THAT BIG.

432
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,641
WHY COULDN'T HE HAVE BEEN A KIDNAPPER?

433
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,645
WOW. THEY REALLY GOT YOU GUYS--

434
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,147
YOUR TV, THE CHAIRS.

435
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,650
YEAH, YOUR MICROWAVE, THE STEREO...

436
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,154
OH, MAN, HE TOOK THE FIVE OF SPADES!

437
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,156
OH, NO, NO. HERE IT IS.

438
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,161
OH, MY GOD. WHAT HAPPENED?

439
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,662
OH, UM, JOEY WAS BORN

440
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,665
AND THEN, 28 YEARS LATER, I WAS ROBBED.

441
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,170
SO HOW WAS YOUR DATE?

442
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,672
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW I ALWAYS WANTED TO GO OUT

443
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,674
WITH CHIP MATTHEWS IN HIGH SCHOOL?

444
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,178
WELL, TONIGHT, I ACTUALLY WENT OUT WITH CHIP MATTHEWS

445
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,679
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

446
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,681
OH, HONEY, I'M SORRY.

447
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,183
NO, IT'S OKAY.

448
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,185
NOT ONLY DID I GET TO GO OUT WITH CHIP MATTHEWS

449
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,686
I GOT TO DUMP CHIP MATTHEWS.

450
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,688
OH, THAT'S SO GREAT.

451
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,190
I KNOW.

452
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,691
HI.

453
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,694
SO, UH, WHAT DID THE INSURANCE COMPANY SAY?

454
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,697
OH, THEY SAID, "YOU DON'T HAVE INSURANCE HERE

455
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,199
SO STOP CALLING US."

456
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,204
YOU DIDN'T TELL HER?

457
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,709
OKAY, FINE.

458
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,711
PHEEBS.

459
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,213
YEAH, HI. HI.

460
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,715
LISTEN, UH...

461
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,219
THIS CAT BELONGS TO A LITTLE GIRL.

462
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,220
ALL RIGHT?

463
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,222
THERE ARE FLYERS ALL OVER THE PLACE.

464
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,723
I'M SORRY, SWEETIE.

465
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,726
HEY, WE CAN TAKE HER BACK

466
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,229
WITH YOU IF YOU WANT.

467
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,731
OH. HM MMM.

468
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,734
BUT YOU KNOW, SHE CHOSE TO FIND ME.

469
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,238
I MEAN, I HAVE TO RESPECT HER DECISION, RIGHT?

470
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:43,742
IT'S A GOOD CALL. RIGHT.

471
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,744
NO, NO! HEY! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!

472
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,746
LOOK, I AM SORRY THAT YOU FEEL GUILTY

473
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,749
OR WHATEVER ABOUT SPENDING TIME WITH YOUR NEW MOM

474
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,751
BUT THIS IS NOT YOUR OLD MOM.

475
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,253
THIS IS A CAT, OKAY?

476
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,255
JULIO THE CAT.

477
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,258
NOT MOM. CAT.

478
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,766
OKAY.

479
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,769
ROSS, HOW MANY PARENTS HAVE YOU LOST?

480
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,272
NONE.

481
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,274
THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

482
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,276
WHEN ONE OF THEM COMES BACK

483
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,278
DO YOU?

484
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,782
I BELIEVE THIS IS MY MOTHER.

485
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,285
EVEN IF I'M WRONG, WHO CARES?

486
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,287
JUST BE A FRIEND, OKAY?

487
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,788
BE SUPPORTIVE.

488
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,793
I'M SORRY.

489
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,296
OKAY.

490
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,799
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

491
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,805
YOU COULD SAY YOU'RE SORRY TO HER MOM.

492
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,315
I THINK SHE WOULD LIKE THAT.

493
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,828
COME HERE, HERE, COME HERE, COME HERE.

494
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,333
MRS. BUFFAY?

495
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,338
SORRY ABOUT WHAT I SAID.

496
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,341
UM, IT WAS-- IT WAS INSENSITIVE OF ME

497
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,844
TO SAY THAT YOU WERE JUST A CAT...

498
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:33,352
WHEN, CLEARLY, YOU ARE ALSO THE REINCARNATED SPIRIT...

499
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,853
OF MY FRIEND'S MOTHER.

500
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,857
THANK YOU.

501
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,361
WE BOTH FORGIVE YOU.

502
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,865
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THE LITTLE GIRL?

503
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,367
YEAH. OKAY, LISTEN...

504
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,869
UM, MOM, I HOPE YOU KNOW

505
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,871
THAT YOU STILL MEAN A LOT TO ME

506
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,874
AND YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME BACK ANYTIME.

507
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,378
PHEEBS, IF SHE COULD COME BACK AS A COUCH

508
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,880
WE'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

509
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,382
COME ON, MOM.

510
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,384
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU HOME.

511
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,885
I'LL GO WITH YOU. ME, TOO.

512
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,390
OH, YOU KNOW, I GOT AN EXTRA FUTON.

513
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,392
DUDE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRAG.

514
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,894
WE GOT NOTHING HERE.

515
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,430
YOU KNOW...

516
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,933
IT'S PEACEFUL OUT HERE.
