1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,504
HELLO.

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,006
Hey, it's me.

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,508
You can't stand to be in the same room as me

4
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,010
so I thought I'd apologize

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,511
over the phone. All...

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,016

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,018
HELLO.

8
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,020
Look, I just want to say

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,521
I'm really...

10
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,525

11
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,526
STOP CALLING!

12
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,029
Hey, hey, hey!

13
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,031
This is 92.3 WXRK, K Rock

14
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,533
calling with our $1,000 daily challenge.

15
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,035
ALL RIGHT.

16
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,037
What is the name of your roommate

17
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,540
who is very, very sorry and would do anything...?

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,546

19
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,048
DAMN IT, CHANDLER, STOP CALLING!

20
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,050
Joey Joey, it's Ross.

21
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,051
OH. SORRY, MAN.

22
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,052
That's all right.

23
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,053
WHAT'S UP?

24
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,554
Not much.

25
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:58,558
Uh, I got Chandler here and he's really, really sorry...

39
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,607
UGH... TURKEY.

40
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,110
UGH, GIVING THANKS.

41
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,111
UGH!

42
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,112
LOOK, EVERYONE.

43
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,614
IT'S THE SPIRIT OF THANKSGIVING.

44
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,117
SO, ARE THINGS WITH YOU AND JOEY ANY BETTER?

45
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,118
THEY COULDN'T BE WORSE.

46
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,620
I SPENT EIGHT HOURS CALLING HIM LAST NIGHT

47
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,122
TRYING TO GET HIM TO TALK TO ME.

48
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,623
OH, WOW.

49
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,126
EIGHT HOURS-- SO, YOU COULD PROBABLY REALLY USE

50
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,628
ONE OF THOSE PLUG IN TELEPHONE HEADSETS, HUH?

51
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,131
SHOULD WE ALL EXPECT CHRISTMAS GIFTS

52
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,633
THAT CAN BE STOLEN FROM YOUR OFFICE?

53
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,137
YOU SHOULDN'T.

54
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,140
SPEAKING OF CHRISTMAS

55
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,642
SINCE MONICA AND I ARE STARTING A NEW BUSINESS

56
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,144
AND HAVE, LIKE, NO MONEY

57
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,646
UM, THIS YEAR MAYBE WE COULD DO SECRET SANTA

58
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,648
AND THEN WE EACH ONLY BUY ONE GIFT

59
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,151
AND AND THERE'S THE ADDED MYSTERY

60
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,652
OF, YOU KNOW, WHO GETS WHO.

61
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,156
WHO GETS WHOM.

62
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,659
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DO THAT.

63
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,664
BUT IT IS CORRECT.

64
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,666
HEY, WHAT'S THIS?

65
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,168
IT'S ALL OF YOUR NAMES!

66
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,170
LET'S PICK.

67
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,173
HEY, WHAT'S GOING...

68
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,177
COME ON! NO, JOEY...!

69
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,679
JOEY, COME ON. WE'RE PICKING NAMES FOR SECRET SANTA.

70
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,182
OKAY.

71
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,685
I INVENTED SECRET SANTA, YOU KNOW.

72
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,187

73
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,188
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?

74
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,690
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID DIE HARDWAS YOUR IDEA.

75
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,691
IT WAS!

76
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,196
DON'T MAKE ME SHOW YOU THE NAPKIN.

77
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,704
OH, I'M GOING TO TAKE A NAP.

78
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,206
TURKEY MAKES ME SLEEPY.

79
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,208
WE HAVEN'T EATEN YET.

80
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,710
I KNOW, BUT ALL THAT WORK YOU'RE DOING

81
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,712
TO GET IT READY AND I JUST...

82
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,214
HEY, BY ANY CHANCE

83
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,715
DID EITHER OF YOU PICK RACHEL

84
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,217
FOR YOUR SECRET SANTA?

85
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,219
BECAUSE I WANT TO TRADE FOR HER.

86
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,220
I PICKED HER.

87
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,721
OOH, THANK GOD, YOU WANT HER.

88
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,722
OOH!

89
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,225
WOW. WHY DO YOU WANT TO GET RID OF HER SO BADLY?

90
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,727
BECAUSE SHE EXCHANGES EVERY GIFT SHE EVER GETS.

91
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,730
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HER SOMETHING SHE LIKES.

92
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,731
COME ON, LET'S TRADE!

93
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,233
OH, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

94
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,735
I GOT HER THAT BACKPACK, AND SHE LOVED IT.

95
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,737
I REMEMBER HOW MUCH SHE WAS CRYING THE DAY

96
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,739
THAT BIG DOG RAN OFF WITH...

97
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,242
WELL, THERE WAS NO BIG DOG.

98
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,245
ALL RIGHT, THIS SUCKS

99
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,248
BECAUSE I ALREADY GOT HER THIS BRIEFCASE, AND I HAD

100
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,249
"R.G." PUT ON IT.

101
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,750
HER INITIALS.

102
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,754
OH. OKAY. I'M REALLY BAD AT INITIALS.

103
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,759
WOW. YOU GOT YOUR SHOPPING DONE EARLY THIS YEAR.

104
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,262
YEAH, WELL, MY CAMEL CASH WAS ABOUT TO EXPIRE, SO...

105
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,264
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

106
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,266
OH, LIKE ROSS GELLER.

107
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,767
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH?

108
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,269
IT'S KIND OF A GIRLY BRIEFCASE.

109
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,771
WHO CARES? HE WORKS IN A MUSEUM.

110
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,274
HEY, WHAT TIME IS IT?

111
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,276
THE BIG GAME IS ABOUT TO START.

112
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,777
ROSS AND JOEY AREN'T HERE.

113
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,779
YOU CAN WATCH THE PARADE IF YOU WANT.

114
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,281
THANKS.

115
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,784
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS FREEZER?

116
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,286
OW! OW!

117
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,287
GOD, WHAT HAPPENED?

118
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,788
OH, MY GOD, ICE JUST GOT

119
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,290
IN MY EYE!

120
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,792
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SLEEP IN HERE.

121
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,794
MONICA GOT ICE IN HER EYE, AND IT HURTS.

122
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,296
OPEN IT UP. LET ME SEE.

123
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,797
OH, I CAN'T. IT REALLY KILLS.

124
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,299
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD

125
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,800
PUT SOME ICE ON IT.

126
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,302
OOH, IT LOOKS BAD.

127
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,305
HONEY, MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE YOU TO A DOCTOR.

128
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,806
NO. MY EYE DOCTOR IS RICHARD.

129
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,309
I CAN'T GO TO HIM WHEN I DON'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

130
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,312
HE'S REALLY PICKY ABOUT HIS PATIENTS.

131
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,314
OKAY, YOU'VE GOT TO GO.

132
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,316
WHAT'S HIS OFFICE NUMBER?

133
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,319
LIKE, I REMEMBER HIS OFFICE NUMBER.

134
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,321
SPEED DIAL SEVEN.

135
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,327
HI. YEAH, I'M CALLING ON BEHALF OF MONICA GELLER'S EYE, AND...

136
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,829
IS, UM... IS RICHARD BURKE IN TODAY?

137
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,833
HE'S OUT OF TOWN, BUT DOES SHE WANT TO SEE THE ON CALL DOCTOR?

138
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,834
YES!

139
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,337
YES! SHE'S VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT.

140
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,339
OKAY. WE'LL BE RIGHT IN.

141
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,841
OKAY, SO, UH, WHO'S GOING TO TAKE HER IN?

142
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,843
I'LL GO. YOU CAN WATCH YOUR PARADE.

143
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,350
THIS IS SO COOL.

144
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,851
TILL MONICA GETS BACK

145
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,353
IT'S, LIKE, I'M HEAD CHEF

146
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,356
AND I GET TO MAKE ALL THE DECISIONS.

147
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,358
HEY, HEY, I THOUGHT SHE TOLD YOU

148
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,360
TO FOLLOW THE RECIPE EXACTLY.

149
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,862
OKAY, GET OUT OF MY KITCHEN.

150
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,865
ALL RIGHT, I THINK I AM MAKING SOME PROGRESS WITH JOEY.

151
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,867
WHEN I WENT INTO THE APARTMENT

152
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,369
HE WENT STRAIGHT INTO HIS BEDROOM

153
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,371
BUT HE ONLY SLAMMED THE DOOR ONCE.

154
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,372
WOW.

155
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,873
I MEAN, YEAH, HE GAVE ME

156
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,375
THE FINGER WHILE DOING IT.

157
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,378
ALL RIGHT, I'VE... I GOT TO CALL MY MOM

158
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,381
AND ASK HER A LEFT HANDED COOKING QUESTION.

159
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,385
I'M GOING TO BE IN THERE.

160
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,888
WHILE I'M GONE...

161
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,392
CHANDLER, YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

162
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,397
SO, LISTEN, UH , I PICKED MONICA

163
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,898
FOR SECRET SANTA, BUT I'M ALREADY

164
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,400
GETTING HER SOMETHING FOR HANUKAH.

165
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,402
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WANT TO SWITCH.

166
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,403
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

167
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,406
I WAS TRYING TO TRADE FOR, UH... WELL, YOU.

168
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,407
REALLY?

169
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,409
WOW, THAT'S... THAT'S SO NICE.

170
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,411
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GET ME?

171
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,912
I DON'T KNOW, R.G.

172
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,914
I THOUGHT SOMETHING GIRLY FOR YOUR OFFICE.

173
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,416
YEAH.

174
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,419
WELL, MAYBE PHOEBE WILL SWITCH WITH ME.

175
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,420
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

176
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,422
YOU'LL GET STUCK WITH RACHEL.

177
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,923
SHE EXCHANGES EVERY GIFT SHE GETS.

178
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,425
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

179
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,427
I GOT HER LOTS OF STUFF SHE NEVER TOOK BACK.

180
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:08,428
LIKE?

181
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,929
LIKE THAT GOLD NECKLACE

182
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,431
I GOT HER LAST YEAR.

183
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,433
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME SHE WORE IT?

184
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:18,438
WELL, SHE WORE IT ALL CHRISTMAS DAY, AND THEN, UH...

185
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,440
BIG DOG?

186
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,445
HI.

187
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,946
HEY.

188
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,448
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

189
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,950
SENDING BACK THIS STUFF CHANDLER BOUGHT OUT OF GUILT.

190
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,952
EVERYTHING? EVEN THE TV?

191
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,455
NO. I'M GOING TO PUT THAT IN MY ROOM.

192
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,957
LISTEN, JOEY...

193
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,959
I KNOW WHAT HE DID WAS WRONG

194
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,461
BUT DON'T YOU THINK

195
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,463
YOU COULD AT LEAST HEAR THE GUY OUT?

196
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,965
BACK WHEN YOU AND RACHEL WERE TOGETHER

197
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,467
IF CHANDLER HAD KISSED HER

198
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,968
WOULD YOU HEAR HIM OUT?

199
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:49,969
GOOD POINT.

200
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,473
SO, UH, HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO PUNISH HIM?

201
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,974
FIVE YEARS.

202
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,477
YOU'VE SENTENCED HIM?

203
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,480
HEY, DON'T DO THE CRIME IF YOU CAN'T DO THE TIME.

204
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,982
JOEY, THE GUY IS YOUR BEST FRIEND.

205
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,983
WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

206
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,986
ANYWAY, I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE PUSHING FOR HIM SO HARD.

207
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,489
WITH HIM OUT OF THE WAY AS MY BEST FRIEND

208
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,990
THERE'S A SPOT OPEN.

209
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,993
WELL, WHO, ME?

210
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,995
YEAH.

211
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:16,996
WOW. I'M HONORED.

212
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,997
YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL DO

213
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,999
AS MY FIRST ACT AS YOUR BEST FRIEND?

214
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,000
WHAT?

215
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,502
I'M GOING TO GET YOU

216
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,504
TO TALK TO CHANDLER.

217
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,506
ALL RIGHT.

218
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,008
OH, BUT IF YOU WEREN'T MY BEST FRIEND...

219
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,510
YEAH...

220
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,013
OH, MY GOD. IS IT REALLY THAT BAD?

221
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,016
I WALK INTO THE ROOM, AND HE WON'T EVEN TALK TO ME.

222
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,520
HE'LL JUST MUMBLE SOMETHING IN ITALIAN...

223
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,023
AND I KNOW HE ONLY KNOWS THE BAD WORDS.

224
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,527
OH, I'M SO, SO SORRY.

225
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,528
I FEEL RESPONSIBLE.

226
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,030
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

227
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,535
HEY, GUNTHER, HAVE YOU, UH...

228
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,036
HAVE YOU SEEN CHANDLER?

229
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,038
I THOUGHT YOU WERE CHANDLER.

230
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,043
BUT, UM, ONE OF YOU IS OVER THERE.

231
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,551
OH.

232
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,553
HEY, JOE.

233
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,056
VA FA A NAPOLI, HUH?!

234
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,564
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU, OKAY?

235
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,065
THANKS FOR COMING IN.

236
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,066
SURE.

237
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,068
OH, MY GOD.

238
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,571
HOW CUTE IS THE ON CALL DOCTOR?

239
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,573
OH, SO CUTE THAT I'M THINKING

240
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,576
ABOUT JAMMING THIS PEN IN MY EYE.

241
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,086
YOU HAVE THE BEST LUCK WITH EYE DOCTORS.

242
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,088
I KNOW.

243
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,089

244
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,091
DR. BURKE WILL SEE YOU NOW.

245
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,593
OH, NO, NOT DR. BURKE.

246
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,094
DR. BURKE'S OUT OF TOWN.

247
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,596
THE ON CALL DOCTOR WILL SEE ME NOW.

248
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,098
DR. RICHARD BURKE IS OUT OF TOWN.

249
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,101
DR. TIMOTHY BURKE, HIS SON, WILL SEE YOU NOW.

250
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,104
READY?

251
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,612
HEY, I'M SORRY.

252
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,113
THAT...

253
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,115
WHERE YOU GOING?

254
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,617
MY FOLKS'.

255
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,120
OH. UH... WHEN YOU, WHEN YOU COMING BACK?

256
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,622
I DON'T KNOW.

257
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,124
I MIGHT STAY THERE FOR A FEW DAYS

258
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,126
WHILE I LOOK FOR AN APARTMENT.

259
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,628
WHAT?

260
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,630
AT FIRST I THOUGHT WE COULD TALK ABOUT THIS

261
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,131
YOU KNOW, WORK IT OUT

262
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,133
BUT SEEING YOU TWO TOGETHER AND ALL...

263
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,635
HEY, LOOK, WHAT DO YOU

264
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,636
WANT ME TO SAY?

265
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,137
DO YOU WANT ME

266
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,639
TO SAY I'LL STOP SEEING HER?

267
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,140
IT'S NOT ABOUT HER, OKAY?

268
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,644
BUT SEEING YOU TWO TOGETHER JUST REMINDS ME OF WHAT YOU DID

269
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,647
AND I DON'T WANT TO LIVE WITH SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW

270
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,149
WHAT IT IS TO BE A FRIEND, SO I'LL SEE YOU.

271
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,152
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE A FRIEND.

272
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,654
I JUST... I SCREWED UP.

273
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,155
YEAH, YOU DID...

274
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,658
AND THAT'S WHY I'M LEAVING.

275
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,159

276
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,160
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

277
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,663
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STAY FOR ME

278
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,665
THEN AT LEAST STAY FOR THEM.

279
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,167
OKAY, THEY HAVE HAD A VERY DIFFICULT YEAR

280
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,169
WHAT WITH THE ROBBERY AND ALL.

281
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,172
AND THAT CHICK USED TO BE VERY CUTE.

282
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,173
WHEN THAT GUY WAS ROBBING US

283
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,676
AND I WAS LOCKED IN THE ENTERTAINMENT UNIT

284
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,677
FOR SIX HOURS, DO YOU KNOW

285
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,679
WHAT I WAS DOING IN THERE ALL THAT TIME?

286
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,681
I WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW I LET YOU DOWN.

287
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,682
WOW.

288
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,183
YEAH, BUT IF I'D KNOWN

289
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,686
WHAT KIND OF FRIEND YOU WOULD TURN OUT TO BE

290
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,688
I WOULDN'T HAVE WORRIED ABOUT IT SO MUCH.

291
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:29,689
SEE YOU AROUND.

292
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,190
JUST WAIT ONE SECOND NOW.

293
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,193
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT I CAN DO, SOMETHING.

294
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,696
IF WE STILL HAD THAT ENTERTAINMENT UNIT

295
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,699
I WOULD GET IN THERE FOR SIX HOURS AND THINK

296
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,701
ABOUT HOW I LET YOU DOWN.

297
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,205
WHAT?

298
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,207
WE GOT A BOX.

299
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,714
I REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU.

300
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,216
IT WAS THE MORNING I LEFT FOR COLLEGE

301
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:01,220
AND YOU WERE JUST STANDING OUTSIDE THE DAIRY QUEEN.

302
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,224
I WAS JUST PROBABLY WAITING FOR IT TO OPEN.

303
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,226
GOT TO TELL YOU, YOU LOOK GREAT NOW.

304
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,728
YOU LOOK GREAT, TOO.

305
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,730
YOU'RE AN EXCELLENT PATIENT.

306
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,733
SO HOW DOES IT LOOK?

307
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,234
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE SCRATCH ON YOUR CORNEA.

308
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,737
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WEAR A PATCH FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

309
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,739
LIKE A PIRATE?

310
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,741
IF THAT HELPS YOU.

311
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,744
OOH.

312
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,245

313
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,248
SO HOW LONG YOU BEEN WORKING WITH YOUR DAD?

314
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,752
COME ON. ONE OF US HAD TO MENTION HIM.

315
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,756
I MOVED BACK HERE A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.

316
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,758
BIG FAMILY DINNER TONIGHT?

317
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,259
UH, HERE.

318
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,761
OH, NO WAY.

319
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,262
I WAS GOING TO HAVE THANKSGIVING

320
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,263
AT MY GIRLFRIEND'S...

321
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,264
OH.

322
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,266
BUT WE BROKE UP.

323
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,268
OH?

324
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,771
SHE SHE WASN'T READY FOR A SERIOUS COMMITMENT.

325
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,273
OH...

326
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,777
SO YOU MADE HER WALK THE PLANK, AYE, MATEY?

327
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,780
YOU'RE NOT WEARING THE PATCH YET.

328
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,784
I KNOW.

329
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,792
HE'S COMING HERE FOR THANKSGIVING?

330
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,293
I KNOW. IT'S SICK.

331
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,795
WHY IS IT SICK?

332
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,797
BECAUSE IT'S RICHARD'S SON.

333
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,299
IT'S LIKE INVITING A GREEK TRAGEDY OVER FOR DINNER.

334
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,803
OKAY, IF IT WERE GREEK, I'D BE BLIND IN BOTH EYES.

335
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,308
COME ON, I LIKE HIM BECAUSE HE'S HANDSOME AND HE'S NICE AND SMART

336
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,810
AND HANDSOME.

337
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,312
I MEAN, COME ON, PHOEBE.

338
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,314
YOU UNDERSTAND, DON'T YOU?

339
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,315
YEAH, I COULD SEE

340
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,317
WHERE I'D BE YOUR BEST SHOT, BUT NO.

341
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,819
NO, I'M SORRY, HONEY.

342
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,821
I THINK IT'S TWISTED.

343
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,822
WHAT'S TWISTED?

344
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,824
ME GOING OUT WITH RICHARD'S SON.

345
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,325
EWW!

346
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,328
EWW, EWW, EWW!

347
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,830
 SOUNDS LIKE

348
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,832
A REALLY BAD IDEA TO ME.

349
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,836
IS HE OKAY IN THERE?

350
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,338
HE'S FINE.

351
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,840
HEY, YOU KNOW, MON

352
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,342
IF THINGS WORK OUT BETWEEN YOU AND RICHARD'S SON

353
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,344
YOU'D BE ABLE TO TELL YOUR KIDS

354
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,346
THAT YOU SLEPT WITH THEIR GRANDFATHER.

355
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,849
FINE. JUDGE ALL YOU WANT TO

356
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,350
BUT MARRIED A LESBIAN

357
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,352
LEFT A MAN AT THE ALTAR

358
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,854
FELL IN LOVE WITH A GAY ICE DANCER

359
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,856
THREW A GIRL'S WOODEN LEG IN THE FIRE

360
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,357
LIVE IN A BOX!

361
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,367
SO, NOW, WHAT EXACTLY IS THE POINT OF THE BOX?

362
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,369
CHANDLER?

363
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,873
THE MEANING OF THE BOX IS THREEFOLD.

364
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,875
ONE:

365
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,377
IT GIVES ME THE TIME TO THINK ABOUT WHAT I DID.

366
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,379
TWO:

367
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,881
IT PROVES HOW MUCH I CARE

368
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,883
ABOUT MY FRIENDSHIP WITH JOEY.

369
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,885
AND THREE:

370
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,387
IT HURTS.

371
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,890
AND IF HE STAYS IN THE BOX

372
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,391
YOU GUYS WILL BE FRIENDS AGAIN?

373
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,894
LET'S JUST SAY IT'S A START.

374
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,395
OH, HEY.

375
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,898
HEY, UH, DO YOU REMEMBER THAT NECKLACE

376
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,399
THAT I GAVE YOU LAST YEAR?

377
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,901
CAN I SEE IT?

378
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,403
WHY?

379
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,905
I WANT TO CHECK SOMETHING.

380
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,406
OKAY.

381
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,913
NOW WE'LL SEE.

382
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,414
AIR HOLE! AIR HOLE!

383
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,415
SORRY.

384
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,418
HERE IT IS. I LOVE IT.

385
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,920
I WEAR IT ALL THE TIME.

386
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,925
THE NECKLACE I GOT YOU WAS GOLD.

387
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,927
THIS IS SILVER.

388
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,428
HUH.

389
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,932
WELL, MAYBE IT, UH...

390
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,934
IT CHANGED.

391
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,435
OH, MY GOD.

392
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,437
YOU ACTUALLY EXCHANGED IT.

393
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,439
ISN'T IT BETTER THAT I EXCHANGE IT

394
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,440
FOR SOMETHING THAT I ENJOY

395
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,442
AND CAN GET A LOT OF USE OUT OF?

396
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,946
WHAT DID YOU GET? CREDIT.

397
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,448

398
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,952
I'LL GET IT. I'LL GET IT. I'LL GET IT. I'LL GET IT.

399
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,456
HI, TIM.

400
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,457
HI.

401
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,458
HI. THANK YOU.

402
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,960
MEET MY FRIENDS.

403
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,962
THIS IS, UH, PHOEBE.

404
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,463
HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

405
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,464
AND JOEY.

406
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,966
HEY. MY BROTHER, ROSS.

407
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:07,967
HEY.

408
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,968
AND RACHEL.

409
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,471

410
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,473
THAT'S CHANDLER.

411
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,975
HOW DO YOU DO?

412
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,978
WHAT'S...?

413
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,479
WELL, HE'S, UM...

414
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,982
HE'S DOING SOME THINKING.

415
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,485
 McCallister tries...

416
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,987
YEAH! YES!

417
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,989
 WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT HAPPENED?

418
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,991
YOU KISSED MY GIRLFRIEND.

419
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:36,996
OOH, I LIKE THOSE SUNGLASSES.

420
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,497
"LIKE THEM" LIKE THEM

421
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,500
OR "I'D LIKE TO GET STORE CREDIT FOR THAT AMOUNT"

422
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,502
LIKE THEM?

423
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,005
VA FA A NAPOLI.

424
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,510
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY; THIS TURKEY IS READY.

425
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,512
WHERE CAN I WASH UP?

426
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,014
HERE. LET ME SHOW YOU.

427
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,017
OKAY, THE TOWELS ARE HANGING NEXT TO THE SINK

428
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,519
AND YOU CAN USE THE FANCY SOAP.

429
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,021
THANK YOU.

430
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,522
"FANCY SOAP"?

431
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,025
I THOUGHT WE WERE SAVING THAT FOR THE POPE.

432
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,526
SEE? HE'S NICE, RIGHT?

433
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,528
BUT DO YOU REALLY WANT

434
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,031
TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP WHERE YOU CAN USE THE PHRASE

435
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,533
"THAT'S NOT HOW YOUR DAD USED TO DO IT"?

436
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,540
WOW. EVERYTHING LOOKS GREAT.

437
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,541
WHERE SHOULD I SIT?

438
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,043
SAVED YOU A SEAT.

439
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,546
SICK, SICK, SICK, SICK, SICK.

440
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,548

441
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,050
OH, I'LL GET IT.

442
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,051
 GOTCHA!

443
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,054

444
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,557
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THINKING TO ME.

445
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,558
SORRY.

446
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,560
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE TALKING AT ALL.

447
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,063
I THINK YOU GOT TOO MUCH THINKING TO DO

448
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,564
TO BE TALKING AND MAKING JOKES.

449
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,066
OKAY, OKAY. YOU GOT IT.

450
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,068
ROSS, COULD YOU PASS ME THE YAMS?

451
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,070
OH, AND JOEY'S GOT THE MASHED POTATOES

452
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,072
IF YOU WANT TO EXCHANGE THEM.

453
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,079
WILL YOU STOP? WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

454
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,081
OH, WE'VE GOT COMPANY.

455
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,085
THERE'S NOTHING THE MATTER WITH ME.

456
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,587
SEE, I'M NOT COMPLETELY DEVOID OF SENTIMENT.

457
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,089
SEE, I HAVE FEELINGS.

458
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,592
OKAY, FINE.

459
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:22,101
YOU CAN'T TELL, BUT I'M TRYING TO BREAK THE TENSION

460
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,603
BY MOONING YOU GUYS.

461
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,108
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

462
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,611
IF THIS IS JUST A BIG JOKE TO YOU, THEN FORGET ABOUT IT.

463
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,113
ALL RIGHT, THIS MEANS SOMETHING TO ME.

464
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,115
IF IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU

465
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,617
THEN YOU SHOULD GET OUT OF THERE.

466
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,120
OTHERWISE, YOU'RE JUST AN IDIOT IN A BOX.

467
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,122
YOU'RE RIGHT, AND I'M SORRY.

468
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,124
THIS MEANS A LOT TO ME.

469
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,126
I WANT YOU TO BE MY FRIEND AGAIN.

470
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,628
I SWEAR I WON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD TONIGHT.

471
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,131
SO YOU'RE GOING TO START TAKING THIS THING SERIOUSLY?

472
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,632
ABSOLUTELY.

473
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,134
THAT SOUNDS LIKE ANOTHER WORD TO ME.

474
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,138
ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY?

475
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,143
OKAY.

476
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,648
DON'T SAY THAT I HAVE NO SENTIMENT.

477
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,652
THIS IS A MOVIE STUB FROM OUR FIRST DATE.

478
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,154
THIS IS AN EGGSHELL

479
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,656
FROM THE FIRST TIME YOU MADE ME BREAKFAST IN BED.

480
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,658
THIS IS FROM THE MUSEUM

481
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,660
THE FIRST TIME...

482
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,163
WE WERE TOGETHER.

483
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,165
OKAY, MAYBE

484
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,666
I EXCHANGE GIFTS SOMETIMES

485
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,669
BUT I KEEP THE THINGS THAT MATTER.

486
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,171
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

487
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,173
I'M SORRY.

488
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,175
THOUGH...

489
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,677
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TAKE THESE.

490
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,183
IT'S, LIKE, A MILLION YEARS OLD.

491
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,185
WE... WE ACTUALLY...

492
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,687
WE HAVE PEOPLE LOOKING FOR THAT.

493
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,693
HEY...

494
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,695
MIND IF I SMOKE?

495
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,197
CARE IF I DIE?

496
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,699
NO. I'M JUST KIDDING, I'M JUST KIDDING.

497
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,701
GO AHEAD, SMOKE.

498
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,203
OH, THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS.

499
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,205
HERE. LET ME, UM...

500
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,207
THANK YOU.

501
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,213
YOU HAVE VERY BEAUTIFUL...

502
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,714
EYE.

503
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,219
YOU KNOW, MY FRIENDS ALL THINK THIS IS WEIRD.

504
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,221
EVEN THE ONE IN THE BOX?

505
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,224
IT'S NOT WEIRD, IS IT?

506
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,226
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE WEIRD.

507
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,728
I ALMOST CALLED TO CANCEL, BUT IT REALLY ISN'T.

508
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,231
I KNOW. IT'S LIKE YOU AND YOUR DAD--

509
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,732
THAT'S A TOTALLY SEPARATE THING.

510
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,735
OH, I TOTALLY AGREE.

511
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,737
WE'RE JUST TWO PEOPLE WHO FIND EACH OTHER...

512
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,240
VERY ATTRACTIVE.

513
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,242
RIGHT?

514
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,753
WHAT?

515
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,256
NOTHING. NOTHING.

516
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,259
NO. NO, REALLY-- WAS THAT NOT OKAY?

517
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,760
NO, NO, NO, NO. THAT WAS GOOD.

518
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,761
THAT WAS, UH...

519
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,264
THAT WAS A GOOD KISS.

520
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,266
OH, MY GOD, IT DIDN'T REMIND YOU OF MY...?

521
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,767
OH, DON'T SAY IT!

522
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,769
NO, BUT IT DID, DIDN'T IT?

523
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,271
YES! OH, MAN!

524
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,272

525
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,773
I KNOW!

526
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,775

527
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,277
MY GOD, I AM SORRY.

528
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,778
I AM... I AM SO SORRY.

529
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:20,779
IT'S OKAY.

530
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,781
I MEAN, WOULDN'T BE THANKSGIVING

531
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,284
WITHOUT A LITTLE EMOTIONAL SCARRING.

532
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,285
OH...

533
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,287
YOU KNOW WHAT'S EVEN WORSE?

534
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,289
MY FRIENDS WERE RIGHT.

535
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,291
YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORST THING IS FOR ME

536
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,294
IS THAT YOU ACTUALLY REMIND ME OF A YOUNGER VERSION OF...

537
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,795
MY MOM.

538
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,802
 ...that's 18 yards.

539
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,304
Is he having quite a day.

540
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,805

541
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,307

542
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,808
I GOT IT.

543
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,314
OH.

544
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,815
HEY.

545
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,317
HEY.

546
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,319
LISTEN. I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW SORRY I AM...

547
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,321
THAT'S OKAY.

548
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,823
CHANDLER'S THE ONE I'M MAD AT, SO...

549
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,826
WELL, I'M STILL SORRY.

550
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,828
IS HE HERE?

551
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,330
IN THE BOX.

552
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,834
HI.

553
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,339
CHANDLER?

554
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,841
OH, HE CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.

555
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,343
WHY NOT?

556
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,344
WHAT'S GOING ON?

557
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,845
HE'S TRYING TO SHOW JOEY

558
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,347
HOW MUCH HE MEANS TO HIM.

559
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,849
BY BEING IN A BOX.

560
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,851
JOEY HAD REASONS.

561
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,854
THEY WERE THREE FOLD.

562
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,359
OH. WELL, UH...

563
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,361
YOU NOT BEING ABLE TO TALK

564
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,363
MIGHT ACTUALLY MAKE THIS EASIER.

565
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,865
LISTEN, UM...

566
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,376
LISTEN.

567
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,378
I DON'T WANT TO BE SOMEONE

568
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:03,882
WHO COMES BETWEEN TWO BEST FRIENDS.

569
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:07,886
I JUST... I CAN'T STAND SEEING WHAT THIS IS DOING TO YOU GUYS

570
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,888
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE THE CAUSE OF THAT.

571
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,393
SO... I DON'T THINK WE CAN SEE EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

572
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,894
I'M GOING TO GO

573
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,896
TO MY MOM'S IN CHICAGO.

574
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,399
I'M GOING TO STAY THERE FOR A WHILE.

575
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,408
I THINK THIS COULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING REALLY AMAZING.

576
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,409

577
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,912
BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS PROBABLY FOR THE BEST.

578
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,415
YOU KNOW?

579
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,921
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU.

580
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,926
GOOD BYE, CHANDLER.

581
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,436

582
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,937
OPEN THE BOX!

583
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,440
 WHAT?

584
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,941
HE CAN STILL CATCH HER!

585
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,943
HEY, COME ON. GET OUT OF THERE!

586
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,945
GET OUT OF THERE!

587
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,447
SO...?

588
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,449
YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO BE FINE. GET OUT.

589
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,452
YEAH?

590
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,455
YEAH. YOU DID SOME REAL GOOD THINKING IN THERE.

591
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,457
I MEAN, THIS IS...

592
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,459

593
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,464
NOW, GO BECAUSE YOU CAN STILL CATCH HER

594
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,467
AND MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM YOUR SECRET SANTA!

595
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,473
ALL RIGHT, WHO GOT CHANDLER? BECAUSE I NEED TO TRADE.

596
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,981
OH, HE SEES HER.

597
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,984
OH, HE'S CATCHING UP TO HER.

598
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,487
OH, SHE SEES HIM.

599
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,988
OH, THEY'RE HUGGING.

600
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,990
OHH.

601
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,492
HE'S TAKING HER PURSE.

602
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,995
UH, THAT'S NOT THEM.

603
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,498
I'M GOING TO GO CALL THE POLICE.

604
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,002
OH, THERE THEY ARE!

605
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,505
WHERE? OH...

606
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,006

607
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,008
ALL RIGHT, GET A ROOM.
