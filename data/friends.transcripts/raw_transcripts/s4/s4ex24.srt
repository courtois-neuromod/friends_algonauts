639
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,518
THE WALTHAM RESIDENCE.

640
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,519
OH, YES. IS THIS EMILY'S PARENTS' HOUSE?

641
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,521
This is the housekeeper speaking.

642
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,022
AND BY THE WAY, YOUNG LADY

643
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,526
THAT IS NOT HOW ONE ADDRESSES A PERSON ON THE TELEPHONE.

644
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,529
First, one identifies oneself

645
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:35,033
AND THEN ASKS FOR THE PERSON WITH WHOM ONE WISHES TO SPEAK.

646
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:39,037
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

647
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:42,541
NOW, LET US TRY THAT AGAIN, SHALL WE?

648
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,543
NO! OH!

649
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,546
OH, MY... GOD!

650
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,549

651
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,551
THE WALTHAM RESIDENCE.

652
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,052
Hello.

653
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,054
THIS IS PHOEBE BUFFAY.

654
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,556
I WAS WONDERING, PLEASE

655
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,058
IF IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE, PLEASE

656
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,062
UM, IF, MIGHT I SPEAK WITH MISS EMILY WALTHAM, PLEASE?

657
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,566
MISS WALTHAM IS AT THE REHEARSAL DINNER

658
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:11,570
AND IT IS NOT POLITE TO MAKE FUN OF PEOPLE. GOOD BYE.

659
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,572
NO, NO! I'LL BE NICE, I SWEAR.

660
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,574
COULD YOU GIVE ME THE NUMBER WHERE THEY ARE?

661
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:20,078
I'M AFRAID I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO DIVULGE THAT INFORMATION.

662
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,582
LOOK, SOMEBODY IS ON THEIR WAY TO RUIN THE WEDDING, OKAY?

663
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,083
AND I HAVE TO WARN SOMEBODY.

664
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,586
ALL RIGHT, SO IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME THAT NUMBER

665
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,588
THEN I'M GOING TO COME OVER THERE

666
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,590
AND I'M GOING TO KICK YOUR SNOOTY ASS

667
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,592
ALL THE WAY TO NEW... GLOUCKENSHIRE.

668
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,094
HELLO? HELLO? OH.

669
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,096
OOH, SHE KNEW I COULD KICK HER ASS.

670
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,602
HEY. HI...

671
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,103
SWEETHEART.

672
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,606
MOM... DAD...

673
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:48,607
OH, SORRY WE'RE LATE.

674
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,109
MY FAULT. I INSISTED ON RIDING THE TUBE.

675
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,111
JUDY, THE KIDS.

676
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,615
JACK, THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL THE SUBWAY.

677
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,117
OH. I THOUGHT...

678
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,120
DAD, DAD, WE GOT IT, WE GOT IT.

679
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,122
OH, HERE COMES  MY DAD AND STEPMOM.

680
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,624
MR. AND MRS. GELLER...

681
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,125
HI, HOW ARE YOU?

682
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,127
THIS IS STEVEN... AND ANDREA WALTHAM.

683
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,630
HOW DO YOU DO? VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

684
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,631
DARLING, THE GELLERS.

685
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,633
DARLING, IT'S THE GELLERS.

686
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,135
SHE'S VERY SELF- INVOLVED, YOU KNOW.

687
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,137
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE MARRIED HER.

688
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,140
SORRY, WHAT?

689
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,141
IT'S THE GELLERS, DARLING.

690
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,142
WHERE?

691
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,143
WELL, THAT'S ONE

692
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,145
AND THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

693
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,146
LOVELY TO MEET YOU.

694
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,147
TERRIBLY NICE OF YOU

695
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,649
TO OFFER TO PAY FOR HALF THE WEDDING.

696
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,650
OH, FORGET IT. THE HELL WITH TRADITION.

697
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,151
WE'RE HAPPY TO DO IT.

698
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,654
OH, YEAH, WE KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE WEDDINGS CAN BE.

699
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,156
BESIDES, THIS MAY BE THE ONLY WEDDING

700
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,157
WE GET TO THROW.

701
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,161
A JOKE THAT'S FUNNY IN ALL COUNTRIES.

702
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,667
SIR?

703
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,669
WHAT'S IN IT?

704
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,671
GOAT CHEESE, WATERCRESS AND PANCETTA.

705
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,676
THAT'S NOT FOOD.

706
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,177
NO, I DON'T, NO...

707
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,181
EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT HERE.

708
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,683
I WANT TO GO HOME.

709
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,184
I I... MISS MY FAMILY.

710
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,686
I MISS THE COFFEE HOUSE.

711
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,689
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT PHOEBE LOOKS LIKE.

712
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,692
JOEY, IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS.

713
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,193
OKAY, YOU'RE JUST...

714
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,695
JUST A LITTLE HOMESICK.

715
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,698
OKAY, WOULD YOU JUST TRY TO RELAX AND JUST...

716
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,699
JUST ENJOY YOURSELF.

717
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,701
YOU'RE DIFFERENT HERE, TOO.

718
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,204
YOU'RE MEAN IN ENGLAND.

719
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,207
WHAT THE HELL!

720
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,709
WHAT'S UP, DAD?

721
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,711
THIS BILL FOR MY HALF OF THE WEDDING.

722
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,712
IT'S INSANE.

723
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,213
HOW CAN IT  BE SO MUCH?

724
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,715
THE RECEPTION'S AT THEIR HOUSE.

725
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,718
FLOWERS, LIQUOR, RECARPET FIRST FLOOR.

726
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,219
NEW GUEST BATH.

727
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,721
LANDSCAPING.

728
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,723
I'M PAYING TO REMODEL THIS GUY'S HOUSE.

729
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,725
I'M GOING TO GIVE THAT SON OF A BITCH

730
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,726
A PIECE OF MY MIND.

731
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,227
DAD.

732
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,228
COME ON. PLEASE

733
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,231
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO UPSET EMILY TONIGHT.

734
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,735
SHE'S HAD A HARD ENOUGH COUPLE OF DAYS AS IT IS.

735
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,237
HERE. HERE. LET ME GO TALK TO HIM, OKAY?

736
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,238
WELL, YOU TELL THEM

737
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,741
NO ONE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE GELLERS.

738
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,742
OOH, JACK.

739
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:08,747
SOMETIMES I FORGET HOW POWERFUL YOU CAN BE.

740
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,753
AND I'M GOING TO GO GET DRUNK.

741
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,258
OOH, OOH, OOH!

742
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,259
HI.

743
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,761
HELLO.

744
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,762
HELLO.

745
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,264
UM, WHEN IS YOUR NEXT FLIGHT TO LONDON?

746
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,767
THERE'S ONE LEAVING IN 30 MINUTES

747
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,269
AND I DO HAVE ONE SEAT LEFT.

748
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,271
OH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

749
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:37,275
THE LAST MINUTE FARE ON THIS TICKET IS $2,700 DOLLAR.

750
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,779
HUH. HOW ABOUT $600.00 DOLLAR?

751
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,781
SORRY.

752
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,283
HOW ABOUT $600.00 DOLLAR AND THESE EARRINGS?

753
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,287
THEY PREFER IT IF I DON'T BARTER.

754
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,789
OH. I JUST DON'T THINK.

755
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,291
I HAVE ENOUGH LEFT ON MY CREDIT CARD.

756
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,794
WELL, YOU CAN SPLIT IT WITH ANOTHER CREDIT CARD.

757
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,796
WELL, OKAY, HOW ABOUT FIVE?

758
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:00,799
OH, THANK YOU.

759
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,802
I'M JUST GOING TO NEED TO SEE YOUR PASSPORT.

760
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,305
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

761
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,807
I DON'T HAVE IT, BUT I CAN TELL YOU

762
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,809
EXACTLY WHERE IT IS ON MY NIGHTSTAND

763
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,811
AND... OKAY.

764
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,312
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

765
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,815
OKAY, I HAVE MY... I HAVE MY DRIVER'S LICENSE

766
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,819
AND I HAVE A 20.

767
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,324
LOOK, FACE IT: MY FATHER IS NOT GOING TO PAY

768
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,826
FOR THE BUILT IN BARBECUE

769
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:31,329
AND BELIEVE ME, YOU CAN KISS YOUR GAZEBO GOOD BYE.

770
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,834
NOW, I MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET YOU THE NEW LAWN.

771
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,837
AH, THEN YOU HAVE TO GIVE US THE LAWN ORNAMENTS.

772
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,339
I GO BACK THERE WITH LAWN ORNAMENTS

773
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,842
HE'S GOING TO LAUGH IN MY FACE.

774
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:44,843
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

775
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,845
I MEAN, WE HAD AN AGREEMENT.

776
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,849
WILL YOU SAY SOMETHING, STEVEN?!

777
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,850
PLEASE.

778
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,854
DON'T TAKE THAT TONE WITH ME.

779
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,857
ALL ALL RIGHT, YOU CAN.

780
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,862
HI, PHEEBS.

781
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,863
OH, THANK GOD.

782
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,364
OH, YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND.

783
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,867
LOOK, I KNOW YOU PROBABLY WANT TO BE ALONE AND YOU DON'T WANT

784
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,869
TO TALK ABOUT IT. THAT'S FINE.

785
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,872
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW I THINK YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING.

786
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:14,873
BYE, PHEEBS!

787
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,374
WAIT, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

788
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,876
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? NO! WAIT!

789
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:22,881
GOD! WHY AM I ALWAYS PREGNANT WHEN SHE DOES THAT?!

790
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,391
I'D LIKE TO MAKE A TOAST TO ROSS AND EMILY.

791
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:34,893
OF COURSE, MY BIG TOAST

792
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,394
WILL BE TOMORROW AT THE WEDDING

793
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,396
SO THIS IS KIND OF MY LITTLE TOAST

794
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,898
OR MELBA TOAST, IF YOU WILL.

795
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,902
OKAY.

796
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,904
I'VE KNOWN ROSS FOR A LONG TIME.

797
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,906
IN FACT, I KNEW HIM WHEN HE WAS GOING OUT

798
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,407
WITH HIS FIRST GIRLFRIEND

799
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,909
AND I THOUGHT THINGS

800
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,410
WERE REALLY GOING TO WORK OUT FOR THEM

801
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,412
UNTIL THE DAY HE OVERINFLATED HER.

802
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,918
OH, DEAR GOD.

803
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:00,919
WHAT?

804
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,921

805
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,423
HELLO, WALTHAM INTERIORS.

806
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:06,925
OH, HI. MRS. WALTHAM?

807
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,928
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH EITHER ONE OF THE BEST MEN

808
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,429
OR ROSS'S SISTER, MONICA.

809
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,931
WHO IS THIS?

810
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:13,932
OH, I'M PHOEBE BUFFAY.

811
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,934
I'M ONE OF ROSS'S BEST FRIENDS.

812
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,436
HOW DID YOU GET THIS NUMBER?

813
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,438
I GOT IT FROM YOUR MAID.

814
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,441
SHE'S A BITCH, BUT I WORE HER DOWN.

815
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,943
WELL, IF YOU'RE ONE OF ROSS'S BEST FRIENDS

816
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,444
WHY AREN'T YOU HERE?

817
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,948

00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,958
COULD I TALK TO ONE OF THEM?

822
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,960

00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,038

853
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:04,542
I WAS HOPING TO GET TO KNOW YOU BETTER.

854
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,045
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE, SWEETHEART.

855
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,553
I WAS LAUGHING.

856
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:19,557
OUT LOUD?

857
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,560
WELL, I DIDN'T WANT EVERYONE TO THINK I WAS STUPID.

858
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,062
SO HOW YOU DOING?

859
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,563

I'M NOT GOING TO LET ANYTHING SPOIL THAT.

862
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:35,573
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT ROSS IS A WONDERFUL YOUNG MAN.

MY GOD.

865
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,081
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN A TEENAGER WHEN YOU HAD HIM.

866
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,090
THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL I'M PAYING FOR IT.

867
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,592
LOOK, WE'RE DOWN TO JUST ONE POINT.

868
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,096

869
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,098

870
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,100

THE GUY WAS HAMMERED, OKAY?

874
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,113
THERE'S NO WAY YOU LOOK LIKE ROSS'S MOTHER.

875
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,615
THEN WHY WOULD HE SAY IT?

876
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,117
BECAUSE HE'S CRAZY, OKAY?

877
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,619
HE CAME UP TO ME EARLIER AND THANKED ME

878
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,122
FOR MY VERY MOVING PERFORMANCE IN TITANIC.

879
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,625
OH, MY MOTHER'S RIGHT.

880
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,627
I'M NEVER GOING TO GET MARRIED.

881
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,130
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT IS...

882
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,632

883
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,134

894
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,155

968
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,350

976
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,367
ALL THIS STUFF THAT I HAD BEEN DOING:

977
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,868
PROPOSING TO JOSHUA

978
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,871
LYING TO ROSS ABOUT WHY I COULDN'T COME TO THE WEDDING

979
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,373
WAS ALL JUST A WAY OF...

980
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:36,374
OH! OH! OH!

YET YOU'RE ABOUT TO RUIN THE HAPPIEST DAY OF HIS LIFE.

988
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,391
I'M AFRAID I HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOUR FRIEND PHEEBS.

989
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,894
THIS IS A... THIS IS A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE PLAN.

00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,397
BUT HE HAS TO KNOW HOW I FEEL!

991
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,898
BUT WHY?

992
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,400
HE LOVES THIS... THIS EMILY PERSON.

993
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,901
NO GOOD CAN COME OF THIS.

994
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,403

995
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,904
WELL, I I THINK YOU'RE WRONG.

996
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,406
OH, NO!

997
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,913
WELL, HE DOESN'T REALLY LOVE HER.

998
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,416
I MEAN, IT'S JUST A REBOUND THING FROM ME.

999
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,917
YOU... YOU...

1000
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:20,918
YOU'LL SEE.

1001
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,420
FORTUNATELY, I WON'T.

1002
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,423
AND, BY THE WAY, IT SEEMS TO BE PERFECTLY CLEAR

1003
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,924
THAT YOU WERE ON A BREAK.

1004
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,427

1005
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,935

1007
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,943
HEY. HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN MONICA?

1008
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,445
I'M NOT SEEING MONICA.

1009
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:51,949

1010
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,451

00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,952
WE GOT TO FIND HER. PHOEBE JUST CALLED.

1012
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,455
RACHEL'S COMING TO TELL ROSS SHE LOVES HIM!

1013
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,956

00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,458

00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,477
OH, MY GOD!

1018
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,978
IT'S LIKE A FAIRYLAND.

1020
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,482

00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:25,983
WELL, I LOVE IT.

1022
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,486

1024
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,988

00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,491
PSST! MONICA!

1027
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,993
WE REALLY NEED TO START LOOKING OUT FOR RACHEL.

1028
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,995
I'LL COVER THE FRONT DOOR.

1029
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,499
YOU WATCH THAT BIG HOLE AT THE BACK OF THE BUILDING

1030
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,001
AND I GOT CHANDLER COVERING ROSS.

1031
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,504
WHY WOULD I CARE WHERE CHANDLER IS?

1032
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,005
YOU KNOW, UH...

1033
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,008
SOMETIMES I DON'T EVEN LIKE CHANDLER.

1034
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,511
OKAY.

1035
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,014

00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,048
WE'RE NOT PAYING FOR YOUR WINE CELLAR.

1052
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,050

1057
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,058
EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL.

YOU WANT A PIECE OF ME?

1061
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,064

00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,066
