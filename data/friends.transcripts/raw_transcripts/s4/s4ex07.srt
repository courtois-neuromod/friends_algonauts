1
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:04,504
I JUST WALKED IN THE BATHROOM

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,006
AND SAW KATHY NAKED.

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,008
IT WAS LIKE TORTURE.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,510
YOU KNOW, IF WE EVER GO TO WAR AND YOU'RE CAPTURED

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,512
YOU'RE IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE.

6
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,514
IT JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE.

7
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,517
IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT I'M IN LOVE WITH MY ROOMMATE'S GIRLFRIEND

8
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,518
WHICH I THINK

9
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,519
SHE KNOWS.

10
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,022
EVERY TIME WE'RE IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER

11
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,523
THERE'S THIS WEIRD ENERGY BETWEEN US.

12
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,025
AND CALL ME CRAZY

13
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,027
BUT I THINK SHE LIKES ME, TOO.

14
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,030
AND NOW... I HAVE SEEN HER NAKED.

15
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,532
AT LEAST, WHEN I'D SEEN HER WITH CLOTHES ON

16
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,534
I COULD IMAGINE THAT HER BODY

17
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,535
WAS COVERED IN BOILS

18
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,037
OR SOMETHING.

19
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,539
BUT THERE ARE NO BOILS.

20
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,540
SHE'S SMOOTH.

21
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,044
SMOOTH!

22
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,048
WOW.

23
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,050
COULD EVERYONE TOTALLY SEE UP HIS ROBE?

24
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,552
YEAH, RIGHT UP IT. OH, MY GOD!

37
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,501
GREAT. ALL RIGHT.

38
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,002
SO I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

39
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:44,003
GREAT.

40
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,106
HEY, HEY, HEY.

41
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,607
WHO WAS THAT?

42
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,608
THAT WOULD BE CACEY.

43
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,110
WE'RE GOING OUT TONIGHT.

44
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,111
GOING OUT, HUH?

45
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,113
WOW! WOW!

46
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,117
SO, THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT WITH KATHY, HUH?

47
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,118
BUMMER.

48
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,120
NO, THINGS ARE FINE WITH KATHY.

49
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,122
I'M HAVING A LATE DINNER WITH HER TONIGHT

50
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,623
RIGHT AFTER MY EARLY DINNER

51
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,624
WITH CACEY.

52
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,126
WHAT?

53
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,129
AND THE CRAZIEST THING IS I JUST ATE A WHOLE PIZZA

54
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,630
MYSELF.

55
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,132
BUT...

56
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,633
YOU'RE GOING OUT WITH KATHY.

57
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,634
YEAH.

58
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,136
WHY ARE YOU GETTING SO UPSET?

59
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,637
WELL, I'M UPSET...

60
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,139
FOR YOU.

61
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,140
YOU KNOW, I MEAN

62
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,143
HAVING SEX WITH AN ENDLESS LINE OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN

63
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,644
MUST BE VERY UNFULFILLING

64
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,146
FOR YOU.

65
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,647
WH WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?

66
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,150
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE EXCLUSIVE.

67
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,152
LOOK, JOEY.

68
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,655
KATHY IS CLEARLY NOT FULFILLING YOUR EMOTIONAL NEEDS

69
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,656
BUT CACEY...

70
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,659
I MEAN, GRANTED, I JUST SAW THE BACK OF HER HEAD

71
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,663
BUT I GOT THIS SENSE THAT SHE'S SMART

72
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,666
AND FUNNY AND GETS YOU.

73
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,170
YOU GOT ALL THAT FROM THE BACK OF HER HEAD?

74
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,672
I JUST THINK IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO SETTLE DOWN--

75
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,674
YOU KNOW, MAKE A CHOICE, PICK A LANE.

76
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,176
WHO'S ELAINE?

77
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,682
?? LITTLE TINY TARZAN ??

78
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,184
?
?? SWINGING ON A NOSE HAIR ?

79
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,686
?? SWINGING WITH THE GREATEST OF EASE... ??

80
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,189

81
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,192
DARN IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET TO THE NEXT VERSE.

82
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,195
YOU COULD JUST GO, UH...

83
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,696
??
?? GREATEST OF EASE

84
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,198
??
?? BUM A NUMMA NUMMA...

85
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,699
AND THEN GO RIGHT INTO IT.

86
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,700
YEAH.

87
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,202
OOH, I LIKE THAT.

88
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,205
WAIT. HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT "BUM A NUMMA NUMMAS"?

89
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:29,209
WELL, UH... YOU KNOW, I USED TO PLAY.

90
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,710
OH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

91
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,212
THE KEYBOARDS, HUH?

92
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,214
YEAH. JUST A LITTLE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

93
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,716
I REALLY GOT INTO IT IN COLLEGE.

94
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,718
THAT'S WHEN I REALLY FOUND MY SOUND.

95
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,220

96
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,224
OH, GOD. ORANGE JUICE JUST CAME OUT OF MY NOSE

97
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,725
BUT IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT.

98
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,229
OH, MY GOD!

99
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,231
I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT YOUR SOUND.

100
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,233
YEAH.

101
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,735
HE USED TO LOCK HIMSELF IN THE BASEMENT FOR HOURS.

102
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:59,739
NO ONE WAS EVER ALLOWED TO HEAR "THE SOUND."

103
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,242
I WANT TO HEAR "THE SOUND."

104
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,244
NO. I MEAN...

105
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,246
NO. I HAVEN'T PLAYED IN SO LONG

106
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,248
AND, AND...

107
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,750
WELL, IT'S REALLY PERSONAL STUFF, YOU KNOW?

108
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,253
COME ON. PLAY THAT FUNKY MUSIC, WHITE BOY.

109
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,755
YEAH, COME ON.

110
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,257
NO, YOU GUYS.

111
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,260
MY KEYBOARDS ARE ALL THE WAY... YEAH, OKAY.

112
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,765
WHO WANTS TO GET DINNER LATER?

113
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,267
I WANT TO TRY THAT NEW ITALIAN RESTAURANT.

114
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,768
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE REALLY GOOD.

115
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,271
SAW A LOT OF CHINESE PEOPLE EATING IN THERE.

116
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,773
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

117
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,276
REMEMBER YOU SAID SOME RESTAURANT MUST BE REALLY GOOD

118
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,278
BECAUSE YOU SAW ALL THESE CHINESE PEOPLE EATING IN THERE?

119
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,781
THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS A CHINESE RESTAURANT.

120
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,284
OH. WELL... I STILL WANT TO GO,

121
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,785
WHO WANTS TO COME?

122
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,786
OH, I CAN'T.

123
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,289
I GOT TWO DINNER DATES TONIGHT

124
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,790
SO I GOT TO GET READY.

125
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,292
ALL RIGHT. GIRLS' NIGHT OUT.

126
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,294
SORRY, HONEY, BUT WE GOT TO PREP

127
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,296
THAT CATERING THING WE HAVE TOMORROW.

128
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,297
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

129
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,299
I WISH I WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

130
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,301
WHO COULD EAT IN RESTAURANTS ALONE.

131
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,302
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

132
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,803
IT'S A REALLY GOOD THING TO DO.

133
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,806
I THINK I WOULD FEEL REALLY SELF CONSCIOUS.

134
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,808
LIKE I WAS ON DISPLAY OR SOMETHING.

135
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,310
I WAS ON DISPLAY ONCE.

136
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,312
IT WAS NOTHING LIKE EATING ALONE.

137
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,325
I JUST HAD A GREAT TIME WITH MYSELF.

138
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,330
WELL, THIS COULD BE A GOOD STORY.

139
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,831
AT DINNER.

140
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,334
IT WAS SO LIBERATING, YOU KNOW?

141
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,336
I DON'T NEED PEOPLE TO HAVE FUN.

142
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,837
I'M FUN. I'M A FUN GIRL.

143
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,341
ARE YOU A NAUGHTY GIRL?

144
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,845
NO, JUST FUN. FUN. GOOD. FUN. YEAH.

145
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,847
SEE? I TOLD YOU YOU'D HAVE FUN.

146
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,350
ALTHOUGH I MUST SAY THAT I TOTALLY JUDGE

147
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,352
ANY WOMAN I SEE EATING ALONE.

148
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,854
WHAT IS WRONG WITH A WOMAN EATING ALONE?

149
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,856
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING-- SHE'S EATING ALONE.

150
00:05:58,858 --> 00:05:59,859
OKAY, GUYS.

151
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,862
ALL RIGHT, BRING IT ON, YOU.

152
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,866

153
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,867
HERE WE GO.

154
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,371

155
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,374

156
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,377
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER PLAYED MY STUFF

157
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,878
FOR ANYONE BEFORE

158
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,881
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND

159
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,884
IT'S ABOUT COMMUNICATING...

160
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,887
VERY PRIVATE EMOTIONS.

161
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,895
YOU KNOW, UM...

162
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,398
YOU SHOULD THINK OF, UM...

163
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,899
MY WORK

164
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,403
AS WORDLESS SOUND POEMS.

165
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,409
THAT'S WHAT...

166
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,910
OH, MY GOD. PLAY!

167
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,917

168
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,419

169
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,922

170
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,926

171
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,428

172
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,430

173
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,932

174
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,934

175
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:19,939

176
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,448
BOY, YOU KNOW, TH THAT WAS, UH...

177
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:30,950
TERRIFIC.

178
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,454
REALLY...

179
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,456
BITCHING.

180
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,459
WOW!

181
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,461
IT WAS SO... WOW!

182
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:42,962
REALLY? I MEAN, REALLY?

183
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,464
OH, YEAH!

184
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,967
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD... PLAY IN PUBLIC.

185
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,470
WOW! THANKS, YOU GUYS!

186
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,971
THAT'S, OH...

187
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,973
OH, I WANT TO PLAY YOU ANOTHER PIECE.

188
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,475
UM... OH!

189
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,479
I LEFT MY HELICOPTER SOUNDS ON ANOTHER DISK.

190
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,980
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY?

191
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,982
OH, THIS IS...

192
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,484
THIS IS SO NICE.

193
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,985
I MEAN, I AM SO...

194
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,494
OH, GOD BLESS MY DAD FOR SOUND PROOFING THE BASEMENT.

195
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,998
I CAN'T BELIEVE I EVER LET HIM TOUCH ME WITH THOSE FINGERS.

196
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,001
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

197
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,003
I LOVED IT!

198
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,506
IT WAS SO MOVING.

199
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,508
PLUS, IT'S SO DIFFERENT

200
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,510
FROM THE STUFF YOU USUALLY HEAR.

201
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,011
YOU MEAN MUSIC?

202
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,517

203
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,519
YEAH, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

204
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,523
YES, YES. YOUR BREASTS ARE JUST AS FIRM AND JUICY.

205
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,024

206
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,527
COME IN.

207
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,028
HEY.

208
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,531
OH, GOD. IS THAT BAYWATCH?

209
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,034
UH, YES, BUT, UH, I JUST WATCH IT FOR THE ARTICLES.

210
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,036
SO, IS JOEY AROUND?

211
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,540
NO. HE'S NOT BACK YET, BUT HE'S GOING TO BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

212
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,041
HAVE A SEAT. BOW OR STERN?

213
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,544
I DON'T REALLY HAVE A PREFERENCE. YOU?

214
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,546
WELL, I LIKE IT IN THE STERN.

215
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,050
OF THE BOAT.

216
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,052

217
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,053
HELLO.

218
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,555
HEY, IT'S ME.

219
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,057
LISTEN, CACEY AND I HAD A LITTLE CAR TROUBLE.

220
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,058
WHAT HAPPENED?

221
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,059
We broke down

222
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,060
ON THE PARKWAY.

223
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,062
I HAVE TO GET SOME TRANSMISSION FLUID.

224
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,065
COULD YOU PLEASE TELL KATHY I'M SORRY AND I'LL BE THERE SOON?

225
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,067
WHY CAN'T YOU TELL HER?

226
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,070
Because I only have one quarter and my time is about to...

227
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,072
JOEY? JOEY?

228
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,574
YEAH?

229
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,077
I THOUGHT YOUR TIME RAN OUT.

230
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,080
ME, TOO, BUT I GUESS I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF...

231
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,084
UH, THAT WAS JOEY.

232
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,587
HE'S RUNNING A LITTLE LATE AND HE SAYS HE'S SORRY.

233
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,089
SO I GUESS IT'S JUST YOU AND ME, THEN.

234
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,592
OH. OKAY.

235
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,594
YEAH. I THINK IT IS.

236
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,599
SO, WHAT DID YOU DO TODAY?

237
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,601
I HAD AN APPOINTMENT TO GET MY HAIR CUT...

238
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,602
IT LOOKS GREAT.

239
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,604
AND THEN IT GOT CANCELED.

240
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,607
WELL, I COULD CUT IT.

241
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,108
REALLY? DO YOU DO THAT?

242
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,610
YEAH, I DO.

243
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,612
I LEARNED IT IN MY AUNT'S DOG GROOMING SHOP

244
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,113
BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY?

245
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,115
DOG GROOMING, HUH?

246
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,618
OKAY, JUST DON'T MAKE MY TAIL TOO POOFY.

247
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,126
YOU HAVE REALLY GREAT HAIR.

248
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,127
WELL, THANKS.

249
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,629
I GROW IT MYSELF.

250
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,131
MMM!

251
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,633
MMM!

252
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,635
MMM...

253
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,637
YOU KNOW WHO ALSO HAS GREAT HAIR IS JOEY.

254
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,139
YES. YEAH, JOEY HAS GREAT HAIR.

255
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,141
UM, I'M BASICALLY DONE HERE.

256
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,644
LET ME JUST GET THIS HAIR OFF YOUR NECK.

257
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,659
WH WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

258
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,662
CHECKING TO SEE IF IT'S EVEN.

259
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,664
OKAY.

260
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,668
LOOKS GOOD.

261
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,671

262
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,672
AH, IT'S THE PHONE!

263
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,674
THE PHONE'S MAKING SOUNDS!

264
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,175
HELLO.

265
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,677
HEY, DUDE, IT'S ME.

266
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,678
HEY, IT'S JOEY.

267
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,179
OH.

268
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,181
WE'RE GOING TO BE STUCK HERE FOR A WHILE.

269
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,184
I GOT THE TRANSMISSION FLUID, WENT TO PUT IT IN THE CAR--

270
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,686
THE TRANSMISSION WASN'T THERE.

271
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,687
WHAT?

272
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,188
It must've fallen out

273
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,189
A FEW BLOCKS BACK.

274
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,691
I FIGURED WE HIT A DOG.

275
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,693
OH. OKAY.

276
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,194
Could you put Kathy on?

277
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,196
I want to apologize to her.

278
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,699
OH. YEAH, MAN. JOEY.

279
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,200
HEY.

280
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,702
OH, NO. IT'S FINE.

281
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,704
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

282
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,205
NO, STOP APOLOGIZING.

283
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,707
IT'S OKAY.

284
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,709
YEAH. I'LL TALK TO YOU TOMORROW.

285
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,714
I SHOULD, UH, PROBABLY GO.

286
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,716
YEAH. YES. YEAH.

287
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,726

288
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,731
I FORGOT MY PURSE.

289
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,232
OH.

290
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,239
OH! I REALLY DID.

291
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,240
I FORGOT MY PURSE.

292
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,742

293
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,747
OH, NO, NO, NO!

294
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,749
IT'S BAD. IT'S BAD. THIS IS BAD.

295
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,250
HORRIBLE.

296
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,253
WAIT, THE, UH, THE KISS, OR THE SITUATION?

297
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,255
NO, THE KISS WAS GOOD.

298
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,256
NO, BUT THAT'S BAD!

299
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,258
OH, YES! OKAY, HERE'S WHAT WE DO.

300
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,760
WE FORGET IT HAPPENED.

301
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,260
WHAT?

302
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,762
WE SWALLOW OUR FEELINGS

303
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,264
EVEN IF IT MEANS WE'RE UNHAPPY FOREVER.

304
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,265
SOUND GOOD?

305
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,268
CAN YOU REALLY DO THAT?

306
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,269
I HAVE TO.

307
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,772
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND...

308
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,774
AND YOU'RE SEEING HIM.

309
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,777
OH, CHANDLER, I LIKE JOEY A LOT

310
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,779
BUT WITH YOU...

311
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,280
OH, NO, NO, DON'T. SEE?

312
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,783
SEE, YOU'RE GETTING ME CONFUSED.

313
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,284
I'M STARTING TO YEARN.

314
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,789
I'M SORRY.

315
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,291
IF YOU WANT TO PRETEND THAT NOTHING HAPPENED

316
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,293
I CAN TRY.

317
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,797
I I THINK WE HAVE TO.

318
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,298
OKAY.

319
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,302
BYE.

320
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,303
BYE.

321
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,306

322
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,316
ARE YOU STILL OUT THERE?

323
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,318
NO.

324
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,326

325
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,329
ELECTRIFYING...

326
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,834
INFINITE TIME...

327
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,836
TIME... TIME... TIME...

328
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,840
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A STARBUCKS ABOUT THREE BLOCKS DOWN.

329
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,841
HE'S SO INSPIRED.

330
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,342
JUST LOOK AT HIM.

331
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,844
LOOK AT HIM GO.

332
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,846

333
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,848

334
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,855

335
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,860

336
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,863
THANK YOU, NEW YORK... NEW YORK... NEW YORK...

337
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,366
HEY, AREN'T YOU UP NEXT?

338
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,869
OH, NO. I'M NOT PLAYING TONIGHT.

339
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,870
WHY NOT?

340
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,873
I CAN'T FOLLOW ROSS.

341
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,374
ARE YOU KIDDING?

342
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,377
THAT WOULD BE LIKE THOSE POOR BICYCLE RIDING CHIMPS

343
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,380
WHO HAD TO FOLLOW THE BEATLES. NO.

344
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,884
PHOEBE, ROSS SUCKS.

345
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,387
PHOEBE, THE PLACE HAS EMPTIED

346
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,388
BECAUSE OF HIM.

347
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,891
OH, MY GOD, HE'S NOT EVEN APPRECIATED

348
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,893
IN HIS OWN TIME.

349
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,894
I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING

350
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,897
TO NOT BE APPRECIATED IN MY OWN TIME!

351
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,902
OKAY. UM, PHOEBE...

352
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,405
YOU SUCK, TOO.

353
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,410
YEAH, PHOEBE, YOU'RE...

354
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,912
AWFUL!

355
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,417
YOU GUYS.

356
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,920
"YEAH, YOU SUCK, TOO."

357
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:25,925
OH, MAN!

358
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,930
I CAN'T BELIEVE I LOCKED MYSELF OUT AGAIN!

359
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,432
HANG ON, BUDDY.

360
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,937
OH, MY GOD.

361
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,938
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

362
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:39,939
DID YOU DO ALL THIS?

363
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,940
I SURE DID.

364
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,441
WHY?

365
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,443
I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL GOOD

366
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,945
TO DO SOMETHING NICE FOR MY FRIEND.

367
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,446
YOU'RE AMAZING.

368
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,948
NO, NO, NO.

369
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,450
THIS IS AMAZING.

370
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,454
A TV THAT APPEARS AS IF FROM NOWHERE!

371
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,457
THAT'S THE DREAM!

372
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,460
HOW DID YOU AFFORD ALL THIS STUFF?!

373
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,962
WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M 29.

374
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,463
I MEAN, WHO NEEDS A SAVINGS ACCOUNT?

375
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,466
YOU ARE THE BEST FRIEND ANYONE HAS EVER HAD.

376
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,969
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

377
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,971
NO, NO, NO. YOU ARE.

378
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,473
YOU DO THIS, YOU GIVE ME THE GREAT ADVICE

379
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,976
AND LISTEN, I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID YESTERDAY

380
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,978
ABOUT FOCUSING ON ONE WOMAN?

381
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:19,979
I'M GOING TO DO THAT.

382
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,480
YOU MEAN WITH CACEY?

383
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,983
NO. I THINK I'LL SEE HOW THINGS GO WITH KATHY.

384
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,984
SHE'S PRETTY COOL.

385
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:25,985
OR CACEY.

386
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,986
NO, NO, KATHY.

387
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,487
COULD BE CACEY.

388
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:29,989
NO, NO, KATHY.

389
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:30,990
CONSIDER CACEY.

390
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,492
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

391
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,994
I THINK SOMEBODY'S

392
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,996
GOT A LITTLE CRUSH ON CACEY.

393
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,497
HOW ABOUT I FIX YOU TWO UP?

394
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:39,999
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

395
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,001
THAT ALL THE PIECES OF MY LIFE

396
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,003
ARE FALLING RIGHT INTO PLACE.

397
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,012
HEY.

398
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,513
HEY. YOU WERE REALLY GREAT.

399
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,515
YOU WERE REALLY, REALLY GREAT.

400
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,516
THANKS.

401
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,518
THANKS.

402
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,519
SO, MONICA TELLS ME

403
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,522
THAT, UH, YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY ANYMORE

404
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,523
BECAUSE OF ME

405
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,027
AND, YOU KNOW, MY TALENT.

406
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,528
IS THAT TRUE?

407
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,529
WELL...

408
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,031
KIND OF, YEAH. YEAH.

409
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,032
PHEEBS...

410
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,533
YEAH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW

411
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,537
AND I WAS TRYING TO BE REALLY, YOU KNOW, OKAY AND UPBEAT ABOUT IT

412
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,040
BUT I FEEL SO... DWARFED BY YOUR MUSICAL GIFT.

413
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,042
I...

414
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,543
SEE, BUT PHEEBS

415
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,546
THAT IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE INTENT

416
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,048
OF MY MUSIC.

417
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,551
MY MUSIC IS MEANT TO INSPIRE

418
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,553
AND IF IT BOTHERS YOU THIS MUCH

419
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,056
THEN I...

420
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,557
I WON'T PLAY ANYMORE.

421
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,060
OH, NO.

422
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,561
NO, NO, NO. DON'T DO THAT.

423
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,563
HOW COULD I LIVE WITH MYSELF

424
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,067
IF I KNEW I WAS DEPRIVING THE WORLD OF YOUR MUSIC?

425
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,570
YEAH, OKAY.

426
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,578
I'D LOVE TO, BUT I HAVE PLANS ON SUNDAY.

427
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,080
MAYBE SOME OTHER TIME.

428
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,081
SURE. GIVE ME A CALL.

429
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,082
I'M IN THE BOOK.

430
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,583
OKAY. THANKS A LOT.

431
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,085
SEE YOU.

432
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,090
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

433
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,591
HE IS CUTE AND HE'S A DOCTOR.

434
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,093
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

435
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,595
HONEY, I EAVESDROP BECAUSE I CARE.

436
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,099
WELL, I HAVE PLANS ON SUNDAY.

437
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:20,599
WITH WHO?

438
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,101
ME.

439
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,103
OH, GOD.

440
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,604
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOLD ME

441
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,606
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO SPEND TIME ALONE.

442
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,108
I CAN'T JUST GO OUT WITH THAT GUY

443
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,609
WHEN I HAVE PLANS WITH MYSELF.

444
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,111
IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO ME.

445
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,113
SO, BASICALLY, YOU'RE SAYING

446
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,615
YOU DON'T WANT TO CHEAT ON YOURSELF.

447
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:40,119
WELL, IF YOU WANT TO MAKE ME SOUND CRAZY...

448
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,122
SAW THE NEW FURNITURE.

449
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,124
VERY NICE.

450
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,126
YEAH. JOEY HAS THE BEST BOYFRIEND EVER.

451
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,130
I KISSED KATHY.

452
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,631
ARE YOU SERIOUS? MY GOD!

453
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:53,632
DOES JOEY KNOW?

454
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:54,633
NO.

455
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,135
IS THERE ANY WAY--

456
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,637
ANY WAY YOU THINK HE WILL UNDERSTAND THIS?

457
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,140
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVEN'T SCREWED OVER

458
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,141
A LOT OF YOUR FRIENDS.

459
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,144
WHICH WE ALL APPRECIATE.

460
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,645
YOU KNOW, THE SAD THING IS

461
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,648
IF YOU HAD TOLD HIM HOW YOU FELT BEFORE YOU KISSED HER

462
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,651
KNOWING JOEY, HE PROBABLY JUST WOULD'VE STEPPED ASIDE.

463
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,153
OH, DON'T SAY THAT.

464
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,154
DON'T SAY THAT.

465
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,156
THAT'S NOT TRUE, IS IT?

466
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,657
YEAH. HE LOVES YOU. YEAH.

467
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,660
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME TO DO THAT?!

468
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,661
I DON'T KNOW.

469
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,163
I I SAID SOMETHING TO PHOEBE.

470
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,166
THAT'S RIGHT, AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A REALLY GOOD IDEA.

471
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,167
YEAH, I REMEMBER.

472
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,168
YOU DID.

473
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,669
OH, MY GOD!

474
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,670
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

475
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,671
WELL, CHANDLER

476
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,673
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TELL HIM.

477
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,675
WHY? WHY DO I HAVE TO TELL HIM?

478
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,676
BECAUSE YOU DO.

479
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,678
YEAH, I KNOW.

480
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,681
HEY.

481
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,684
WOULD IT BE OKAY IF I WROTE A SONG ABOUT THIS?

482
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,691
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS WORKING OUT.

483
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:57,696
I THINK... I THINK I WANT TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE.

484
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,699
WOW! DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.

485
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,701
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T ENJOY THIS.

486
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,203
I DO.

487
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,206
I JUST WANT TO SEE WHAT ELSE IS OUT THERE.

488
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,210
HEY. HEY, GUY.

489
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,711
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

490
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,213
I WORK ACROSS THE STREET.

491
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,216
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT TURNS OUT I'M GOING TO BE FREE SUNDAY.

492
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,717
OH, YOU KNOW, I WISH YOU HAD CALLED ME.

493
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,719
I JUST TOLD THEM I'D WORK THIS WEEKEND.

494
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,721
OH. OKAY. WELL, MAYBE NEXT WEEKEND.

495
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,722
DEFINITELY.

496
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,224
I'LL SEE YOU. OKAY.

497
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,226
YEAH, YOU'LL BE TALKING TO ME NEVER

498
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,727
BECAUSE YOU'RE A FREAK WHO EATS ALONE.

499
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,235
HEY.

500
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,236
HEY.

501
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,737
Wonder  Steve?

502
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,738
SAMBUCA MARGARITA?

503
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,739
Are you here?

504
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,241
IS THAT A REAL THING?

505
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,244
WELL, WE ONLY HAD SAMBUCA, SO IT IS NOW.

506
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,746
LISTEN, UH, JOE, I I NEED TO--

507
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,249
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

508
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,751
WHAT'S UP?

509
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,752

510
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,754
IT'S, IT'S ABOUT KATHY.

511
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,256
UM...

512
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,257
UH...

513
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,258
I LIKE HER.

514
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,761
I LIKE HER A LOT, ACTUALLY.

515
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,763
YOU DO?

516
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,265
YEAH.

517
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,267
WELL, YOUR TIMING COULDN'T BE BETTER

518
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,769
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND ANYMORE.

519
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,770
WHAT?

520
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,273
YEAH, SHE BROKE UP WITH ME.

521
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,775
OH, UH... WHEN?

522
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,277
JUST NOW, AFTER ACTING CLASS.

523
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,280
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT SHE WAS DOING SOME KIND OF SCENE.

524
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,282
THAT'S WHY I LET PEOPLE WATCH.

525
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,784
OH... MAN, I AM SO SORRY.

526
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,787
ARE YOU, ARE ARE YOU OKAY?

527
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,790
I'VE BEEN BETTER, YOU KNOW, BUT I'M ALL RIGHT.

528
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,292
SO, YOU LIKE HER, HUH?

529
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,793
YES, BUT I, I, I DON'T HAVE TO.

530
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,794
NO, NO, NO.

531
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,296
IT'S, UH...

532
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,797
IT'S OKAY.

533
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,299
YEAH?

534
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,800
YEAH.

535
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,801
YOU KNOW WHY?

536
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,304
BECAUSE YOU CAME TO ME FIRST.

537
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,809
WELL, I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE THE BEST THING TO DO.

538
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,811
BUT, HEY, LISTEN, JUST SO YOU KNOW--

539
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,314
YOU MIGHT HAVE YOUR WORK CUT OUT FOR YOU

540
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,316
BECAUSE, WHEN I TALKED TO HER

541
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,817
I KIND OF GOT THE FEELING

542
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,819
SHE'S INTO SOME OTHER GUY, SO...

543
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,821
SEE, UH, THAT'S, THAT'S ACTUALLY

544
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,823
WHAT I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

545
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:08,827
I I THINK I KNOW WHO THE OTHER GUY IS.

546
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,829
WHO?

547
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,332
IT'S ME.

548
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,334
I'M THE OTHER GUY.

549
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,836
WHAT?

550
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,839
YEAH, I MEAN, WHEN YOU WERE LATE LAST NIGHT

551
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,342
KATHY AND I GOT TO TALKING AND...

552
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,345
ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER AND...

553
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,346
AND WHAT?

554
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,847
DID YOU SLEEP WITH HER?

555
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,849
NO! NO, NO, I JUST KISSED HER.

556
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,851
WHAT?! THAT'S EVEN WORSE!

557
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,353
HOW IS THAT WORSE?!

558
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,355
I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S THE SAME!

559
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,359
LOOK, I'M SORRY, BUT THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO.

560
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,361
I THINK I'M IN LOVE WITH HER.

561
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,363
WHO CARES! YOU WENT BEHIND MY BACK?!

562
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,864
I'D NEVER DO THAT TO YOU!

563
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,865
YOU'RE RIGHT.

564
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,866
I HAVE NO EXCUSES.

565
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,368
I WAS TOTALLY OVER THE LINE.

566
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,369
"OVER THE LINE"?

567
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,871
Y Y YOU'RE, YOU'RE SO FAR PAST THE LINE

568
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,373
THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE THE LINE!

569
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,874
THE LINE IS A DOT TO YOU.

570
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,875
YES.

571
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,877
YES, RIGHT, AND I FEEL HORRIBLE.

572
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,879
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

573
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,880
OH, MY GOD.

574
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,883
IS THAT WHY YOU BOUGHT ALL THIS STUFF?!

575
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,886
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

576
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,889
I WILL NOT WATCH YOUR TV, I WILL NOT LISTEN TO YOUR STEREO

577
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,393
AND THERE'S A CINNAMON RAISIN LOAF IN THE NEW BREAD MAKER

578
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,894
THAT I'M NOT GOING TO EAT!

579
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,895
YOU KNOW WHY?

580
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:17,896
PROBABLY BECAUSE...

581
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,398
BECAUSE IT'S ALL TAINTED

582
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,899
WITH YOUR BETRAYAL.

583
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,903
FROM NOW ON, THIS APARTMENT IS EMPTY TO ME!

584
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,406
I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT YOU EITHER.

585
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,911

586
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,914
OH, AND JUST SO YOU KNOW...

587
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,417
I MADE THAT BREAD FOR YOU.

588
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,920

589
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,429

590
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,431

591
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,932
OH, MY GOD. HE'S LOST IT.

592
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,434
HE'S TOTALLY LOST IT.

593
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:57,936
WHAT?

594
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,938
PHOEBE, THIS IS MUSIC

595
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,440
THAT CANNOT GET ANY WORSE.

596
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,941
THERE ARE RATS IN THE BASEMENT

597
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,943
THAT ARE HANGING THEMSELVES.

598
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:10,949

599
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,954
THANK YOU.

600
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,456
THANKS.

601
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,461
YEAH, I LOST IT.

602
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,964
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY ANYMORE.

603
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,466
WOULD YOU...?

604
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,967
CAN YOU FINISH MY SET?

605
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,470
AFTER THAT? YEAH!

606
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:36,475
NO, I MEAN, IF I CAN HELP, YEAH.

607
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,982
YEAH, LIKE I COULD LOSE IT.

608
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,485
WHAT?

609
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,488
I PLAYED BAD ON PURPOSE, GUYS.

610
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,989
OH! OH!

611
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,992
OKAY, SO YOU WERE TRYING TO PLAY BAD THIS WHOLE TIME?

612
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,994
NO, JUST THAT LAST SONG.
