1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,004
HEY. HI.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,005
SORRY I'M LATE.

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,506
DID I MISS ANYTHING?

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,509
WELL, JOEY STUFFING 15 OREOS IN HIS MOUTH.

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,511
FIFTEEN?

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,014
YOUR PERSONAL BEST. YEAH.

7
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,515
MM MM.

8
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,020
SO, WHERE WERE YOU?

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,521
OH, ON A DATE.

10
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,522
I MET THIS GIRL ON THE TRAIN

11
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,024
GOING TO A MUSEUM UPSTATE.

12
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
OH, YEAH, HOW'D YOU MEET HER? WHICH MUSEUM?

13
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,529
NO. ANSWER HIS.

14
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:33,033
OKAY, IT WAS JUST ME AND HER AT THE BACK OF THE TRAIN

15
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,036
AND I SAT NEAR THE DOOR SO SHE'D HAVE TO PASS BY ME

16
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,038
IF SHE WANTED TO, LIKE, SWITCH CARS.

17
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,540
SHE WAS TOTALLY AT MY MERCY.

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,043
WERE YOU SO LATE BECAUSE YOU WERE BURYING THIS WOMAN?

19
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,544
NO, I'M GETTING BACK NOW

20
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,546
BECAUSE SHE LIVES IN POUGHKEEPSIE.

21
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,048
SHE SEEMS REALLY GREAT

22
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,550
BUT SHE'S, LIKE, TWO AND A HALF HOURS AWAY.

23
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,553
HOW CAN SHE BE GREAT IF SHE'S FROM POUGHKEEPSIE?

24
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:58,058
OKAY, THAT JOKE WOULD'VE KILLED IN ALBANY.

25
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,059
DONE.

26
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,560
I DID IT.

27
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,563
HUH. WHO'S STUPID NOW, HUH?

40
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,114
HEY, THEY'RE LIGHTING

41
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,615
THE BIG CHRISTMAS TREE TONIGHT.

42
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,118
UM, THAT PAPER'S TWO WEEKS OLD.

43
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,622
ALL RIGHT, WHO KEEPS LEAVING OLD NEWSPAPERS IN THE TRASH?

44
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,126
I REALLY WANTED TO TAKE KATHY TO THIS.

45
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,627
I CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED IT.

46
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,129
HEY, YOU KNOW, AT LEAST

47
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,631
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY TO MISS THAT STUFF WITH.

48
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,633
I HATE BEING ALO NE THIS TIME OF YEAR.

49
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,136
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, IT'LL BE VALENTINE'S DAY

50
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,637
THEN MY BIRTHDAY, THEN BANG--

51
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:21,141
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT , THEY'RE LIGHTING THAT DAMN TREE AGAIN.

52
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,644
OH, I WANT SOMEBODY.

53
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,150
YOU KNOW? I WANT AMAN.

54
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,155
I MEAN

55
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,657
IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE A BIG RELATIONSHIP.

56
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,659
YOU KNOW, JUST A FLING WOULD BE GREAT.

57
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,163
REALLY? I DIDN'T THINK GIRLS EVER JUST WANTED A FLING.

58
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,165
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

59
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,667
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE BEEN FLUNG.

60
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:51,171
WELL, I KNOW WHAT I'M GIVING YOU FOR CHRISTMAS.

61
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,175
THERE ARE SOME NICE GUYS

62
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,176
AT MY OFFICE.

63
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,177
YOU WANT ME TO SET YOU UP?

64
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,678
YEAH. WAIT A MINUTE.

65
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,181
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIM E THAT I'VE BEEN SINGLE.

66
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,183
HOW COME YOU'VE NE VER OFFERED THIS BEFORE?

67
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,185
WELL, I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

68
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,186
I'M... I'M HAPPY.

69
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,189
SO, I NO LONGER FEEL THE NEED TO GO OUT OF MY WAY

70
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,191
TO STOP OTHERS FROM BEING HAPPY.

71
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,193
OKAY.

72
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,194
BUT NO ACCOUNTANTS.

73
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,196
OH, AND NO ONE FROM, LIKE, "LEGAL."

74
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,698
I DON'T LIKE GUYS WITH BORING JOBS.

75
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,201
OH, AND ROSS WAS LIKE, WHAT, A LION TAMER?

76
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,705
HEY! HEY.

77
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,207
WHAT'S WRONG, MON?

78
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,210
EVERYBODY AT THE RESTAURANT STILL HATES ME.

79
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,212
IS IT BECAUSE OF THE REVIEW YOU WROTE

80
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,713
OR SOMETHING NEW?

81
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,216
IT'S THE REVIEW. YEAH.

82
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,218
I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING HEADWAY.

83
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,720
EVERYONE WAS SMILING AT ME ALL DAY

84
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,222
AND THEN I GET OFF WORK

85
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,224
AND FIND OUT THAT THEY WROTE THIS...

86
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,226
ON MY CHEF'S HAT.

87
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,232
HEY, MAYBE THEY MEANT TO WRITE "QUIET, BITCH."

88
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,240
HEY, HONEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

89
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,742
FINE, JUST TRYING TO BE NICE.

90
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,246
I HAVE NOT BEEN PICKED ON THIS MUCH

91
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,747
SINCE I WAS IN KINDERGARTEN

92
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,750
AND THEY HAD TO BRING IN SOMEONE FROM JUNIOR HIGH

93
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,252
TO DO THE SEESAW WITH ME.

94
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,753

95
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,756
AW...

96
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,259
THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE ME QUIT.

97
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,261
IF IT WERE ANY OTHER JOB, I WOULD

98
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,262
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING

99
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,264
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR MY WHOLE LIFE.

100
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,265
HONEY, YOU'RE THE BOSS.

101
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,766
WHY DON'T YOU JUST YELL AT THEM?

102
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,268
OR FIRE THEM?

103
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,270
I WOULD LOVE TO, BUT I CAN'T.

104
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,772
YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOOD AT CONFRONTATION.

105
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,274
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU COULD DO?

106
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,276
I REMEMBER READING ABOUT THIS DIRECTOR--

107
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,777
I THINK IT WAS ORSON WELLES--

108
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,780
WHO, AT THE BEGINNING OF A MOVIE, WOULD HIRE SOMEBODY

109
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,283
JUST SO HE COULD FIRE THEM IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

110
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,285
THEN THEY WOULD ALL KNOW WHO WAS BOSS.

111
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,288
HEY, MON, I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

112
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,789
WHY DON'T YOU

113
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,291
FIRE ME?

114
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,292
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

115
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,294
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO WAITER?

116
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,296
GOOD ENOUGH TO GET FIRED.

117
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,797
ALL RIGHT.

118
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,798
YOU'RE HIRED.

119
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,800
HEY. OH.

120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,802
THAT MUST BE WHY I GOT FIRED LAST WEEK.

121
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,806
DOES THIS ORSON WELLES GUY DIRECT BURGER KING COMMERCIALS?

122
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,313
YES.

123
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,823
I SAY, DREW

124
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,326
ARE YOU SEEING ANYBODY RIGHT NOW?

125
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,329
UH, UH, I'M NOT ASKING FOR ME. UH...

126
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,331
I'M, I'M NOT, I'M NOT GAY.

127
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,832
I'M NOT ASKING YOU OUT.

128
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,334
I I I'M NOT GAY.

129
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,336
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE GAY.

130
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,337
I DO NOW.

131
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,342
SEE, MY FRIEND, MY FRIEND, RACHEL

132
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,343
SHE WANTS TO BE SET UP.

133
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,845
AH. I JUST GOT OUT OF A BIG RELATIONSHIP.

134
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,347
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS.

135
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,348
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW

136
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,349
THAT MIGHT BE OKAY.

137
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,351
EVEN IF IT WAS JUST KIND OF A FLING

138
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,353
THAT MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT WITH RACHEL.

139
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,854
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

140
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,356
IS THIS "HOT RACHEL THAT YOU TOOK

141
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,358

142
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,360
OH, BY THE WAY, THAT IS HER FULL NAME.

143
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,861
OH, WOW. I'M FREE FOR HER.

144
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,862
WAIT A SECOND.

145
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,364
I DIDN'T SAY I WASN'T FREE.

146
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,365
WHY DON'T WE

147
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,366
TALK THIS OVER

148
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,367
AT THE RANGER GAME TOMORROW?

149
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,868
HOLD ON.

150
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,870
YOU KNOW, I JUST GOT A BOX OF CUBANS.

151
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,872
MAYBE I BRING THEM BY YOUR OFFICE

152
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,873
AROUND, UH, 5:00?

153
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,375
WELL, THAT'S A LITTLE LATER

154
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,377
THAN I, UH, GENERALLY CARE TO STAY

155
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,378
BUT SURE.

156
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,879
MAYBE, BEFORE THE GAME

157
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,882
WE CAN ENJOY SOME EIGHT YEAR OLD SMALL BATCH BASIL HAYDENS.

158
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,385
WELL, I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT IS

159
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,387
BUT THAT'S A PRETTY NICE JACKET.

160
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,893
I KIND OF LIKE THAT TIE, TOO.

161
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,899
KEEP YOUR PANTS ON, MAN.

162
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,408
HEY, YOU GUYS, I'M WRITING A HOLIDAY SONG FOR EVERYONE.

163
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,409
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR IT?

164
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,911
YEAH. YES.

165
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,414
OKAY.

166
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,915

167
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,419
??
?? HAPPY HANUKKAH, MONICA

168
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,423

169
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,927

00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,435
PHEEBS, IT'S GREAT.

172
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,436
OH, YAY!

173
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,937
BUT YOU KNOW, UH...

174
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,440
"RACHEL" DOESN'T RHYME WITH "DREIDEL."

175
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,941
I KNOW, BUT IT'S SO HARD.

176
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,444
NOTHING RHYMES WITH YOUR STUPID NAME.

177
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,446
WHAT ARE YOU

178
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,947
TALKING ABOUT?

179
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,449
LOTS OF THINGS RHYME WITH RACHEL.

180
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,453
BAGEL, MALE, JAIL, BAIL, CABLE

181
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,955
MAY POLE...

182
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,957
ALL GOOD. THANKS.

183
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,461
DO YOU MAYBE HAVE A NICKNAME

184
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,962
THAT'S EASIER TO RHYME?

185
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:43,963
DIDN'T YOUR DAD

186
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,465
USED TO CALL YOU "PUMPKIN?"

187
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,966
OH, YEAH. PUMPKIN? YEAH?

188
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,969
BUT DID HE EVER CALL YOU, LIKE, "BOODOLPH?"

189
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,973
HELLO, CHILDREN.

190
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,975

191
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,978
HAVE I GOT THE 50 GUYS FOR YOU!

192
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,480
REALLY?

193
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,982
I SHOWED THEM THIS PICTURE OF YOU

194
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,484
AND GUYS WERE BUYING ME DRINKS

195
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,485
GIVING ME STUFF.

196
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,486
KNICKS TONIGHT?

197
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,987
SURE. WHERE ARE THE SEATS?

198
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,989
WHEREVER. I'VE GOT, LIKE, 20.

199
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,993
SO, WILL I LIKE ANY OF THESE GUYS?

200
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,495
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

201
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,996
I'M GOING TO, UH...

202
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,499
I'M GOING TO PLAY THE FIELD JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE.

203
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,000
CHANDLER...

204
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,503
GUYS ARE SIGNING OVER THEIR 401s TO ME.

205
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,005
YOU WORK WITH ROBOTS?

206
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,511
YES.

207
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,515
OKAY, THERE IS THIS ONE GUY, PATRICK.

208
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,017
HE'S REALLY NICE, HE'S FUNNY, HE'S A SWIMMER.

209
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,519
OH, I LIKE SWIMMERS' BODIES.

210
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,020
AND HIS FATHER

211
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,022
INVENTED THAT MAGNETIC STRIP ON CREDIT CARDS.

212
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,024
OH! I LIKE CREDIT CARDS.

213
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,025
SEE? NOT BAD

214
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,027
AT THIS "FIXING UP" THING, HUH?

215
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,028
SO, WHAT DOES HE DO?

216
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,030
HE WORKS IN THE FINE FOODS DIVISION.

217
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,532
YOUR COMPANY HAS A FINE FOODS DIVISION?

218
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,534
IT'S A BIG COMPANY.

219
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,535
I... IF YOU...

220
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,036
NOW, WAIT A SECOND.

221
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,038
YOU MAKE FOOD AND ROBOTS?

222
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,039
NO.

223
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,543
NO, THE ROBOTS JUST WORK FOR THEM.

224
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,046
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO GO TO WORK.

225
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,549
DOES ANYBODY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

226
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,550
YEAH, LADY, I DO.

227
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,051
I GOT

228
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,052
A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

229
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,053
YOU WANT A PROBLEM?

230
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,555
I'LL GIVE YOU A PROBLEM.

231
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,057
OH, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, FIRE ME?

232
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,560
YOU BET YOUR ASS I'M GOING TO FIRE YOU.

233
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,561
SEE YOU LATER.

234
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,062
THANKS.

235
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,068
OH, WOW, I SHOULD GET GOING.

236
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,570
I'VE GOT A DATE TONIGHT.

237
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,071
OH, YEAH? WITH WHO?

238
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,574
YOU KNOW THAT GIRL WHO LIVES IN POUGHKEEPSIE?

239
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,074
YEAH.

240
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,576
NOT HER.

241
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,078
YEAH, THIS IS SOMEONE ELSE I MET

242
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,581
AND I I CAN'T DECIDE BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM.

243
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,583
YOU KNOW, THE ONE FROM POUGHKEEPSIE

244
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,586
EVEN THOUGH SHE'S A TWO HOUR TRAIN RIDE AWAY

245
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,088
IS REALLY PRETTY, REALLY SMART, AND A LOT OF FUN

246
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,590
BUT THIS OTHER GIRL...

247
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,592
WELL, SHE LIVES RIGHT UPTOWN.

248
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,093
WELL, SHE'S...

249
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:58,097
WELL, SHE'S, SHE'S JUST AS PRETTY.

250
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,600
I GUESS SHE'S SMART.

251
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,602
SHE'S NOT FUN.

252
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,104
IF SHE'S NO FUN

253
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,106
WHY DO YOU WANT TO DATE HER AT ALL?

254
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,109
WELL, I WANT TO GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE, YOU KNOW?

255
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,611
SHE LIVES SO CLOSE.

256
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,113
AND, AT THE END OF THE DATE THE OTHER TIME

257
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,116
SHE SAID SOMETHING THAT WAS-- IF SHE WAS KIDDING--

258
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,117
WAS VERY FUNNY.

259
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,119
ON THE OTHER HAND

260
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,122
IF SHE WASN'T KIDDING, SHE'S NOT FUN, SHE'S STUPID

261
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,624
AND KIND OF A RACIST.

262
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,627
HEY. HEY.

263
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,128
HEY, MAN.

264
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,631
OOH, HOW WAS YOUR FIRST DAY WORKING AT THE RESTAURANT?

265
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,132
DAMN!

266
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,140
HEY. HEY.

267
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,643
OH, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FANCY CHEF JACKET?

268
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,644
THEY BAKED IT.

269
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,145
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

270
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,647
I'M GOING TO CALL A MEETING.

271
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,148
I'M GOING TO FIRE YOU TONIGHT.

272
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,149
YOU GOT IT.

273
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,150
OH, OH!

274
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,652
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

275
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,654
YOU'RE STILL A TINY BIT ON FIRE THERE.

276
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,155
OH... THANKS.

277
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,157
LISTEN, I THINK YOU GOT IT.

278
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,664
OH, CHANDLER!

279
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,166
YOU HAVE THE BEST TASTE IN MEN.

280
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,669
WELL, LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON.

281
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,673
PATRICK AND I HAD SUCH A GREAT TIME LAST NIGHT.

282
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,174
I MEAN, I THINK THIS

283
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,176
COULD TURN INTO SOMETHING SERIOUS.

284
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,178
REALLY? I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T EVEN LOOKING

285
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,680
FOR SOMETHING SERIOUS.

286
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,683
I THOUGHT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF A FLING.

287
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,184
WELL, YOU KNOW, POSSIBLY.

288
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,689
YOU DIDN'T... TELL HIM THAT, THOUGH... RIGHT?

289
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,691
W'UH...

290
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,693
NO?

291
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,696
YOU TOLD THIS GUY THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR A FLING?!

292
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,698
YOU DON'T TELL THE GUY THAT!

293
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,199
I'D BE THRILLED IF I HEARD

294
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,702
THAT SOME HOT GIRL WAS JUST LOOKING TO GET...

295
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,703
OH, I SEE.

296
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,706
OH! BETWEEN YOU TELLING HIM I WANTED TO HAVE A FLING

297
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,708
AND ME PUTTING OUT ON THE FIRST DATE

298
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,210
OH, HE'S SO GOING TO GET THE WRONG IDEA!

299
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,717
JOEY, COULD YOU PASS THE CHEESE?

300
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,218
YEAH. LISTEN, I'D PREFER IT

301
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,219
IF YOU WOULDN'T

302
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,220
CALL ME JOEY.

303
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,222
SINCE I DON'T KNOW ANYONE HERE

304
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,223
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE FUN

305
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,225
TO TRY OUT A COOL WORK NICKNAME.

306
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,226
HEY, DRAGON.

307
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,731
HERE'S YOUR TIPS FROM MONDAY AND TUESDAY.

308
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,234
OH. LOOKS LIKE THERE'S, LIKE, 300 BUCKS IN THIS ONE.

309
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,236
YEAH, PEOPLE GET PRETTY GENEROUS

310
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,237
AROUND THE HOLIDAYS.

311
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,740
AND IT NEVER HURTS TO WEAR TIGHT TROUSERS.

312
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,743
OKAY.

313
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,745
WOULD THE WAITERS GATHER 'ROUND

314
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,246
TO HEAR TONIGHT'S SPECIALS?

315
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,748
FIRST, THERE'S A CHILEAN SEA BASS

316
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,250
PREPARED WITH A MANGO RELISH ON A BED...

317
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,252
WHY IS NOBODY WRITING THESE DOWN?

318
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,754
BECAUSE WE CAN REMEMBER THEM.

319
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,757
AND BECAUSE YOU'RE ALL GOING TO MAKE UP FAKE SPECIALS

320
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,758
AND MAKE ME COOK THEM

321
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,260
LIKE YOU DID THE OTHER NIGHT?

322
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,762
WELL, SURE, THAT, TOO.

323
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,765
OKAY. FORGET THE SPECIALS FOR A MINUTE.

324
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,768
UM, ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE THING.

325
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,771
FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS, I HAVE, UH...

326
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:56,275
TRIED REALLY HARD TO CREATE A POSITIVE ATMOSPHERE.

327
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,277
CAN'T HEAR YOU.

328
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,781
A POSITIVE ATMOSPHERE...

329
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,283
BUT I I'VE HAD IT UP TO HERE.

330
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:12,291
FROM NOW ON, IT IS GOING TO BE MY WAY...

331
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,795
OR THE HIGHWAY, ALL RIGHT?

332
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,799
DOES ANYBODY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

333
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,308
HEY, NEW GUY?

334
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,310
I SAID...

335
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,813
DOES ANYBODY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

336
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,816
NO, MA'AM.

337
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,819
HEY, HE HAS A NAME.

338
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,320
IT'S DRAGON.

339
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,323
YOU WANT TO KNOW YOUR NAME?

340
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,825
CHECK YOUR HAT.

341
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,326
WE DID THE HAT, RIGHT?

342
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,330
WHAT HAPPENED? I AM SO SORRY.

343
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,833
I WAS GOING TO DO IT. REALLY.

344
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,335
BUT THEN I WAS STANDING THERE

345
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,337
WITH $327 DOLLAR IN ONE HAND

346
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,339
AND $238 DOLLAR IN THE OTHER HAND

347
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,842
AND I WAS THINKING, "WOW.

348
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,845
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I HAD..."

349
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,848
327 PLUS $238 DOLLAR.

350
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,850
JOEY, WE HAD A DEAL.

351
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,351
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.

352
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,853
I'VE GOT TO FIRE YOU.

353
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,855
AND I'VE GOT TO PAY RENT.

354
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,356

355
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,357
LOOK.

356
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,859
HOW ABOUT THIS?

357
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,860
YOU DON'T FIRE ME.

358
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,862
INSTEAD, I STAY HERE, I GAIN THEIR TRUST

359
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,364
AND THEY'LL START LISTENING TO ALL THE NICE THINGS

360
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,366
I'VE BEEN SAYING ABOUT YOU.

361
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,869
WHAT KIND OF THINGS YOU BEEN SAYING?

362
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,870
NOTHING YET.

363
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,371
THEY REALLY HATE YOU

364
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,873
AND I WANT TO FIT IN.

365
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,875
?? HAPPY, HAPPY HANUKKAH ??

366
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,876
?
?? CHANDLER AND MONICA ?

367
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,377
?
?? MERRY, MERRY... ?

368
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,379
OOH, YOU KNOW... YOU KNOW WHAT, PHEEBS?

369
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,882
I'M NOT JEWISH, SO...

370
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,885
SO ROSS DOESN'T REALLY DECORATE HIS TREE WITH FLOSS

371
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,888
BUT YOU DON'T HEAR HIM COMPLAINING, DO YOU? GOD!

372
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,389

373
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,391
WHAT?

374
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,893
BAD DREAM?

375
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,395
I WASN'T SLEEPING.

376
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,897
OH, YEAH?

377
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,899
THEN WHAT WAS PHOEBE'S SONG ABOUT?

378
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,902
THE ONE WITH THE CAT.

379
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,405
I GOT TO GO.

380
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,908
I GOT ANOTHER DATE.

381
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,910
OH, SO DID YOU PICK ONE YET?

382
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,411
NO.

383
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,914
IT TURNS OUT THE ONE FROM UPTOWN WAS MAKING A JOKE

384
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,416
BUT IT WAS A DIFFERENT JOKE THAN I THOUGHT.

385
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,417
IT WASN'T THAT FUNNY.

386
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,921
SO I'M STILL TORN.

387
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,923
YOU DON'T REALLY LIKE THE ONE UPTOWN

388
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,926
AND YOU'RE TOO EXHAUSTED FROM DATING THE ONE IN POUGHKEEPSIE

389
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,427
SO I SAY YOU END THEM BOTH.

390
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,430
TAKE A TRAIN UP TO POUGHKEEPSIE AND YOU BREAK UP WITH HER

391
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,432
AND, ON YOUR WAY BACK, YOU BREAK UP WITH UPTOWN

392
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,935
AND THEN, BY THE TIME YOU GET HOME TONIGHT

393
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,936
YOU'RE DONE.

394
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,938
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.

395
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,439
THANK YOU.

396
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,943
YEAH. I HAD A SIMILAR PROBLEM WHEN I LIVED IN PRAGUE.

397
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,945
PRAGUE?

398
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,948
SO MUCH YOU DON'T KNOW.

399
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,959

400
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,960

401
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,962
CHANDLER

402
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,965
PATRICK JUST ENDED THINGS WITH ME.

403
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,967
DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT TELL HIM

404
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,470
THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP?

405
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,472
I DID! I ABSOLUTELY DID!

406
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,474
YOU IDIOT!

407
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,977
I'M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT WHY?

408
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,478
YOU DON'T TELL A GUY

409
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,981
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP.

410
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,983
YOU DON'T TELL THE GUY THAT!

411
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,484
NOW YOU SCARED HIM AWAY.

412
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,485
OH, MAN, I AM SORRY.

413
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,487
I AM SO, SO SORRY.

414
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,490
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO TALK TO PEOPLE.

415
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,993
I KNOW! I KNOW!

416
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,496
NOW I'M RIGHT BACK WHERE I STARTED.

417
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,998
OH, THIS SUCKS.

418
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,500
BEING ALONE SUCKS!

419
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,501
YOU KNOW WHAT?

420
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,003
YOU'RE GOING TO MEET SOMEBODY.

421
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,005
YOU'RE A GREAT CATCH.

422
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,507
WHEN I WAS TELLING ALL THOSE GUYS ABOUT YOU

423
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,509
I DIDN'T HAVE TO LIE ONCE.

424
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,012
REALLY?

425
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,513
YEAH.

426
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:58,017
YOU GRADUATED MAGNA CUM LAUDE, RIGHT?

427
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,518
NO.

428
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,520
AW, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

429
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,024
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

430
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,526
I GOT TWO TICKETS TO TONIGHT'S RANGER GAME.

431
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,028
YOU WANT TO COME WITH ME?

432
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,530
CUTE GUYS IN LITTLE SHORTS?

433
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,532
SURE.

434
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,534
WELL, ACTUALLY, IT'S A HOCKEY TEAM

435
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,536
SO IT'S ANGRY CANADIANS WITH NO TEETH.

436
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,039
WELL, THAT SOUNDS FUN, TOO.

437
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,041
THANK YOU.

438
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,542
OKAY.

439
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,049
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN WITH A WOMAN?

440
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,051
WHAT?

441
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,553
CHANDLER, WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

442
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,557
SO THERE IS NO GOOD TIME TO ASK THAT QUESTION.

443
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,063
THE STATION IS POUGHKEEPSIE.

444
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,564
POUGHKEEPSIE.

445
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,068
ROSS?

446
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,070
ROSS?

447
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,571
WAKE UP.

448
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,073
ROSS?

449
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,575
ROS... ROSS!

450
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,078
ROSS! ROSS!

451
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,582
I NEED MORE SWORDFISH.

452
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,085
CAN YOU GET ME SOME MORE SWORDFISH?

453
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,587
I DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH.

454
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,589
YOU DID A MINUTE AGO.

455
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,591
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YA.

456
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,095
FINE.

457
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,606
OKAY, VERY FUNNY.

458
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,109
CAN SOMEBODY LET ME OUT, PLEASE?

459
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,611
COME ON, I'M COLD!

460
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,114

461
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,116
AND COVERED IN MARINARA SAUCE!

462
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,618
COME ON, LET ME OUT!

463
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,625
YOU FOUND THAT HANDLE, DID YA?

464
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,627
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

465
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,130
WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

466
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,134
I'M A GOOD PERSON

467
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,635
AND I'M A GOOD CHEF

468
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,138
AND I DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE MARINARA SAUCE ALL OVER ME.

469
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,641
IF YOU WANT ME TO QUIT THIS BAD

470
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,642
ALL YOU HAVE TO...

471
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,644
HEY! CHEF GELLER.

472
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,647
YOU KNOW THAT LITTLE SPEECH YOU MADE THE OTHER DAY?

473
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,650
WELL, I GOT A PROBLEM WITH IT.

474
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,153
YOU DO?

475
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,155
YOU BET I DO.

476
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,657
I JUST, UH...

477
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,659
WASN'T LISTENING THEN, IS ALL.

478
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,163
WELL, IF YOU WANT A PROBLEM

479
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,165
I'LL GIVE YOU A PROBLEM.

480
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,668
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, FIRE ME?

481
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,670
YOU BET YOUR ASS I'M GOING TO FIRE YOU.

482
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,172
NOW, GET OUT OF MY KITCHEN!

483
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,673
GET OUT!

484
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,179
ALL RIGHT

485
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,681
ANYBODY ELSE GOT A PROBLEM?

486
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,184
HOW ABOUT YOU, CHUCKLES?

487
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,186
YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY NOW?

488
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,187
NO.

489
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,189
HOW ABOUT IF I DANCE AROUND

490
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,191
ALL COVERED IN SAUCE, HUH?

491
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,193
YOU THINK IT'S FUNNY NOW?

492
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,695
NO. IT'S REALLY GOOD.

493
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,197
GOOD.

494
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,699
NOW, TAKE THOSE SALADS TO TABLE FOUR

495
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,701
AND YOU, GET THE SWORDFISH

496
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,702
AND YOU...

497
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,205
GET A HAIRCUT.

498
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,210
LAST STOP, MONTREAL.

499
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,712
THE STOP IS MONTREAL.

500
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,717
WHAT?

501
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,724
I MADE A BET WITH MYSELF THAT YOU HAD BEAUTIFUL EYES.

502
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,727
NOW THAT I SEE THEM, I WIN.

503
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,233
WHAT?

504
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,734
WE'RE AT MY STOP

505
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,736
BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE COFFEE?

506
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,742
ARE WE REALLY IN MONTREAL?

507
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,244
YES, WE ARE.

508
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,745
SO, COFFEE?

509
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,749
COFFEE SOUNDS GREAT.

510
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,755
WAIT. SO, YOU LIVE IN MONTREAL?

511
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,758
NO, BUT IT'S JUST A TWO HOUR FERRY RIDE TO NOVA SCOTIA.

512
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,765
WELL, I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT MY WIFE AND KIDS

513
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,268
BEFORE I TALKED BACK TO CHEF GELLER.

514
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,770
THANKS.

515
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,273
YEP, LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE A LEAN CHRISTMAS

516
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,275
AT THE DRAGON HOUSE THIS YEAR.

517
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,278
ENOUGH.

518
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,779
OKAY.

519
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,283
LEAN, LEAN, LEAN.

520
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,787
SO, THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL

521
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,789
HOLIDAY SONG THAT I WROTE

522
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,792

00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,813

00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,318

00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,833
?? AND PLEASE TELL JOEY ??
