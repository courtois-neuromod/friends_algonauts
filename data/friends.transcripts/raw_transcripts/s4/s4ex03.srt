1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,504
HEY! WE ARE SO IN LUCK.

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,505
TREEGER SAID WE COULD HAVE

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,008
ALL THIS COOL STUFF FROM THE BASEMENT.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,010
WAIT RIGHT THERE.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,011
OH, NO, NO.

6
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,512
I'M PADDLING AWAY.

7
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,016
HUH?

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,017
WOW. REALLY?

9
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,019
WE GOT ALL THIS RUSTY CRAP FOR FREE?

10
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,021
UH HUH.

11
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,523
THIS AND A BUNCH OF BUBBLE WRAP

12
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,525
AND SOME OF IT IS NOT EVEN POPPED.

13
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,529

14
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,535
COULD WE BE MORE WHITE TRASH?

27
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,087
HOW DESPERATE AM I?

28
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,589
OH, GOOD THING CHANDLER'S NOT HERE.

29
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,091
HE ALWAYS WINS AT THIS GAME.

30
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,593
I JUST TOLD MY MOM I'D CATER A PARTY FOR HER.

31
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,594
HOW COME?

32
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,596
BECAUSE I NEED THE MONEY

33
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,098
AND I THOUGHT IT'D BE A GREAT WAY

34
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,100
TO GET RID OF THAT LAST LITTLE SMIDGEN

35
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,601
OF SELF RESPECT.

36
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,103
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD THING.

37
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,105
I DON'T THINK MOM WOULDN'T HAVE HIRED YOU

38
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:45,605
IF SHE DIDN'T THINK

39
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,107
YOU WERE GOOD AT WHAT YOU DO.

40
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,110
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STICK UP FOR HER.

41
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,611
SHE CAN'T HEAR YOU.

42
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,613
HEY...

43
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,115
YOU GUYS HAVE ANY JUICE?

44
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,616
JUST PICKLE.

45
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,619
HEY, RACH, FUNNY STORY.

46
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,122
I BUMPED INTO JOANNA ON THE STREET YESTERDAY.

47
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,623
MY BOSS, JOANNA?

48
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,625
WOW, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN AWKWARD.

49
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,628
WELL, NO. SHE ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO GET A DRINK.

50
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,130

51
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,633
YOU, UH, DIDN'T SAY YES TO THAT, DID YOU?

52
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,135
NO.

53
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,636
NO.

54
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,637
HELLO, RACHEL.

55
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,144
WELL, NOT AT FIRST.

56
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,647
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

57
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,649

58
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,154
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

59
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,655
LAST TIME YOU WENT OUT WITH HER

60
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,656
YOU SAID SHE WAS A BIG, DULL DUD.

61
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,158
I JUDGED HER TOO QUICKLY.

62
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,161
THIS TIME WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE RELATIONSHIP

63
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,662
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

64
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,664

65
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,167
WELL, LAST TIME, I ALMOST GOT FIRED.

66
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,168
YOU MUST END IT.

67
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,669
YOU MUST END IT NOW.

68
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,172
IT'S NOT LIKE THIS IS AN EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE FOR ME.

69
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,674
USUALLY, I'M PRETTY MUCH IN THERE BY MYSELF.

70
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:59,179

71
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,181
CHANDLER!

72
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,682
PROMISE...

73
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,184
RACHEL, AREN'T YOU RUNNING LATE?

74
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,185
UH... NO.

75
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,186
YOU ARE IF YOU'RE

76
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,687
PICKING UP THE BAGELS.

77
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,189
OKAY.

78
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,192
CHANDLER, PROMISE YOU WILL END THIS NOW.

79
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,693
OKAY, I PROMISE.

80
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,694
I'LL END IT.

81
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,196
THANK YOU.

82
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,198
I HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GIVING UP FOR YOU

83
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,201
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT JUST THE BOSS IN YOUR OFFICE.

84
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,202
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

85
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,204
YEAH.

86
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:26,706
OH, SORRY.

87
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,708
I KNEW WHAT HE MEANT.

88
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,715
HOW'S THE HIRED HELP?

89
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,217
DOING GREAT.

90
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,718
QUICHES ARE COMING ALONG.

91
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,719
WHAT'S THIS?

92
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,720
BLUE NAIL POLISH?

93
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,723
YEAH. I THOUGHT IT WAS CUTE.

94
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,726
HA! THAT'S WHAT YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S HANDS LOOKED LIKE

95
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,228
WHEN WE FOUND HER.

96
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,233
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

97
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,734
WHY DID YOU HIRE ME?

98
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,735
OH, WELL, RICHARD RAVED

99
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,737
ABOUT THE FOOD AT HIS PARTY.

100
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,239
OF COURSE, YOU WERE SLEEPING WITH HIM.

101
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,741
THEN I HEARD THE FOOD AT THAT LESBIAN WEDDING

102
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,243
WAS VERY NICE.

103
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,246
I ASSUME YOU WEREN'T SLEEPING WITH ANYONE THERE--

104
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,747
THOUGH, AT LEAST

105
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,250
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING.

106
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,751
OH, MY GOD!

107
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,752
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

108
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,755
SHE HIRED ME BECAUSE SHE THINKS I'M GOOD.

109
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,759
OKAY. I DIDN'T HEAR THAT.

110
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,262
OH, YEAH. SHE DIDN'T HIRE ME OUT OF PITY.

111
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,264
IT WASN'T SO SHE COULD PICK ON ME

112
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,765
IN FRONT OF HER FRIENDS.

113
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,767
SHE ACTUALLY THINKS I'M GOOD.

114
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,768
WOW!

115
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,771
AND, HEY, IT'S COOL IF YOU'RE A LESBIAN.

116
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,283

117
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,787
GOOD AFTERNOON.

118
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,289
ARE YOU THE DECISION MAKER

119
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,790
OF THE HOUSE?

120
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,292
UH...

121
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,799
DO YOU CURRENTLY OWN A SET OF ENCYCLOPEDIAS?

122
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,801
NO, NO, BUT TRY THE CLASSIFIEDS.

123
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,803
PEOPLE SELL EVERYTHING IN THERE.

124
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,305
ACTUALLY, I'M NOT BUYING.

125
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,806
I'M SELLING.

126
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,808
LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION.

127
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,311
DO YOUR FRIENDS EVER HAVE A CONVERSATION

128
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,812
AND YOU JUST NOD ALONG

129
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,814
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE NOT REALLY SURE

130
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,816
WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT?

131
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,823
I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S TOTALLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

132
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,325
I TOTALLY AGREE.

133
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,326
YEAH.

134
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,830
I THINK HE DESERVES A NOBEL PRIZE.

135
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,832
NO! NO! WHAT?

136
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,337
I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE THE ALGON QUIN KID'S TABLE.

137
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,838

138
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,840

139
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,343
EXCUSE ME. I'M SORRY.

140
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,844
YOU HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING

141
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,845
FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES.

142
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,348
ARE YOU AT ALL INTERESTED?

143
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,849
YEAH, YEAH. YEAH, OH, YEAH.

144
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,351
COME ON IN.

145
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,854
THAT'S WEIRD.

146
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,855
WHAT?

147
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,357
YOUR NAILS.

148
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,358
I NEVER WEAR FAKE ONES.

149
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,860
I JUST DID IT SO MY MOM WOULDN'T GIVE ME GRIEF

150
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,362
ABOUT BITING THEM.

151
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,863
OH. NO, I MEANT IT'S WEIRD

152
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,865
THAT YOU ONLY HAVE NINE NOW.

153
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,870
OH, MY GOD.

154
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,871
WAIT A MINUTE.

155
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,873
I HAD IT WHEN I PUT...

156
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,876
OH, MY GOD, IT'S IN THE QUICHE!

157
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,878
OH, MY GOD!

158
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,879
OKAY, DON'T PANIC.

159
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,881
I'LL GET YOU ANOTHER SET OF NAILS.

160
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,384
NO ONE WILL KNOW, AND YOU'LL LOOK GREAT.

161
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,389
OH. OH, IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO EAT.

162
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,890
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

163
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,394
HONEY, DON'T BITE YOUR NAILS.

164
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:40,400
OKAY, UH, PLEASE DON'T FREAK OUT, UM, BUT, UH...

165
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,903
THERE'S A BLUE FINGERNAIL IN IN ONE OF THE QUICHE CUPS

166
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,905
AND THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW WHICH ONE.

167
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:52,412
AND WHOEVER FINDS IT WINS THE PRIZE.

168
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,913
I'M NOT FREAKING OUT.

169
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,415
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

170
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,418
IT'S JUST THAT NOW YOUR FATHER OWES ME FIVE DOLLARS.

171
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,420
WHAT? YOU BET I'D LOSE A NAIL?

172
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,422
OH, NO. DON'T BE SILLY.

173
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,424
I JUST BET THAT I'D NEED THESE.

174
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,426
FROZEN LASAGNAS?

175
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,429
YOU BET THAT I'D SCREW UP?

176
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,431
SO ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT HIRING ME

177
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,932
BECAUSE I WAS GOOD WAS...

178
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,434
NO. THAT WAS ALL TRUE.

179
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,936
THIS WAS JUST IN CASE YOU PULLED A MONICA.

180
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,940
YOU PROMISED DR. WEINBERG YOU'D NEVER USE THAT PHRASE.

181
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,442
OH, HONEY, COME ON.

182
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,943
HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR.

183
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,446
YOU'RE NEVER ABLE TO LAUGH AT YOURSELF.

184
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,447
THAT'S RIGHT.

185
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:28,948

186
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,950
MY MOM DOESN'T HAVE ANY FAITH IN ME.

187
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,951
THAT'S HILARIOUS!

188
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,953

189
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,955
I DON'T GET IT.

190
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,958
NO, I HAVE FAITH.

191
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,960
NO, YOU HAVE LASAGNAS.

192
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,967

193
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,470
OH, THE RUINED QUICHES ARE READY!

194
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,980
I REALLY DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS.

195
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,982
OKAY.

196
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,988
IT JUST DOESN'T FEEL LIKE WE'RE BREAKING UP.

197
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,990
NO, WE ARE.

198
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,992
I'M SAD.

199
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,994
OKAY.

200
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,996

201
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,500
YES?

202
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,502
CAN YOU WAIT TILL TOMORROW?

203
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,503
ALL RIGHT.

204
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,006
UNBELIEVABLE!

205
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,008
THANKS.

206
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,511
NO. THAT WAS MY BOSS.

207
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,512
I HAVE TO GO.

208
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,013
OKAY.

209
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,515
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

210
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,516
I'M GETTING DRESSED.

211
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,517
WHY?

212
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,519
WHEN I WALK OUTSIDE NAKED

213
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,521
PEOPLE THROW GARBAGE AT ME.

214
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,522
WAIT.

215
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,524
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

216
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,526
WHAT IS IT?

217
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,028
JUST A LITTLE GAG GIFT SOMEBODY GAVE ME.

218
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,030
PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER.

219
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,532

220
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,034
YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME.

221
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,038
YEAH, YOU ARE.

222
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,041
HMM...

223
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,543
SAUCY.

224
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,049
I'LL BE BACK IN TWO MINUTES.

225
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,051
YOU'RE, UH...

226
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,554
YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE ME LIKE THIS?

227
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,556
KNOWING YOU'RE HERE, WAITING FOR ME

228
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,559
I THINK THAT'S KIND OF EXCITING, DON'T YOU?

229
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,061
OKAY, BUT IF YOU DON'T COME BACK SOON...

230
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,064
THERE'S PRETTY MUCH NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

231
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,568
OH.

232
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,570
HI. I BROUGHT YOU BACK A MACAROON.

233
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,572
GREAT. I'LL KEEP IT IN MY BUTT

234
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,073
WITH YOUR NOSE.

235
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,581
THAT'S WEIRD.

236
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,582
SHE LOCKED THE DOOR.

237
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,083
YOU KNOW WHY?

238
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,085
SHE'S GOT THE CHRISTMAS BONUS LIST IN THERE.

239
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,087
I SAW HER WORKING ON IT THIS MORNING.

240
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,090
OKAY. SWEAR YOU WON'T TELL, BUT WHEN MARK LEFT

241
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,593
HE GAVE ME A KEY TO JOANNA'S OFFICE.

242
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,595
YOU WANT TO SEE THE LIST?

243
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,096
YEAH!

244
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,601

245
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,107
HI.

246
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,611
HOW ARE YOU?

247
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,119

248
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,622

249
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,626

250
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,629

251
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,131

252
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,633
HELLO. JOANNA'S

253
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,639
OFFICE.

254
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,140
 I'm really sorry

255
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,643
but I may be a little while longer.

256
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,144
HOW LITTLE?

257
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,646
A couple of hours. I feel awful.

258
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,647
LOOK, THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

259
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,148
YOU GET BACK HERE RIGHT NOW.

260
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,149
I can't.

261
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,150
WHY NOT?

262
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,652
I'm in my boss's car.

263
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,653
WHAT?!

264
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,154
Uh-oh. Tunnel.

265
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,165

266
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,670

267
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,673
WHAT?

268
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,676
 Rachel, could I see you for a moment?

269
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,684
OKAY, HERE'S THE SITUATION--

270
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,187
THE KEYS TO THE CUFFS ARE ON THE BACK OF THE DOOR.

271
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,189
COULD YOU BE A DOLL AND GRAB THEM

272
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,692
AND SCOOT ON OVER HERE AND UNLOCK ME?

273
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,696
AND, ON A TOTALLY SEPARATE SUBJECT

274
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,698
THAT IS A LOVELY PANTSUIT.

275
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,703
YOU PROMISED YOU WOULD BREAK UP WITH HER.

276
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,705
I DID BREAK UP WITH HER.

277
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,207
SHE JUST TOOK IT REALLY, REALLY WELL.

278
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:52,712
AND THE FACT THAT YOU WERE JEOPARDIZING MY CAREER

279
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,213
NEVER ENTERED YOUR MIND?

280
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,214
IT DID ENTER MY MIND

281
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,717
BUT THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT MADE IT

282
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,719
SHOOT RIGHT OUT.

283
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,220
YOU KNOW WHAT, CHANDLER?

284
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,222
YOU GOT YOURSELF INTO THOSE CUFFS

285
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,224
YOU GET YOURSELF OUT OF THEM.

286
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,726
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

287
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,228
I CAN'T GET MYSELF RIGHT OUT OF THEM.

288
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,231
YOU MUST HAVE ME CONFUSED

289
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,733
WITH THE AMAZING CHANDLER.

290
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,234
COME ON! YOU HAVE TO UNLOCK ME.

291
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,237
SHE COULD BE GONE FOR HOURS AND I'M COLD AND...

292
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,741
OH, CHANDLER!

293
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,242
ALL RIGHT. THIS IS IT.

294
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,244
YOU NEVER SEE JOANNA AGAIN.

295
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,245
YOU NEVER COME NEVER.

296
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,247
INTO THIS OFFICE AGAIN.

297
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,749
FINE.

298
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,250
YOU GIVE ME BACK MY WALKMAN.

299
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,252
I...

300
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,755
I NEVER BORROWED YOUR WALKMAN.

301
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,256
WELL, THEN I LOST IT.

302
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,257
YOU BUY ME ONE.

303
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,259
YOU GOT IT. HERE WE GO.

304
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,761
COME ON. THIS IS GREAT.

305
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,764
AH...!

306
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,265
DOES IT HURT?

307
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,267
NO. I JUST ALWAYS SEE GUYS DOING THIS

308
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,770
WHEN THEY GET HANDCUFFS TAKEN OFF THEM.

309
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,273
HELLO, SWEET PANTS.

310
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,275
WAIT A MINUTE.

311
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,277
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TELL JOANNA?

312
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,779
ABOUT WHAT?

313
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,280
WHEN SHE SEES THAT YOU'RE GONE

314
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,782
SHE'S GOING TO KNOW THAT I LET YOU OUT

315
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,283
AND THAT I WAS IN HERE AND I'LL GET FIRED.

316
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,786
I'LL MAKE SOMETHING UP. I'M GOOD AT LYING.

317
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,788
I ACTUALLY DID BORROW YOUR WALKMAN.

318
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,289
THERE'S NOTHING TO MAKE UP.

319
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,792
SHE'LL KNOW I HAVE A KEY TO HER OFFICE.

320
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,293
I'VE GOT TO GET YOU LOCKED BACK.

321
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,796
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

322
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,799
NAH, NAH, NAH, NAH, NO...

323
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,800
NO, NO, NO!

324
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,801
NO!

325
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,802
NO!

326
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,304

327
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,809
WELL, THIS IS MUCH BETTER.

328
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,314
SO, HERE'S SOMEBODY INTERESTING, JOEY.

329
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,316
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT VAN GOGH?

330
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,318
UH... HE CUT OFF HIS EAR.

331
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,820
AND?

332
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,821
I'M OUT.

333
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,824
HE PAINTED THAT.

334
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,826
WOW, THAT'S PRETTY NICE.

335
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,829
I THOUGHT HE CUT OFF HIS EAR BECAUSE HE SUCKED.

336
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,331
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT IN THERE?

337
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,333
LET'S SEE. UH...

338
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,835
WHERE DOES THE POPE LIVE?

339
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,836
IN THE WOODS.

340
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,838
NO, WAIT.

341
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,841
WAIT. THAT'S THE JOKE ANSWER.

342
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,343
ACTUALLY, IT'S VATICAN CITY.

343
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,845
NOW, UH...

344
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,347
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT VULCANIZED RUBBER?

345
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,350
SPOCK'S BIRTH CONTROL.

346
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,854
YOU NEED THESE BOOKS.

347
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,858

348
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,359
HEY.

349
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,861
HI.

350
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,863
THIS USED TO BE YOUR ROOM?

351
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,364
WOW, YOU MUST HAVE BEEN

352
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,867
IN REALLY GOOD SHAPE AS A KID.

353
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,869
OH, I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.

354
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:35,374
I CAN'T BELIEVE I ACTUALLY THOUGHT SHE COULD CHANGE.

355
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,878
LOOK, WHO CARES WHAT YOUR MOM THINKS?

356
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,380
SO YOU PULLED A MONICA.

357
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,882
OH, GOOD.

358
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,383
I'M GLAD THAT'S CATCHING ON.

359
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,886
WHY DOES THAT HAVE TO BE A BAD THING?

360
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,387
JUST CHANGE WHAT IT MEANS.

361
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,389
GO DOWN THERE AND PROVE YOUR MOTHER WRONG.

362
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,892
YOU FINISH THE JOB YOU WERE HIRED TO DO.

363
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,894
WE'LL CALL THAT "PULLING A MONICA."

364
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,395
WHAT?

365
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,898
OKAY, UM... IF A KID GETS STRAIGHT A's

366
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,401
HIS PARENTS WOULD SAY, "YEAH! YOU PULLED A MONICA."

367
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,907
OR A FIREMAN SAVES A BABY, AND THEY GO, "YEAH, I KNOW.

368
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,909
HE PULLED A MONICA."

369
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,410
OR SOMEONE HITS A HOME RUN

370
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,413
AND THE ANNOUNCER SAYS, "YEAH, THAT ONE'S OUT OF HERE."

371
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,915
BECAUSE SOME THINGS DON'T CHANGE.

372
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,417
ALL RIGHT. I'LL GO DOWN THERE

373
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,920
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SERVE THE LASAGNA.

374
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,923
I'M GOING TO SERVE SOMETHING THAT I MAKE.

375
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,929
OOH.

376
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,931
OH, WOW!

377
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,433
OH, MY BREASTS ARE REALLY STRONG.

378
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,939

379
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,441
OH, CHANDLER... CHANDLER, PLEASE.

380
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,444
I HAVE TO GET YOU LOCKED UP BACK THE WAY YOU WERE.

381
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,446
I AM SO GOING TO LOSE MY JOB.

382
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,449
SHE'S VERY PRIVATE ABOUT HER OFFICE.

383
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,451
NOW I KNOW WHY.

384
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,453
LOOK, YOU WERE IN TROUBLE EITHER WAY, OKAY?

385
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,957
IF SHE COMES IN, SEES ME LOCKED TO THIS INSTEAD OF THE CHAIR

386
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,959
SHE'S GOING TO KNOW YOU WERE IN HERE.

387
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,960
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL

388
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,461
JUST LET ME GO.

389
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,964
WHAT IF I CLEAN YOUR BATHROOM FOR A MONTH?

390
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,465
IT STILL

391
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,466
WOULDN'T BE CLEAN.

392
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,469
ALL I WANT IS MY FREEDOM.

393
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,471
FOOT RUBS FOR A MONTH.

394
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,973
FREEDOM!

395
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,975
I'LL PUT ALL YOUR PHOTOS INTO ALBUMS.

396
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,476
FREEDOM! I WANT MY FREEDOM!

397
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,978
WHY WON'T YOU HEAR ME?

398
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,479
SOPHIE, HELP ME! HELP ME!

399
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,981
SOPHIE, SIT!

400
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:22,982
FREEDOM!

401
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,483

402
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,985
WILL YOU JUST CALM DOWN?

403
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,486

404
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,995
I'M GOING TO SAY THIS FOR THE LAST TIME.

405
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,998
WOULD YOU PLEASE JUST...?

406
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,505
WOW. THERE'S A LOT I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT VOMIT.

407
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,508

408
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,011
IN A MINUTE.

409
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,013
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY, JOEY?

410
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:58,017
YOU GET THE WHOLE SET OF ENCYCLOPEDIAS FOR $1,200 DOLLAR.

411
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,520
THAT WORKS OUT TO JUST 50 BUCKS A BOOK.

412
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,022
$1,200 DOLLAR?

413
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,526
YOU THINK I HAVE $1,200 DOLLAR?

414
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,528
I'M HOME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY

415
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,031
AND I GOT PATIO FURNITURE IN MY LIVING ROOM.

416
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,534
I GUESS THERE'S A FEW THINGS

417
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,036
YOU DON'T GET FROM BOOK LEARNING.

418
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,039
WELL, UH... WHAT CAN YOU SWING?

419
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,540
HOW ABOUT ZERO DOWN

420
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,543
AND ZERO A MONTH FOR A LONG, LONG TIME?

421
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,047
YOU DON'T HAVE... ANYTHING?

422
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,049
YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT I GOT?

423
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,051
OKAY. I GOT...

424
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,053
A BABY TOOTSIE ROLL

425
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,556
A MOVIE STUB, KEYS, A KLEENEX...

426
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,560
A ROCK...

427
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,562
AND AN ARMY MAN. MAN...

428
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,065
OKAY, I... I GET THE PICTURE.

429
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,067
UH... THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.

430
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,568
AND A 50.

431
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,070
HUH.

432
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,072
THESE MUST BE CHANDLER'S PANTS.

433
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,075
FOR 50 BUCKS, YOU CAN GET ONE BOOK.

434
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,077
WHAT WILL IT BE-- "A," "B," "C"?

435
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,579
I THINK I'M GOING TO STICK WITH THE "V."

436
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,082
I WANT TO SEE HOW THIS BAD BOY TURNS OUT.

437
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,087
 I, UH...

438
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,590
WILL BUY AND WRAP ALL OF YOUR CHRISTMAS GIFTS.

439
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,092
NO!

440
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,095
I, UH... I'LL SQUEEZE YOU FRESH ORANGE JUICE EVERY MORNING.

441
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,596
WITH EXTRA PULP?

442
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,097
YEAH!

443
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,098
NO!

444
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,599

445
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,103
I'VE GOT IT.

446
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,106
YOU DON'T HAVE IT.

447
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,607
I HAVE SO GOT IT.

448
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,110
THERE'S GOING TO BE RUMORS ABOUT THIS.

449
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,611
THERE'S NO WAY TO STOP IT.

450
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,114
SOPHIE KNOWS. MONICA AND PHOEBE KNOW.

451
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,615
HOW DO MONICA AND PHOEBE KNOW?

452
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,617
OH, I CALLED THEM.

453
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,620
AND WHEN THEY ASK ME WHAT I SAW

454
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,623
I CAN BE VERY GENEROUS...

455
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,127
OR VERY STINGY.

456
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,630
GO ON.

457
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,133
I CAN MAKE YOU A LEGEND.

458
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,637
I CAN MAKE YOU THIS GENERATION'S MILTON BERLE.

459
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,639
AND MILTON BERLE HAS...?

460
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,142
AW, NOT COMPARED TO YOU.

461
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,646
WELL?

462
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,648
THEY'RE NOT EVEN TOUCHING THE LASAGNA.

463
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,650
REALLY? BUT THEY LOVE YOUR CASSEROLE.

464
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,152
YES!

465
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,655
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO

466
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,157
THIS WAS NOTHING BUT INGREDIENTS.

467
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,659
EVERYONE SEEMS TO LIKE YOUR DISH.

468
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,661
AND YOU?

469
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,165
I THOUGHT IT WAS...

470
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,167
QUITE TASTY.

471
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,669
SO IF EVERYONE LIKED IT

472
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,171
AND YOU LIKED IT

473
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,173
THAT WOULD MAKE THIS A SUCCESS.

474
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,674
WHICH WOULD MAKE YOU...

475
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,176
A BITCH?

476
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,178
WELL, I WAS GOING FOR "WRONG"

477
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,180
BUT WE CAN USE YOUR WORD.

478
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,184
YES, WELL, I WAS WRONG

479
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,186
AND I HAVE TO SAY...

480
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,689
YOU REALLY IMPRESSED ME TODAY.

481
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,692
WOW.

482
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:57,696
YOU MIGHT EVEN SAY THAT SHE PULLED A MONICA.

483
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,700
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WE SWITCHED IT.

484
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,704
AND THE NEXT TIME YOU CATER FOR ME

485
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,708
THERE'LL BE NOTHING BUT ICE IN THE FREEZER.

486
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,211
THAT REALLY MEANS A LOT.

487
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,713
OY, MOM,  DON'T BITE YOUR NAILS.

488
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,221
HELLO.

489
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,722
HEY. HEY. HEY.

490
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,225
HELLO, CHANDLER.

491
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,727
I LOVE YOU.

492
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,730
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

493
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:32,731
OH...

494
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,233

495
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,237
NO, HE DOESN'T.

496
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,738

497
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,241
TWO HOURS, THAT LASTED.

498
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,744
SO DID YOU BREAK UP WITH JOANNA?

499
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,246
I THINK SO.

500
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,248
IT'S A GOOD THING YOU GOT OUT WHEN YOU DID

501
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,750
BEFORE SHE BLEW UP LIKE THAT VESUVIUS.

502
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,253
THE VOLCANO?

503
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,255
YEAH. AND SPEAKING OF VOLCANOES

504
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,258
MAN, ARE THEY A VIOLENT, IGNEOUS ROCK FORMATION.

505
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,260
WHAT?

506
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,263
OH, YEAH-- LAVA SPEWING, HOT ASH...

507
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,265
OF COURSE, SOME ARE DORMANT.

508
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,267
WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT VOLCANOES

509
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,768
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

510
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,270
WE CAN TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

511
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,272
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT? VIVISECTION?

512
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,773
THE VAS...

513
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,276
DEFERENS?

514
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,278
THE VIETNAM WAR?

515
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,280
OH, DID ANYBODY SEE THAT DOCUMENTARY

516
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,781
ON THE KOREAN WAR?

517
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,284
 OH, YEAH.

518
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,785
KOREA IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY.

519
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,787
WITH SUCH A SAD HISTORY.

520
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,789
YEAH.

521
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,790
COULD THERE BE MORE KIMS?

522
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,294

523
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,801
 WHO'S OUT THERE?

524
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,802
IT'S ME. GOOD MORNING.

525
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,805
RACHEL, COULD YOU COME IN HERE FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?

526
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,308
YEAH, SURE. UM, THEY DIDN'T HAVE POPPYSEED BAGELS

527
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,810
SO I... OH, MY WORD!

528
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:56,815
HI. I SEEM TO HAVE HAD A SLIGHT OFFICE MISHAP.

529
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,317
COULD YOU PLEASE GET THE KEY

530
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,319
OFF THE BACK OF THE DOOR FOR ME?

531
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,321
YEAH. OF COURSE. UM...

532
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,830
IF YOU COULD...

533
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,332
OH, I'M SORRY!

534
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,836
YOU CAN TELL YOUR FRIEND CHANDLER

535
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,339
THAT WE'RE DEFINITELY BROKEN UP THIS TIME.
