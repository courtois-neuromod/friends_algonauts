1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,004
I CAN'T BELIEVE

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,505
MY LITTLE BROTHER IS MARRIED.

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,506
I KNOW.

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,008

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,010
YOU GUYS, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,011
YOU WERE ELOPING?

7
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,512
WE WERE AT THE COURTHOUSE.

8
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,014
WE WERE HAVING LUNCH...

9
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,016
WAIT. WHY WERE YOU AT THE COURTHOUSE?

10
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,517
WE WERE HAVING LUNCH.

11
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,520
YEAH, AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE WERE, LIKE

12
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,022
"HEY, YOU KNOW, WE'RE HERE.

13
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,023
"WE'RE HAVING LUNCH.

14
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,025
LET'S GET MARRIED!" RIGHT?

15
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,526
WOW. A YEAR AND A HALF AGO

16
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,028
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I HAD A BROTHER.

17
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,529
NOW I HAVE A SISTER, TOO.

18
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,531

19
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,534
OH, IT'S SO GREAT. OH...

20
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,536

21
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,538
OKAY.

22
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,540
OKAY.

23
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,043
STOP IT. DON'T.

24
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,544
OH.

25
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,546
SO, OOH, I'M GOING TO GET YOU A GIFT NOW.

26
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,049
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU NEED?

27
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,550
UH... YEAH.

28
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,552
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET PREGNANT

29
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,054
UH, PRETTY MUCH EVER SINCE

30
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,055
WE GOT ENGAGED.

31
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,557
THOUGHT WE'D GET A JUMP ON THINGS.

32
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,559
YOU KNOW, NO ONE'S GETTING ANY YOUNGER.

33
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,561

34
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,562
BECAUSE THE THING IS

35
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,564
UM, WE'RE NOT ABLE TO, YOU KNOW

36
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,066
UH, CONCEIVE, YOU KNOW?

37
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,567
AND WE'VE TRIED EVERYTHING.

38
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,569
WE'VE SEEN A BUNCH OF DOCTORS.

39
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,571
YEAH, AND THEY... THEY SAY THAT...

40
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,573
THAT OUR ONLY CHANCE TO HAVE A BABY

41
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,075
IS IF THEY TAKE MY SPERM

42
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,577
HER EGG, AND PUT IT TOGETHER IN A DISH

43
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,579
AND THEN PUT IT INTO ANOTHER GIRL.

44
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,081
SO WE WERE WONDERING

45
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,084
IF YOU COULD BE THE GIRL THAT WE COULD PUT IT INTO.

46
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,090
THAT'S A REALLY NICE GIFT.

47
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,595
I WAS THINKING OF, LIKE, A GRAVY BOAT.

48
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,597
WE KNOW... WE KNOW IT'S A LOT TO ASK.

49
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,100
WE DON'T HAVE ANYONE ELSE TO GO TO.

50
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,601
WE COULD PAY SOMEONE TO DO IT

51
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,104
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY.

52
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,605
PLUS, YOU KNOW , YOU'RE FAMILY.

53
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,107
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

54
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,109
I JUST DON'T WANT MY BABY TO GROW

55
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,111
INTO SOME CHICK I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW?

56
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,114
DON'T GIVE US AN ANSWER YET.

57
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,116
THINK ABOUT IT.

58
00:01:56,116 --> 00:02:00,620
AND, IF YOU SAY NO, WE WILL TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

59
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,623
OKAY. OKAY.

60
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,127
OH, AND ALSO, WE WERE WONDERING

61
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,628
IF YOU COULD GIVE US A RIDE

62
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,629
DOWN TO THE TRAIN STATION.

63
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,634
WELL, ACTUALLY, WE KIND OF NEED AN ANSWER

64
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,136
TO THAT ONE RIGHT NOW.

77
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,186
HEY! YOU GUYS.

78
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,188
CHECK IT OUT, CHECK IT OUT.

79
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,689
GUESS WHAT JOB I JUST GOT.

80
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:16,696
I DON'T KNOW, BUT DONALD TRUMP WANTS HIS BLUE BLAZER BLACK.

81
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,198
WHAT?

82
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,200
BLUE BLAZER BACK.

83
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,203
HE HE WANTS IT BACK.

84
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,704
WELL, Y YOU SAID "BLACK."

85
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,207
WHY WOULD HE WANT HIS BLUE BLAZER BLACK?

86
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,710
WELL, YOU YOU KNOW WHAT I MEANT.

87
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,212
NO. YOU MESSED IT UP.

88
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,715
YOU'RE STUPID.

89
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,220
SO, WHAT JOB DID YOU GET, JOE?

90
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,222
OH. UH, TOUR GUIDE AT THE MUSEUM.

91
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,723
YEAH. ROSS GOT IT FOR ME.

92
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,726
DON'T YOU HAVE TO BE A DINOSAUR EXPERT OR SOMETHING?

93
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,727
NO, NOT REALLY.

94
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,729
THEY GIVE YOU ALL THE INFORMATION.

95
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,232
IT'S, UH, IT'S LIKE MEMORIZING A SCRIPT. YEAH.

96
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,734
"AND, ON YOUR LEFT, YOU HAVE TYRANNOSAURUS REX

97
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,736
A CARNIVORE FROM THE JURASSIC PERIOD."

98
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,738

99
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,240
UH, ACTUALLY, JOEY

100
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,742
IT'S THE CRETACEOUS PERIOD.

101
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,247
YEAH, BUT I CAN PRONOUNCE "JURASSIC."

102
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,748
 HEY. HEY!

103
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,749
GUESS WHAT.

104
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,751
FRANK JR. AND ALICE GOT MARRIED.

105
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,753

106
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,255
AND THEY'RE HAVING A BABY.

107
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,257

108
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,760
AND, AND, THEY WANT ME TO GROW IT FOR THEM IN MY UTERUS.

109
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,265
OH, MY GOD.

110
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,266
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

111
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,767
YEAH.

112
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,269
YOU'RE REALLY THINKING

113
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,272
OF HAVING SEX WITH YOUR BROTHER?

114
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,276
EWW! AND, OH, NO!

115
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,778
IT'S... THEY WANT ME TO BE THE SURROGATE.

116
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,282
IT'S HER EGG AND HIS SPERM, AND I'M I'M JUST THE OVEN.

117
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,783
IT'S TOTALLY THEIR BUN.

118
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,784
OH.

119
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,286
WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM?

120
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,287
WELL, THEY SAID

121
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,788
I HAD TO THINK ABOUT IT FIRST

122
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,290
BUT WHAT IS THERE TO THINK OF?

123
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,292
I'M GOING TO BE GIVING SOMEONE

124
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,294
THE GREATEST GIFT YOU CAN POSSIBLY GIVE.

125
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,797
YOU'RE GOING TO CARRY THEIR CHILD AND GET THEM

126
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,299
A SONY PLAYSTATION?

127
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,802
HONEY, THIS REALLY IS AN INCREDIBLE THING TO DO FOR THEM

128
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,804
BUT THERE ARE THINGS TO THINK ABOUT.

129
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,307
YEAH. I MEAN, YOU'D BE PREGNANT.

130
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,309
I MEAN, PREGNANT.

131
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,312
I KNOW.

132
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,813
PHEEBS, YOU'RE TALKING

133
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,815
ABOUT PUTTING YOUR BODY THROUGH AN AWFUL LOT.

134
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,319
I MEAN, MORNING SICKNESS, UH... LABOR

135
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,820
AND IT'S ALL FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

136
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,822
YEAH. WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

137
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,827
WELL, THE STUFF I JUST MENTIONED.

138
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,829
WOW. I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD EVER DO THAT.

139
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,832
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS FIGURED THE FIRST TIME I HAD A BABY

140
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,336
IT WOULD BE WITH SOMEONE I LOVE, AND THAT BABY WAS, YOU KNOW...

141
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,837
A KEEPER.

142
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,340
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS WERE A LOT MORE SUPPORTIVE

143
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,342
WHEN I WANTED TO MAKE DENIM FURNITURE.

144
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,844
PHEEBS, LISTEN, IF YOU DECIDE TO DO THIS

145
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,346
WE'LL BE SUPPORTIVE LIKE CRAZY.

146
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,347
YEAH. YEAH.

147
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,848
JUST THINK IT THROUGH.

148
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,850
TALK TO SOMEBODY WHO'S HAD A BABY.

149
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,352
LIKE YOUR MOM.

150
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,853
MY MOM NEVER GAVE BIRTH.

151
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,357
OH, BUT MY BIRTH MOM DID.

152
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,865
MMM, I LOVE THIS TUSHIE.

153
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,367
CAN I TAKE IT TO WORK WITH ME?

154
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,369
OH, YEAH, SURE. IT'S NOT MINE ANYWAY.

155
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,870
IT CAME WITH THE PANTS.

156
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,871
OH.

157
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,878
I AM SO SJEALOUS.

158
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,381
YOU GUYS ARE REALLY JUST RIGHT STHERE, AREN'T YOU?

159
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,383
YES.

160
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,385
RIGHT WHERE?

161
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:29,389
THE BEGINNING, WHERE... YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL SEX

162
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,393
AND TALKING AND SEX AND TALKING AND...

163
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,395
YEAH. YOU YOU GOT TO LOVE THE TALKING.

164
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:37,897
AND THE SEX?

165
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,399
WE HAVEN'T HAD SEX YET.

166
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,401
OKAY, BUT WHAT'S

167
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,902
THE BIG DEAL, YOU KNOW?

168
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,904
THIS IS SPECIAL, AND I WANT OUR LOVE TO GROW

169
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,906
BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

170
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,909
OH, CHANDLER, THAT IS SO NICE.

171
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,411
THAT IS REALLY NICE...

172
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,413
LYING.

173
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,416
NO WAY IS THAT THE REASON.

174
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,917
WHY?

175
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,920
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT MATURE ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND?

176
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,921
NO, HE'S RIGHT.

177
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,423
I'M TOTALLY LYING.

178
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,429
THEN WHAT IS IT?

179
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,931
WELL, KATHY'S LAST BOYFRIEND WAS JOEY.

180
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,934
AND YOU'RE AFRAID YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO...

181
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,937
"FILL HIS SHOES."

182
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,941
NO, I'M AFRAID I WON'T BE ABLE TO MAKE LOVE AS WELL AS HIM.

183
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,445
YEAH. I WAS GOING FOR THE METAPHOR.

184
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,447
YES, AND I WAS SAYING THE ACTUAL WORDS.

185
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,948
 WELL, BIG DEAL.

186
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,950
SO JOEY'S HAD A LOT OF GIRLFRIENDS.

187
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,952
THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE'S GREAT IN BED.

188
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,954
WE SHARE A WALL.

189
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,458
SO EITHER HE'S GREAT IN BED

190
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,461
OR SHE JUST LIKED TO AGREE WITH HIM A LOT.

191
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,466
LOUDLY AND A LOT.

192
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,468
ALL NIGHT LONG, SHE'D AGREE.

193
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,472
SWEETIE, WITH YOU, IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT.

194
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,973
THE SEX IS GOING TO BE GREAT

195
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,974
BECAUSE YOU YOU GUYS ARE IN LOVE.

196
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,476
YEAH?

197
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,477
 YEAH.

198
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:58,978
JUST GO FOR IT, CHANDLER.

199
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,480
YEAH. YOU SHOULD. YEAH.

200
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,483
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. I'LL SLEEP WITH MY GIRLFRIEND

201
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,486
BUT I'M JUST DOING IT FOR YOU GUYS.

202
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:15,995
OKAY. NOW, THE MASTODON IS FROM THE SEMI LATE JURASSIC PERIOD.

203
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,998
ISN'T THE MASTODON FROM THE PLIOCENE EPOCH?

204
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,501
SHH! THIS IS A MUSEUM.

205
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,002
NO TALKING.

206
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,006
OKAY. RIGHT DOWN HERE, WE HAVE...

207
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:31,010
A LARGE FOOT.

208
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,014
UH... AND, OVER HERE, WE HAVE ROSS GELLER.

209
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,016
EVERYONE WAVE HI TO ROSS.

210
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,019
ROSS IS ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT SCIENTISTS.

211
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,521
LOOK AT HIM HARD AT WORK.

212
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,528
OKAY. MOVING RIGHT ALONG.

213
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,029
COME ON.

214
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,533

215
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,034
IT'S OPEN. COME IN.

216
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,035
HI. HI.

217
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,537
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

218
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,538
OH, THAT'S OKAY.

219
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,541
IT GAVE ME TIME TO FINISH, UH, GLAZING MY NIPPLES.

220
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:06,045
WOW. YOU REALLY GO ALL OUT WHEN YOU'RE EXPECTING COMPANY.

221
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,548
NO, I WAS WORKING ON MY POTTERY.

222
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,552
OH.OH!OH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU DID...

223
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,554
POT.

224
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,056
WELL, YEAH, UH, MOSTLY NUDES.

225
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:21,060
IT COMBINES MY TWO PASSIONS: POTTERY AND EROTICA.

226
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,062
OH. OOH! "ERROTERY."

227
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,564
HEY! OKAY.

228
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,566
WELL, THANKS FOR COMING OUT TO SEE ME.

229
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,068
I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD IDEA

230
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,070
TO TALK ABOUT THIS BABY STUFF IN PERSON.

231
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,072
OKAY.

232
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,073

233
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,075
I DON'T THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA.

234
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,078
WHY NOT?

235
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,080
WELL, BECAUSE YOU'D BE GIVING UP A BABY

236
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,082
AND I I REALLY DON'T...

237
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,085
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I COULD SAY

238
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,588
THAT COULD MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND THE PAIN

239
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,089
OF GIVING UP A BABY, SO...

240
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,591
UM...

241
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,593

242
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,595
OH, NO, NO, NO. I UNDERSTAND THE PAIN.

243
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,598
DON'T DON'T HURT THE PUPPY.

244
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,100
NO, NO, NO. THE PUPPY IS YOURS.

245
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,101
OH, I GET A PUPPY?

246
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,603
WELL, YEAH.

247
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,104
I MEAN, BUT FOR ONLY THREE DAYS.

248
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,107
WHY?

249
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,108
WELL, YOU KNOW

250
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,110
I I REALIZE THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY RIGHT

251
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,113
TO START GETTING ALL PARENTY ON YOU AND EVERYTHING NOW

252
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,115
BUT, UM... UH...

253
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,120
PHOEBE, WOULD YOU PLEASE LOOK AT ME

254
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,121
AND NOT THE PUPPY?

255
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,623
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

256
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,124
OKAY.

257
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,126
I MEAN, I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

258
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,628
I GAVE UP TWO BABIES

259
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,130
AND I ONLY WISH THAT I HAD SOMEONE THERE

260
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,634
WHO HAD GIVEN UP BABIES THAT COULD HAVE TOLD ME

261
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,136
HOW TERRIBLE IT IS TO GIVE UP BABIES.

262
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,643
I REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN YOU THE PUPPY FIRST.

263
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,644
I'M SORRY.

264
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,145
THAT'S OKAY.

265
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,647
WE'RE LISTENING.

266
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,650
I JUST THINK THAT IT WOULD BE SOMETHING

267
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,152
THAT YOU WOULD REGRET EVERY SINGLE DAY

268
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,154
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

269
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,156
SO, HOWEVER HARD IT IS

270
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,158
FOR YOU TO GIVE UP THIS PUPPY

271
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,661
IT WOULD BE, LIKE, A MILLION TIMES HARDER

272
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,162
TO GIVE UP A CHILD.

273
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,165
OKAY. FAIR ENOUGH.

274
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,167
THREE DAYS.

275
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,169

276
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,172
OH, IT'S TIME TO TAKE MY ASS OUT OF THE KILN.

277
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,680
OH, UH, WOULD YOU MIND SITTING THERE?

278
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,182
I'M SAVING THIS SEAT FOR MY FRIEND ROSS.

279
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,684
YOU MEAN DR. GELLER?

280
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,187
"DOCTOR"? OH, I DIDN'T KNOW HE HAD A NICKNAME.

281
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,190
OH, HE WON'T SIT HERE.

282
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,693
ONLY THE PEOPLE IN THE WHITE COATS SIT OVER THERE

283
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,696
AND ONLY THE PEOPLE IN THE BLUE BLAZERS SIT OVER HERE.

284
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,698
WELL, UH, H HOW COME?

285
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,699
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.

286
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,201
THAT'S CRAZY.

287
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,704
MAYBE IT'S CRAZY IN A PERFECT WORLD--

288
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,206
A WORLD WITHOUT LAB COATS AND BLAZERS--

289
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,208
BUT YOU NOT IN A PERFECT WORLD.

290
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,210
YOU IN A MUSEUM NOW.

291
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,714
SEE THAT SCIENTIST WITH THE GLASSES?

292
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,216
HE AND I USED TO PLAY TOGETHER ALL THE TIME

293
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,217
IN GRADE SCHOOL.

294
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,219
HMM, BUT NOW...

295
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,721
PETER!

296
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,723
HEY, PETER!

297
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,225
IT'S ME, RHONDA

298
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,727
FROM P.S. 129!

299
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:11,230
I SHARED MY PUDDING WITH YOU, MAN.

300
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,735
I GAVE YOU MY SNACK PACK!

301
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:20,740
SEE? HE PRETEND HE DON'T EVEN HEAR ME!

302
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,742
I I THINK EVERYBODY'S PRETENDING

303
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,744
THEY DON'T HEAR YOU.

304
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,746
ANYWAY, LOOK.

305
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,748
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU AND YOUR JACKETS

306
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,249
AND YOUR SEPARATE TABLES

307
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,751
BUT ROSS IS ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS

308
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,252
AND IF I SAVE HIM A SEAT

309
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,254
I'M TELLING YOU, HE WILL SIT IN IT.

310
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,258
ROSS, ROSS, OVER HERE, MAN.

311
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,760
I SAVED YOU A SEAT.

312
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,763
THAT'S OKAY.

313
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,264
I'M COOL OVER HERE.

314
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,767
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER, JOEY.

315
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,773
OOP! THIS IS SAVED.

316
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,777
GIFT SHOP.

317
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,285
HEY, UH...

318
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,787
I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY

319
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,289
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CAFETERIA TODAY.

320
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,791
IT'S NO BIG DEAL, YOU KNOW.

321
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,793
YOU YOU DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO, RIGHT?

322
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,794
IT'S NOT JUST ME.

323
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,296
I MEAN, THE SCIENTISTS AND THE TOUR GUIDES

324
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,798
NEVER SIT TOGETHER.

325
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,300
WHATEVER.

326
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,802
IT'S LIKE THAT EVERYWHERE, JOEY.

327
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,303
OKAY, MON, BACK ME UP HERE.

328
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,805
WHERE YOU WORK

329
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,307
THE, UH, THE WAITERS EAT WITH THE WAITERS, RIGHT?

330
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,810
AND THE CHEFS EAT WITH THE OTHER CHEFS, RIGHT?

331
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,812
I EAT BY MYSELF IN THE ALLEY

332
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,313
BECAUSE EVERYBODY HATES ME.

333
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,817
OKAY, RACH, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

334
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,319
YOU HAD LUNCH WITH THE SHIPPING CLERKS?

335
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,822
OKAY, WELL, I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY EATEN LUNCH

336
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,323
WITH THE SHIPPING CLERKS

337
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,825
BUT IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

338
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,327
THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED IN THE EXECUTIVE CAFETERIA.

339
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,329
OH, I SEE... I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

340
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,332
LOOK, ROSS...

341
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,834
REALLY, IT'S IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

342
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,836
YOU KNOW, YOU WEAR A WHITE COAT.

343
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,337
I WEAR A BLUE BLAZER.

344
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,339
IF THAT MEANS WE CAN'T BE FRIENDS AT WORK

345
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,340
THEN SO BE IT, YOU KNOW.

346
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,842
AND I UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW?

347
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,843
WHEN I'M IN A PLAY

348
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,344
AND YOU'RE IN THE AUDIENCE

349
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,346
I DON'T TALK TO YOU, RIGHT?

350
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,351
SO, IT'S... YOU KNOW, IT'S, UH, IT'S IT'S COOL.

351
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,853
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

352
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,855

353
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,857
YEAH. WHEN WE'RE IN THE AUDIENCE

354
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,859
HE DOESN'T TALK TO US, BUT HE DOES WAVE.

355
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,367
WHO'S MY PUPPY? WHO'S MY PUPPY?

356
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,869
WHO'S MY PUPPY?

357
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,871
HAVE YOU NAMED HIM YET?

358
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,873
NO. I DON'T WANT TO GET ATTACHED.

359
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,876
CAN I HOLD HIM?

360
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,377
SURE. HERE.

361
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,879
COME HERE, SQUIRMY. HELLO.

362
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,382
NOT LIKE THAT! NO!

363
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,385

364
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,888
HI.

365
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,890

366
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,892
WHY'S PHOEBE SINGING TO KARL MALDEN?

367
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,895
OOH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

368
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,896
I THINK IT'S TIME

369
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,397
FOR PUPPY TO GO OUT AGAIN.

370
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,399
COME ON. LET'S GO TO THE BALCONY.

371
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,400
WHAT?

372
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,401
UH... THE STREET.

373
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,904
COME ON. LET'S GO TO THE STREET.

374
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,906
OH, LISTEN, DON'T GO ON THE BALCONY

375
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,407
UNTIL AFTER I GET BACK.

376
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:10,910

377
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,411
SO... DID YOU DO IT?

378
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,914
YES, YES, WE HAD THE SEX.

379
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,416
UH OH. IT WAS BAD?

380
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,419
IT WAS FINE, YOU KNOW, BUT SHE DIDN'T AGREE WITH ME

381
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,421
AS STRONGLY AS SHE AGREED WITH JOEY.

382
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,423
SHE WAS MORE, LIKE, UH

383
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,925
"OH, I SEE YOUR POINT.

384
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,927
 I'M ALL RIGHT WITH IT."

385
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,929
WELL, I MEAN, IT WAS THE FIRST TIME.

386
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,430
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOT ALWAYS

387
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,432
A LOT OF AGREEMENT THE FIRST TIME.

388
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,935
YEAH. NOT FOR GIRLS, ANYWAY.

389
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,937
GUYS AGREE... LIKE THAT.

390
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,939
LOOK, YOU HAVE TO HELP ME, OKAY?

391
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,942
I MEAN, I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH A WOMAN.

392
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,444
YOU KNOW, I KNOW WHERE EVERYTHING GOES.

393
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,447
IT'S ALWAYS... NICE, BUT I NEED TO KNOW

394
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,949
WHAT MAKES IT GO FROM NICE

395
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,451
TO "MY GOD, SOMEBODY'S KILLING HER IN THERE!"

396
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,453
ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING

397
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,955
A LOT OF GUYS DON'T KNOW.

398
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,456
RACH, HAND ME THAT PAD, PLEASE.

399
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,459
ALL RIGHT.

400
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,961
NOW...

401
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,462
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRAW

402
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,966
AN ACTUAL WO... WHOA, SHE'S HOT.

403
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,969
NOW, EVERYBODY KNOWS THE BASIC EROGENOUS ZONES.

404
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,971
YOU GOT ONE, TWO, THREE...

405
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:12,972
FOUR...

406
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,973
FIVE...

407
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,976
SIX AND SEVEN.

408
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,478
THERE ARE SEVEN?

409
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,981
LET ME SEE THAT.

410
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,983
OH, YEAH.

411
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,485
THAT'S ONE?

412
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,486

413
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,988
KIND OF AN IMPORTANT ONE.

414
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:29,989
OH, YOU KNOW...

415
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,491
YOU KNOW WHAT? I WAS LOOKING AT IT UPSIDE DOWN.

416
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,494

417
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,997
WELL, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THAT HELPS.

418
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,005
OKAY. NOW, MOST GUYS WILL HIT, UH, ONE, TWO, THREE

419
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,007
AND THEN GO TO SEVEN AND SET UP CAMP.

420
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,510
TH THAT'S BAD?

421
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,012
WELL, IF YOU GO TO DISNEYLAND

422
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,514
YOU DON'T SPEND THE WHOLE DAY ON THE MATTERHORN.

423
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,517
WELL, YOU MIGHT, IF IT WERE ANYTHING LIKE SEVEN.

424
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,519
 ALL RIGHT.

425
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,521
UH, THE IMPORTANT THING

426
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,522
IS TO TAKE YOUR TIME.

427
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,524
YOU WANT TO HIT THEM ALL

428
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,026
AND YOU WANT TO MIX THEM UP.

429
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,028
YOU GOT TO KEEP THEM ON THEIR TOES.

430
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,029
OH, TOES!

431
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,535
YEAH...

432
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,537
FOR SOME PEOPLE.

433
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,039
 ALL RIGHT.

434
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,040
YOU COULD, UH

435
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,043

456
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,577
 SEVEN.

457
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,084
AND THERE YOU ARE.

458
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,087
YEAH, THAT WILL WORK.

459
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,607
DR. GELLER, THERE'S A SEAT OVER HERE.

460
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,109
THANK YOU, DR. PHILLIPS...

461
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,612
BUT I'M HAVING MY LUNCH

462
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,116
AT THIS TABLE, HERE IN THE MIDDLE.

463
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,118
I'M HAVING MY LUNCH

464
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:43,122
RIGHT HERE WITH MY GOOD FRIEND JOEY...

465
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,124
IF HE'LL SIT WITH ME.

466
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,132
I WILL SIT WITH YOU, DR. GELLER.

467
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:03,142
YOU KNOW, WE WORK IN A MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

468
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,646
AND YET, THERE IS SOMETHING... UNNATURAL

469
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,649
ABOUT THE WAY WE EAT LUNCH.

470
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,151
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

471
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,153
IT TOOK A TOUR GUIDE

472
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:19,658
TO SHOW THIS SCIENTIST THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS.

473
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:25,664
YOU MIGHT EVEN SAY HE TOOK ME ON A TOUR OF MYSELF.

474
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,667
YEAH, THAT WAS... THAT WAS ME.

475
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,169
NOW...

476
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,172
I LOOK AROUND THIS CAFETERIA, AND YOU KNOW WHAT I SEE?

477
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,673
I SEE I SEE DIVISION--

478
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,676
DIVISION BETWEEN PEOPLE IN WHITE COATS

479
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,678
AND PEOPLE IN BLUE BLAZERS

480
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,181
AND I ASK MYSELF, "MY GOD, WHY?!"

481
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,187
NOW, I SAY WE SHED THESE THESE COATS

482
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,688
THAT SEPARATE US

483
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,692
AND WE GET TO KNOW THE PEOPLE UNDERNEATH.

484
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,197
I'M ROSS.

485
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,699
I'M DIVORCED, AND I HAVE A KID.

486
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,707
I'M JOEY.

487
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,209
I'M AN ACTOR.

488
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:14,713
I DON'T KNOW SQUAT ABOUT DINOSAURS.

489
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,218
I'M TED, AND I JUST MOVED HERE A MONTH AGO

490
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,220
AND NEW YORK REALLY SCARES ME.

491
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,721
ALL RIGHT. THERE YOU GO!

492
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,723
YEAH. YOU HANG IN THERE, TEDDY.

493
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,725
I'M ANDREW...

494
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,229
AND I DIDN'T PAY FOR THIS PEAR.

495
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,233
OKAY. GOOD GOOD FOR YOU.

496
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,235
I'M RHONDA...

497
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,238
AND THESE AREN'T REAL!

498
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,743
WOW, RHONDA.

499
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,744
UH...

500
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,247
I'M SCOTT...

501
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,249
YEAH. OKAY, SCOTT!

502
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,251
AND I NEED TO FLIP THE LIGHT SWITCH

503
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,753
ON AND OFF 17 TIMES BEFORE I LEAVE A ROOM

504
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,754
OR MY FAMILY WILL DIE.

505
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,262
MY MOM'S GOING TO BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

506
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,263
I CAN'T DO THIS.

507
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,764
I CAN'T GIVE HIM UP.

508
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,765

509
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,267
YES. NO, I CAN.

510
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,269
I DON'T WANT TO...

511
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,770
BUT I CAN.

512
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,773
NO.

513
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,275
OH, I CAN'T WATCH THIS.

514
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,277
IT'S LIKE SOPHIE'S CHOICE.

515
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,780
YOU KNOW, I NEVER SAW THAT.

516
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,782
OH, IT WAS ONLY OKAY.

517
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,284

518
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,285
I CAN'T DO THIS.

519
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,786
MY MOM WAS RIGHT.

520
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,289
IF I CAN'T... IF I CAN'T GIVE HIM UP

521
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,792
THEN... THERE'S NO WAY I CAN GIVE UP A LITTLE BABY.

522
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:38,297
OH, GOD, FRANK AND ALICE ARE GOING TO BE SO CRUSHED.

523
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,299
WH WHAT ELSE, WHAT ELSE CAN I GIVE THEM?

524
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,800
A KIDNEY.

525
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,803
HI.

526
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,804
 HI.

527
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,307
UM, WE WERE JUST IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, SO...

528
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,808
SO WE JUST THOUGHT WE'D STOP BY

529
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,810
AND LET YOU KNOW THERE'S STILL NO PRESSURE.

530
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,812
 NONE, BUT IF THERE WAS

531
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,314
SOMETHING YOU WANTED TO TELL US

532
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,317
WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE RIGHT OVER THERE HAVING COFFEE.

533
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,319
OKAY.

534
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,321
OH, WHO'S THIS LITTLE GUY?

535
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,822
OH. OH!

536
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,324
UM...

537
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,325
OH, HE'S SO CUTE.

538
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,827
HE REMINDS ME OF MY OLD DOG, TUMOR.

539
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,828
OH, OH.

540
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,830

541
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,334
YOU ARE SO PRECIOUS. I COULD JUST TAKE YOU HOME.

542
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,335

543
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,836
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU?

544
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,338
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

545
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,839
UH HUH. YEAH.

546
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,840
OH...

547
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,342
OH, THANKS.

548
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,344

549
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,845
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

550
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,847
NO. I'M REALLY OKAY WITH THIS.

551
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:29,848
YOU KNOW WHY?

552
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,350
BECAUSE LOOK AT THEM.

553
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,352
LOOK HOW HAPPY THEY ARE...

554
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:37,356
AND I MADE THAT, SO, YOU KNOW... I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE, LIKE

555
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,359
A MILLION TIMES HARDER TO GIVE UP A BABY

556
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,361
BUT, OH, MY GOD

557
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:46,365
IT'S GOING TO FEEL, LIKE, A MILLION TIMES BETTER, RIGHT?

558
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,867
I WANT TO DO THIS.

559
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,869
I WANT TO CARRY YOUR BABY.

560

00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,873
OH...

563
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,376
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

564
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,878
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS TO US.

565
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,380
OH...

566
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,383

00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,885
OH, MY GOD.

568
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,889
IT'S GOING TO BE SO GREAT.

569
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:11,890
UH HUH.

570
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,892
HI.

571
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,394
WHAT'S GOING ON?

572
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,396
OH! I I GAVE THEM THE PUPPY

573
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,399
AND IT MADE THEM SO HAPPY THAT I DECIDED I'M GOING

574
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,900
TO CARRY THEIR BABY.

575
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,901
UH, PHOEBE...

576
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,902

577
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,405
YOU AND I ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT PEOPLE, THOUGH

578
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,407
AND THIS IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SITUATION

579
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,909
AND I KNOW THAT I AM NOT GOING TO REGRET THIS.

580
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,912
OH, I I UNDERSTAND ALL THAT.

581
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,915

OH...

583
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,922
WOULD YOU EVER BE A SURROGATE FOR ANYONE?

584
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,924
IT DEPENDS WHO ASKED.

585
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,926
WHAT IF I ASKED?

586
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,428

589
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,931

590
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,936
YOU'RE NOT ASKING ME, ARE YOU?

591
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,438
NO.

592
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,440
