1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,005
O. HELL

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,506
HEY.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,012
WHOO HOO, CEREAL KILLER!

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,014
CEREAL KILLER?

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,516
COME ON, I SAY MORE DUMB THINGS BEFORE 9 A.M.

6
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,018
THAN MOST PEOPLE SAY ALL DAY.

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,021
UGH. WHAT?

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,024
NOTHING! I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING THAT I WANT TO EAT.

9
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,026
EVERYTHING MAKES ME NAUSEOUS.

10
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,028
BEING PREGNANT IS NO PIECE OF CAKE.

11
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,029
OOH, CAKE.

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,031
NO.

13
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,532
SEE?

14
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,534
OH, HONEY, I'M SORRY.

15
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,036
GOD... OOH!

16
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,537
WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

17
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,540
IT'S COMING FROM THE BATHROOM. OOH!

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,543
WOW, PREGNANCY DOES GIVE YOU SOME WEIRD CRAVINGS.

19
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,544

20
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:45,545
 YEAH?

21
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,047
IT'S ME, PHOEBE.

22
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,049
THERE'S SOMETHING IN HERE I WANT TO EAT.

23
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,050
WHAT, WHAT...?

24
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,552
WHAT SMELLS SO GOOD?

25
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,054
IS IT THE SHAMPOO?

26
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,555
IT'S GUAVA.

27
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,556
NO!

28
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,557
EWW!

29
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,059
OH, WAIT, WAIT!

30
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,062
IS IT MY BOLOGNA SANDWICH?

31
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,565
YES. YES, YES, YES!

32
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,068
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THE BABY WANTS BOLOGNA.

33
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,070
THE BABY WANTS ME TO EAT MEAT!

34
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,071
I CAN'T EAT MEAT!

35
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,572
OH, WAIT, WAIT!

36
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,076
MAYBE IT'S THE PICKLE.

49
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,127
WHAT ARE YOU WRITING?

50
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,129
WELL, JOSHUA'S COMING IN TOMORROW

51
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,631
AND SINCE I DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO ASK HIM OUT

52
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,133
I'M GOING TO SELL HIM A COAT

53
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,135
AND PUT THIS NOTE IN THE POCKET.

54
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,136
OH, YEAH?

55
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,139
"JOSHUA, GIVE ME A CALL SOMETIME.

56
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,640
"GUYS LIKE YOU...

57
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,643
NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE."

58
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,645
WHAT DID YOU THROW AWAY?

59
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,148
 HI, GUYS.

60
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,149
HI.

61
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,151
HEY, WHAT HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN UP TO?

62
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,154
OH, WE WENT TO SEE A COLLECTION OF VICTORIAN DOOR KNOBS

63
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,655
AT THE COOPER HEWITT MUSEUM.

64
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,157
WITHOUT ME?!

65
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,160
YEAH. MY UNCLE DRAGGED US THERE

66
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,662
BUT IT ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO BE REALLY INTERESTING.

67
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,664
THEY WERE SO ORNATE AND BEAUTIFUL.

68
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,665
I MEAN, LOOK AT THAT.

69
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,667
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUSEUMS WORK IN ENGLAND

70
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,169
BUT HERE, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED

71
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,670
TO TAKE STUFF.

72
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,672
I, UH, I GOT IT FROM THE GIFT SHOP.

73
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,175
THEY HAVE REALLY LAX SECURITY THERE.

74
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,678
IT'S A JOKE.

75
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,681
ANYONE FOR MORE TEA?

76
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,684
NO? JUST ME, THEN.

77
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,687
HEY, RINGO.

78
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,191
EVERY TIME EMILY'S AROUND, YOU TALK LIKE HER.

79
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,193
WOULD YOU PLEASE CUT IT OUT?

80
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,195
HO, HO, HO. I THINK YOU LIKE IT.

81
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,199
I THINK YOU CAN'T RESIST ME WHEN I DO IT.

82
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,202
YOU WANT TO EAT ME UP LIKE A CREAM PUMPET.

83
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,705
WHAT?

84
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,209
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I DON'T KNOW ALL THE WORDS.

85
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,711
ALL RIGHT.

86
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,213
RIGHT. I'VE GOT TO BE OFF.

87
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,215
WELL, SEE YOU. BYE BYE, THEN.

88
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,216
BYE BYE, THEN.

89
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,221
HEY, SO YOU GUYS SEEM TO BE HAVING A GOOD TIME, HUH?

90
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,722
OH, YEAH.

91
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,723
SHE'S SHE'S AMAZING

92
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,226
AND AND SHE'S SO MUCH FUN, YOU KNOW?

93
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,727
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

94
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,230
WHEN I'M WITH HER,I'MFUN.

95
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,231

96
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,235
I DO THINGS LIKE LIKE RUN OFF TO VERMONT AND...

97
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,237
YOU GUYS SAW THE DOORKNOB.

98
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,242
I EVEN SIGNED UP FOR HELICOPTER CLASSES.

99
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,745
SHE'S LEAVING IN TWO DAYS.

100
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,746
I DON'T HAVE TO DO IT.

101
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,747
WOW. TWO DAYS.

102
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,249
YOU MUST BE BUMMED.

103
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,251
YEAH. SHE'S GOT TO GO BACK TO LONDON

104
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,753
BUT I'VE BEEN PREPARED FOR THIS FROM THE START.

105
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,755
WE BOTH KNEW WE HAD TWO WEEKS TOGETHER

106
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,257
AND THEN THAT'S IT, YOU KNOW?

107
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,760
HEY, THAT'S WHAT ALL MY RELATIONSHIPS ARE LIKE.

108
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,262
YES, BUT IN ROSS'S CASE

109
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,264
THEY BOTH KNOW IN TWO WEEKS THAT'S IT.

110
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,267
PHEEBS!

111
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,268
HEY!

112
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,269
OH, HELLO! HELLO!

113
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,770
I KNOW, I KNOW. YEAH.

114
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,275
SO, THE BABY IS TOTALLY CRAVING MEAT.

115
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,277
THIS AFTERNOON, I TRIED TRICKING IT.

116
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,778
I MADE IT A SOY BURGER

117
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,281
SO MAYBE IT WOULD THINK IT WAS GETTING MEAT

118
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,282
AND I GOT NAUSEOUS.

119
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,285
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE SOY BURGERS SUCK.

120
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,289
BUT I'M NO OBSTETRICIAN.

121
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,792
BEING PREGNANT IS HARD ON YOUR TUMMY.

122
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,795
HEY, BUT AT LEAST YOU GOT THAT COOL, "PREGNANT LADY GLOW."

123
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,297
OH, THAT'S SWEAT.

124
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,299
YOU THROW UP ALL MORNING.

125
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,800
YOU'LL HAVE THAT GLOW, TOO.

126
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,308
OKAY.

127
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,810
OH, UH, HERE'S THAT TRENCH COAT THAT YOU WANTED.

128
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,312
OH, GREAT, GREAT.

129
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,813
WOW. YEAH.

130
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,315
IT'S COMFORTABLE.

131
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,816
YEAH. MAN...

132
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,319
I COULD REALLY FLASH SOMEBODY IN THIS THING.

133
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,820
OH, NO, NO. THEY DON'T WANT YOU

134
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,322
TO PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE POCKETS

135
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,324
UNTIL YOU ARE OUT OF THE STORE.

136
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,326
WHY NOT?

137
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,329
WELL, BECAUSE...

138
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,332
WE GET A LOT OF...

139
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,834
YOU KNOW, THEY RUIN IT FOR EVERYBODY.

140
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,336
I KNOW.

141
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,838
I WORE THAT CASHMERE SWEATER ON A DATE LAST NIGHT.

142
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,840
OH. YEAH.

143
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,343
IT WAS THE FIRST DATE SINCE THE DIVORCE.

144
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,345
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

145
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,347
SO, DO YOU LOVE HER?

146
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,848
NO, NO, NO.

147
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,850
SHE'S NICE, BUT IT JUST MADE ME REALIZE

148
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,853
I'M JUST NOT READY TO... TO BE DATING, YOU KNOW?

149
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,855
HUH.

150
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:56,856
WELL...

151
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,858
UH...

152
00:05:58,858 --> 00:05:59,859
THAT'S, UH...

153
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,860
THAT'S INTERESTING.

154
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,362
HEY, WHOA. HEY...

155
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,863
WHAT WAS THAT?

156
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,865
OH, IT'S JUST AN ANTI THEFT DEVICE.

157
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,368
THEN, UH, WH WHAT'S THIS?

158
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,370
WELL, YOU NEED THAT, YOU NEED THAT, TOO

159
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,873
BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY, A THIEF COULD JUST TEAR THIS RIGHT UP.

160
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,379
OH. LISTEN, WE HAVE TO HAVE A PARTY TONIGHT.

161
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,881
ACTUALLY, WE HAVE TO HAVE ONE IN FIVE MINUTES

162
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,383
SO EVERYBODY CANCEL YOUR PLANS.

163
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,385
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

164
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,388
WE HAVE TO HAVE A SURPRISE BON VOYAGE PARTY FOR EMILY

165
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,889
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY FOR JOSHUA.

166
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,391
THAT SUCKS.

167
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,394
NOBODY'S EVER THROWN ME A BON VOYAGE EMILY PARTY.

168
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,398
LOOK. HE SAID HE'S NOT READY TO DATE

169
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,899
SO I HAD TO INVITE HIM TO A PARTY

170
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,901
IF I WANTED TO SEE HIM OUTSIDE OF WORK

171
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,403
AND NOW I HAVE CREATED

172
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,906
THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO SEDUCE HIM.

173
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,409
WELL, AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO MEET JOSH

174
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,410
AND WARN HIM...

175
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,414
EMILY AND I AREN'T GOING TO BE HERE.

176
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,916
I MEAN, SHE'S GOING TO COME BY FIRST TO SAY GOOD BYE

177
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,919
AND THEN I'VE GOT A WHOLE SPECIAL EVENING PLANNED

178
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,920
SO, SORRY, NO PARTY.

179
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,922
AW!

180
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,424
HELLO.

181
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,426
SURPRISE!

182
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,929
SURPRISE! SURPRISE!

183
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,933
NO ONE'S EVER THROWN ME A SURPRISE PARTY BEFORE!

184
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,436
WELL, IT WAS ALL ROSS'S IDEA.

185
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,441
YOU'RE SO SWEET...

186
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,443
AND I'M SO SURPRISED.

187
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,948
YOU REALLY DIDN'T KNOW?

188
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,958

189
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,460
WHY ARE YOU OVER HERE

190
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,462
IF JOSHUA'S ALL THE WAY OVER THERE?

191
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,964
UH, BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO PLAY HARD TO GET.

192
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:45,965
HE'S LOOKING.

193
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,967
SAY SOMETHING FUNNY.

194
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,469
LIKE WHAT?

195
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,471

196
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,474
WH WH WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

197
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,477
I SAID "LIKE WHAT?"

198
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,482
WELL, THAT'S A THINKER.

199
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,983
OKAY. THIS PLAYING HARD TO GET THING

200
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,485
IS NOT WORKING.

201
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,486
HAND ME THOSE CHERRIES.

202
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,988
OKAY.

203
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,989
OKAY.

204
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,495
HI. HEY.

205
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,496
CARE FOR A CHERRY?

206
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,498
OH, NO, THANKS.

207
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,000
YOU KNOW, I CAN TIE ONE OF THESE INTO A KNOT

208
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,502
USING JUST MY TONGUE.

209
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,512

210
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,515

211
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,016
YOU OKAY?

212
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,518
YOU ALL RIGHT?

213
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,526
SO, WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET GOING SOON.

214
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,028
OH, BUT THE PARTY'S ONLY JUST GETTING STARTED.

215
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,531
WE HAVE TO BE AT THE FOUR SEASONS FOR DRINKS

216
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,033
IN-- OH!-- 15 MINUTES, AND THEN, UH, YOU KNOW

217
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,535
THEN THE PLAZA FOR DINNER.

218
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,037
SO, WHY DID YOU PLAN A PARTY AT THE SAME TIME?

219
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,040
NO, NO, NO. NO.

220
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,044
UM, ACTUALLY, AMERICAN SURPRISE PARTIES

221
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,046
ARE ARE ARE VERY SHORT.

222
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,548
IT'S USUALLY "SURPRISE!"

223
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,051
AND THEN, "OH, MY GOD, I'M SO SURPRISED. GOOD BYE."

224
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,555
ROSS, I'M HAVING SUCH A GREAT TIME.

225
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,557
YOUR SISTER HAS JUST BEEN TELLING ME

226
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,059
THAT YOU USED TO DRESS UP LIKE LITTLE OLD LADIES

227
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,061
AND HOST MAKE BELIEVE TEA PARTIES.

228
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,066
MONICA SAID THAT, DID SHE?

229
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,068
YEAH.

230
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,071
OH, OH, DID SHE TELL YOU THAT WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE

231
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,074
SHE WAS PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR NEW LEGISLATION

232
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:38,578
REGULATING THE STRENGTH OF SWING SETS?

233
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,085
OH, YEAH.

234
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,087
THEN WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO PUT ON TOP OF THAT?

235
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,589
A LITTLE SALAMI.

236
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,592
OOH, YEAH, YEAH.

237
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,595
THEN, UM, WHAT GOES ON TOP OF THE SALAMI?

238
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,096
OH, PASTRAMI.

239
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,598
OOH, YEAH.

240
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,101
YOU'RE A GENIUS.

241
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,607
OH, COULD SOMEBODY GIVE ME A HAND WITH THE ZIPPER?

242
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,608
YEAH.

243
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,611
UP!

244
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,615
YOU CHANGED?

245
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,117
YEAH. I DECIDED I NEEDED MY LUCKY DRESS.

246
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,119
AND "LUCKY" MEANS MORE CLEAVAGE?

247
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,622
IT DOES FOR ME.

248
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,632
OH, GOD, LOOK AT HIM!

249
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,633
HE'S SO CUTE!

250
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,134
I JUST WANT TO GO

251
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,136
OVER THERE AND GRAB HIM AND KISS HIM!

252
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,638
HOW COULD I KISS HIM

253
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,640
WITHOUT LETTING HIM KNOW THAT I LIKE HIM?!

254
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,642
OH, HEY, I KNOW HOW YOU CAN GET HIM.

255
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,643
TAKE OFF YOUR BRA.

256
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,645
WHAT?

257
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,146
THERE WAS THIS SCENE IN FOOT LOOSE...

258
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,648
FLAS HDANCE.

259
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,650
YEAH. WITH THAT PLUMBER GIRL...

260
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,651
SHE WAS A WELDER.

261
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,655
WERE YOU, LIKE, IN THE MOVIE, OR...?

262
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,661
ANYWAY, SHE TAKES OFF HER BRA UNDER THE SHIRT

263
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,663
AND PULLS IT OUT THE SLEEVE.

264
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,665
VERY SEXY, AND CLASSY.

265
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,670
OR, IF YOU WANT TO KISS HIM

266
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,171
UM, YOU COULD USE MISTLETOE.

267
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,673
IT'S NOT CHRISTMAS.

268
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,173
SPIN THE BOTTLE.

269
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,675
HE'S NOT 11.

270
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,179
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS.

271
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,181
IT WAS REALLY SO THOUGHTFUL OF YOU.

272
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,683
WHAT, YOU'RE LEAVING?!

273
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,685
YES. WE HAVE SOMETHING WE HAVE TO GET TO.

274
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,687
YEAH. I THINK I'M GOING TO TAKE OFF, TOO, ACTUALLY.

275
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,689
OH, YOU GUYS, YOU CAN'T LEAVE YET!

276
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,190
YOU HAVE TO STAY!

277
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,693
WE... WE'VE GOT THE WHOLE BIG THING PLANNED.

278
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,194
WHAT BIG THING?

279
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,697
SO, SPIN THE BOTTLE WORKS LIKE THIS:

280
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,198
I SPIN THE BOTTLE...

281
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,201
LANDS ON GUNTHER, SO I WOULD HAVE TO KISS GUNTHER.

282
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,705
ALL RIGHT.

283
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,207
WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST?

284
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,709
I'LL GO.

285
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,710
OKAY!

286
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,711
EMILY! WHOO!

287
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,215
WELCOME TO AMERICA.

288
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,221
ALL RIGHT.

289
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,224

290
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,726
TWO IN A ROW.

291
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,228
YOU GOT TO USE YOUR TONGUES NOW.

292
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,235
ALL RIGHT.

293
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,738
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

294
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,739
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

295
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,744
OKAY. TH THAT'S ENOUGH, YOU KNOW?

296
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,747
LET'S LET SOMEONE ELSE PLAY.

297
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,249
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY

298
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,751
THEN WHY'D YOU COME TO THE PARTY?

299
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,255
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO, I'LL GO.

300
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,258
SOMEBODY LOOSE. SOMEBODY LOOSE.

301
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,264
STORY OF MY LIFE.

302
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,767
GO AGAIN.

303
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,272
STORY OF MY FATHER'S LIFE.

304
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,775
OKAY. MY TURN!

305
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,277
OH!

306
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,279
LOOK AT THAT!

307
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,781
OH, MY GOD!

308
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,286
OH, MY GOD, THE BABY JUST KICKED!

309
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,788
OH!

310
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,789
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY!

311
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,791
IF IT KICKED ONCE, IT'LL KICK AGAIN!

312
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,792

313
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,295
ALL RIGHT.

314
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,799
WELL, EVERYBODY JUST REMEMBER WHERE THEY WERE SITTING.

315
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,809
IT WAS A BUG.

316
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,315
DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH I'M CRAVING IT.

317
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,317
YOU KNOW WHY I'M NEVER GOING TO EAT MEAT?

318
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,319
BECAUSE IT'S MURDER. IT'S COLD BLOODED MURDER.

319
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,821
OKAY.

320
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,328
THERE'S A PHOEBE ON MY SANDWICH.

321
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,332
PHOEBE, WH WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

322
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,834
I CAN'T HELP IT.

323
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,336
I NEED THE MEAT.

324
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,838
THE BABY NEEDS THE MEAT.

325
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,841
YOU KNOW HOW WHEN YOU'RE DATING SOMEONE

326
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,343
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO CHEAT ON THEM

327
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,846
UNLESS IT'S WITH SOMEONE REALLY HOT?

328
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,347
YEAH. TOTALLY.

329
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,849
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

330
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,851
WELL, THIS IS THE SAME KIND OF DEAL.

331
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,853
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING WRONG...

332
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,356
DO IT RIGHT.

333
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,360
 I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.

334
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,361
OKAY.

335
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,863
SHE...

336
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,866
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?

337
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,868
I MEAN, I'M TRYING  TO GET EMILY OUT OF HERE

338
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,870
AND YOU KEEP TALKING TO HER, BEING, OH

339
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,872
INTERESTING AND MAKING HER LAUGH.

340
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,374
FROM NOW ON, I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE FUNNY ANYMORE.

341
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,877
YOU KNOW WHAT? RACHEL WANTS ME TO BE FUNNY.

342
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,879
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO BE FUNNY.

343
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,381
FROM NOW ON, I'M GOING TO BE FUNNY SOMETIMES

344
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,883
AND NOT FUNNY OTHERS!

345
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,392
YOU FEEL BETTER NOW?

346
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,896
YEAH, BUT AT WHAT COST?

347
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,398
SIX MORE MONTHS, THREE MEALS A DAY.

348
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,400
I'M GOING TO EAT, LIKE, YOU KNOW...

349
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,402
MILLIONS OF COWS.

350
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,906
MOMMY COWS, DADDY COWS, BABY COWS...

351
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,408
NO. NO, I WILL NEVER EAT BABY COWS.

352
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,409
NO VEAL.

353
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,411
OH, BUT VEAL...

354
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,916
HEY, WHAT IF I SAID I COULD EVEN THINGS OUT FOR YOU...

355
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,917
MEAT WISE?

356
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,918
WHAT?

357
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,920
I EAT A LOT OF MEAT, RIGHT?

358
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,422
BUT SUPPOSE, UNTIL THE BABY'S BORN

359
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,423
I LAID OFF IT.

360
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,425
NO EXTRA ANIMALS WOULD DIE.

361
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,427
YOU'D JUST BE EATING MY ANIMALS.

362
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,931
JOEY, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME.

363
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,432
ABSOLUTELY.

364
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,935
I COULD BE A VEGETARIAN.

365
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,937
THERE'S NO MEAT IN BEER, RIGHT?

366
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,941
OKAY, WE CAN STILL MAKE DINNER IF WE SKIP APPETIZERS

367
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,442
AND ASK FOR OUR CHECK RIGHT AWAY.

368
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,948
WELL, WE CAN'T GO NOW.

369
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,952
LOOKS LIKE RACHEL'S GOING TO PUT ON A SKIT.

370
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,453
OH, MY GOD.

371
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,455
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

372
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,957
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

373
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,959
I AM FINALLY THINKING CLEARLY.

374
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,963
MY LUCKY DRESS WASN'T WORKING OUT TOO WELL FOR ME

375
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,466
BUT FOR FOUR YEARS, THIS BABY NEVER MISSED.

376
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,969
RACHEL, RACHEL, RACHEL, I CANNOT... I CAN'T LET...

377
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,971

OKAY, SO THAT'S ME AS A CHEERLEADER.

400
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,013

00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,015

402
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,016
FINE. I'M FINE.

403
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,017
I JUST LOOSENED A TOOTH.

404
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,019
IT'S NO BIG DEAL. I HAVE A DENTIST.

405
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,520
I'LL GO PUT SOME ICE ON IT.

406
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,521
EXCUSE ME.

407
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,025
OKAY. WHAT DO I DO NOW?

408
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,526
I THINK YOU'RE DONE.

409
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,530
OKAY. TIME TO TAKE OFF THE BRA.

410
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,531

411
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,536
UH, THAT WAS... REALLY, UH, GREAT

412
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,539
BUT I I GOT TO TAKE OFF, ACTUALLY.

413
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,042

414
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,046

00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,048
LET'S GO GET YOUR COAT.

416
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,049
OKAY.

417
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,053
RACHEL IS MY GIRLFRIEND.

418
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,558
SO, THIS WAS, UH, REALLY FUN.

419
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,560
OH, YEAH. IT'S REAL FUN.

420
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,068
YOU KNOW, THIS BRA...

421
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,573
IS REALLY BOTHERING ME.

422
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,076
YOU KNOW, THIS USED TO BE MY BEDROOM.

423
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,077
YEAH.

424
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,579
LOT OF MEMORIES IN HERE.

425
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,581
LOT OF MEMORIES.

426
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,584
IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'D SAY?

427
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,087
WANT TO HEAR SOME MEMORIES?

428
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,095
NEED A... NEED A LITTLE HAND THERE?

429
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,097
OH, NO, NO. I GOT THIS ALL UNDER CONTROL.

430
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,600
YOU REALLY DON'T SEEM LIKE YOU DO.

431
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,601
THAT'S...

432
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,106

433
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,607

434
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,109
FORGET IT!

435
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,110

436
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,611
THIS IS... FOR...

437
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,616
THIS IS NOT HOW THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

438
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,118
WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN?

439
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,122
CAN YOU NOT LOOK AT ME WHEN I SAY THIS?

440
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,629
I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD GET YOU HERE

441
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,633
I COULD SEDUCE YOU.

442
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,136
UH, EXCUSE ME?

443
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,138
SEDUCE YOU.

444
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,642
SEDUCE YOU.

445
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,644
HUH.

446
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,146

447
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:12,651
UH... I I DON'T WEAR... SUITS TO WORK

448
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,154
AND I BOUGHT SIX OF THEM FROM YOU.

449
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,156
WELL, I'M SORRY.

450
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,158
I THOUGHT YOU NEEDED THEM.

451
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,160
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

452
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,661
MY POINT IS, I KEPT COMING BACK

453
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,663
BECAUSE... I WANTED TO SEE YOU.

454
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,165
WHY?

455
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,167
BECAUSE I I LIKE YOU.

456
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,669
YOU LIKE ME?

457
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,171
YEAH.

458
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:36,675
I MEAN, YOU'RE YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL AND SMART AND SOPHISTICATED.

459
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,678
LOT OF THIS ISN'T, YOU KNOW, BASED ON TONIGHT.

460
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,181

461
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,682
BUT BUT YOU LIKE ME?

462
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,684
OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

463
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,188
ALL THIS TIME I LIKED YOU AND YOU LIKED ME.

464
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,689
BUT...

465
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,191
NO, NO. DON'T SAY "BUT."

466
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,193
NO, NO. BUT'S NEVER GOOD.

467
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,695
JUST LET'S LEAVE IT AT I LIKE YOU AND YOU LIKE ME.

468
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,698
OKAY. UH, HOWEVER...

469
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,202
NOW, SEE, THAT'S A FANCY "BUT."

470
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:08,207
MY MARRIAGE, LIKE, JUST ENDED

471
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:13,212
AND I'M REALLY NOT READY TO GET INTO ANYTHING YET.

472
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,215
BUT...

473
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,717
I'M SORRY.

474
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,220
I... I JUST NEED A LITTLE TIME.

475
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,225
OKAY.

476
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,730
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

477
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,232
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU BEFORE.

478
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,735
JOSHUA'S GONE, SO YOU AND EMILY ARE FREE TO GO.

479
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,736
IT'S OKAY.

480
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,240
SHE'S STILL IN THERE ENJOYING HER FAKE PARTY

481
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,741
AND, UH, IT'S TOO LATE

482
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,744
TO DO ANY OF THE STUFF I HAD PLANNED, SO...

483
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,747
OH, ROSS, I'M SORRY.

484
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,749
I COMPLETELY RUINED YOUR EVENING.

485
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,750

486
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,751
YEAH.

487
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,753
WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU

488
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:58,257
FEEL ANY BETTER, I MADE A FOOL OF MYSELF.

489
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,260
HELPS A LITTLE.

490
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,265
IS THERE ROOM ON THAT STEP FOR A PATHETIC LOSER?

491
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,766
YEAH. HAVE A SEAT.

492
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,771
OH...

493
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,775
I'M SO SORRY.

494
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,277
IT'S OKAY.

495
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,779
I MEAN, IT WAS JUST A TWO WEEK THING ANYWAY.

496
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,782
I JUST DIDN'T WANT IT TO END THIS WAY, YOU KNOW?

497
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:27,286
OR MAYBE YOU DIDN'T WANT IT TO END.

498
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,787
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

499
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,790
YOU SEEM TO REALLY LIKE HER.

500
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,795
YEAH. I REALLY DO.

501
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,797
YEAH, BUT WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

502
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,798
I MEAN, WE BOTH AGREED

503
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,800
IT WAS GOING TO BE A TWO WEEK THING.

504
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,802
YOU KNOW, NO COMMITMENT.

505
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:50,809
ROSS, THAT GIRL JUST SPENT THE ENTIRE EVENING

506
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,81
TALKING TO YOUR FRIENDS

507
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,314
YOU ASKING TO HEAR STORIES ABOUT

508
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,816
LOOKING THROUGH MONICA'S PHOTO ALBUMS.

509
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,818
I MEAN, YOU DON'T DO THAT

510
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,820
IF YOU'RE JUST IN IT FOR TWO WEEKS.

511
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,323
YOU THINK?

512
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,825

516
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,336

517
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,838
YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT.

521
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,854
I DON'T KNOW.

522
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,856
IT WAS YOU AND A BUNCH OF ALBINO KIDS.

523
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,361
OH, MY GOD.

524
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,862
THOSE WEREN'T ALBINO KIDS.

525
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:44,863
THAT WAS COMPUTER CAMP.

526
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,365
RACH.

527
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:50,869

00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,393
THEY'RE NOT TRUE.

538
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,894
NO. THEY'RE THEY'RE ALL TRUE.

539
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,397
