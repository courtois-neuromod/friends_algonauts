00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,743
YOU'RE RIGHT.

91
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,745
I APOLOGIZE, BUT I SHOULD TELL YOU

92
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,247

98
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,761
TO DEMONSTRATE HOW I CAN GET MY EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE FEET

99
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,763
INTO MY EVEN BIGGER MOUTH.

100
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,765

101
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,767

102
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,769

103
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,770
BEFORE I START

104
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,772
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I HAVE A COLD.

105
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,775
SO IF I SNEEZE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SONG

106
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,277
IT'S NOT ON PURPOSE.

107
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,780
OH, EXCEPT THE LAST VERSE OF "PEPPER PEOPLE."

108
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,781
OKAY?

109
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,283

115
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,798

00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,821
YOU'RE KIDDING. I LOVE HIM.

126
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,823
MY DAD USED TO MAKE ME STAY UP LATE

127
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,325
AND WATCH RERUNS WITH HIM.

128
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,327

00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,329

130
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,830

I NEVER WOULD HAVE...

135
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,342
OH, PLEASE!

136
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,346
SO, JOEY TELLS ME YOU TWO MET IN ACTING CLASS.

137
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,348
YEAH, THEY TEAMED US UP AS PARTNERS.

138
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,350
JOEY PICKED THREE SCENES FOR US TO DO.

139
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,352
ALL OF THEM HAD US MAKING OUT.

140
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,354
THAT'S A GOOD THING, ACTUALLY

141
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,357
BECAUSE, UH, HE USED TO MAKE ME REHEARSE WITH HIM.

142
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,360
OH OH OH OH OH!

143
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,361

00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,864
HEY, WAIT.

146
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,367

147
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,368
OH, MY GOD!

148
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,371
OH, IT'S ON, IT'S ON.

149
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,873

00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,380
HERE WE GO, LITTLE FELLA.

00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,881

152
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,383
WHAT ABOUT THE DUCK?

153
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,884
WELL, THE DUCK CAN SWIM.

154
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,386
OF COURSE.

?? WHY YOU STICK ON ME ??

158
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,400
?? BABY? ??

159
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,903
THANKS FOR THE LIGHTS, HONEY.

160
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,908
 WAY TO GO.

161
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,411
YOUR COLD MAKES YOU SOUND SO GREAT.

162
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,414
IT'S FUN. GOD, I LOVE HOW SEXY I AM.

163
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,916

164
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,919
KATH, WE SHOULD GET GOING.

165
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,921
WE'RE GOING TO BUY HAMSTERS.

166
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,922
OH...

167
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,424
I LOVE THOSE LITTLE GUYS.

168
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,925
NO, NO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

169
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,928
I... I WORK FOR A MEDICAL RESEARCHER.

170
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,431
WELL, HAVE FUN.

171
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,932
OKAY.

172
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,935
WELL, I THINK IT'S NICE THAT THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY

173
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,438
IS FINALLY TRYING TO HELP SICK HAMSTERS.

174
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,441
ISN'T IT? ISN'T IT?

175
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,942

I MEAN, WE WERE UP ALL LAST NIGHT TALKING.

183
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,956

184
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,958

185
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,462

SOME DEPRESSING STUFF TO GO WITH MY NEW BLUESY VOICE

201
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,997
BUT NOTHING THAT SAD

202
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,000
HAS EVER REALLY HAPPENED TO ME.

203
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,002
WELL, HOW ABOUT YOUR MOM DYING

204
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,005
OR HAVING TO LIVE ON THE STREETS WHEN YOU WERE 14?

205
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,007
UH HUH.

206
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,510
OH, YEAH, I COULD WRITE ABOUT THE TIME

207
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,512
MY HAIR DID THAT WHOO WHOO THING.

208
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,516
HEY.

209
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,517
HEY.

210
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,520
SO, I'M GOING OVER TO AMANDA'S TONIGHT...

211
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,522
RACHEL'S NOT HERE.

212
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,523
OH.

213
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,026
HOW'S IT GOING WITH HER?

214
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,528
GREAT, ACTUALLY.

215
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,030
I'M THINKING TONIGHT MAY BE THE NIGHT.

216
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,533
YEAH, THE KIDS ARE GOING TO PLAY TOGETHER

217
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,034
AND THEN, WHEN THEY'RE ASLEEP

218
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,037
I'M THINKING AMANDA AND I BREAK OPEN A BOTTLE OF WINE--

219
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,541
DO A LITTLE PLAYING OURSELVES.

220
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,044
HI, GUYS.

221
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,546
THIS IS JOSH.

222
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,047
JOSH, THESE ARE MY FRIENDS.

223
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,549
AND THAT'S ROSS.

224
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,051
HI, JOSH.

225
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,052
HI.

226
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,054
DUDES.

227
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,556
DID YOU PLAY IN COLLEGE?

228
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,557
OH, I STILL DO.

229
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,059
NEXT YEAR I HOPE TO MAKE VARSITY, THOUGH.

230
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,061
ROSS, DIDN'T YOU PLAY SOCCER

231
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,062
IN HIGH SCHOOL?

232
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,064
OH, NO, WAIT, THAT'S RIGHT.

233
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,067
YOU JUST ORGANIZED THEIR GAME SCHEDULES ON YOUR COMMODORE 64.

234
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,069
WELL, IT'S GETTING LATE.

235
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,572
I GOT TO GET TO THE GAME, SO I'M GOING TO HEAD.

236
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,573
OKAY.

237
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,079
I'LL MISS YOU.

238
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,582
DOPE!

239
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,088
WOW. CUTE ONE.

240
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,089
VERY CUTE.

241
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,591
I KNOW. ISN'T HE GREAT?

242
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,593
IT'S SO NICE TO FINALLY BE

243
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,595
IN A  FUN RELATIONSHIP, YOU KNOW?

244
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,598
THERE'S NOTHING BORING ABOUT HIM, AND, UH...

245
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,100
BET HE'S NEVER EVEN SET FOOT IN A MUSEUM.

246
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,102
WELL, MAYBE HE'LL GET TO GO SOON--

247
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,605
YOU KNOW, LIKE ON A CLASS TRIP OR SOMETHING.

248
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,610
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS REALLY GREAT ABOUT HIM?

249
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,612
OH, WHAT IS THE WORD FOR AN ADULT

250
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,114
WHO DOESN'T HAVE DINOSAUR TOYS IN THEIR BEDROOM?

251
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,616
OH...

252
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,622
WHAT WAS THAT?

253
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,123
MONICA KNOWS.

254
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,125
IT'S THIS DUMB THING THAT ROSS MADE UP

255
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,127
TO TRY TO FOOL OUR PARENTS.

256
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,130
IT'S A WAY OF GIVING THE FINGER WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING

257
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,633
TO GIVE IT.

258
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,636
I REMEMBER I CRIED THE NIGHT YOU MADE THAT UP.

259
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,138
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I REALIZED I WAS COOLER

260
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,140
THAN MY BIG BROTHER.

261
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,141
WELL.

262
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,644
I'M GOING TO GO GET READY...

263
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,151
FOR MY DATE TONIGHT, SO, UH...

264
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,153
I'LL JUST HEAD.

265
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,159
YEAH, I SHOULD GO, TOO, BECAUSE I'M PLAYING IN ONE HOUR.

266
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,661

267
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,664
YOU GUYS SHOULD COME HEAR ME.

268
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,166
OOH! HEAR ME-- OOH!

269
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,668
?? MY STICKY SHOES... ??

270
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,670
EWW! EWW! OH!

271
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,675
I LOST MY SEXY PHLEGM.

272
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,181
HI. HI.

273
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,182
HI, BEN.

274
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,684
WOW, YOU-- YOU LOOK GREAT.

275
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,685
THANKS.

276
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,687
OKAY. HEY, TOMMY.

277
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,188
I AM SO GLAD

278
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,691
THAT YOU COULD COME OVER TONIGHT.

279
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,692
OH, NO, NO.

280
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,693
IT'S MY PLEASURE.

281
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,194
MY CELL PHONE NUMBER IS RIGHT HERE

282
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,696
ON THE COUNTER.

283
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,699
PLEASE HELP YOURSELF TO ANYTHING IN THE FRIDGE.

284
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,701
I APPRECIATE THIS SO MUCH.

285
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,203
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GO OUT WITH THIS GUY

286
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,705
FOR, LIKE, A MONTH.

287
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,706
I I DON'T...

288
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,707
OH, I DON'T MEAN

289
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,208
TO BE A SQUARE

290
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,711
BUT I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT IF YOU'D WAIT

291
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,213
AND DRINK YOUR WINE AFTER THE KIDS  ARE ASLEEP.

292
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,217
OH, I BLOCKED THE ADULT CHANNELS

293
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,219
FOR THE OTHER BABY SITTERS

294
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,221
BUT THE CODE IS 4-3...

295
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,723
I'M FINE.

296
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,725
THANKS FOR THIS.

297
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,728
I HOPE I CAN DO THE SAME FOR YOU SOMETIME.

298
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,737
WHO WANTS TO MAKE SOME LONG DISTANCE CALLS?

299
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,748
KATHY!

300
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,250
KATHY! HI!

301
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,252
KATHY! KATHY!

302
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,262
KATHY!

303
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,269
FETCH! FETCH IT!

304
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,273
KATHY!

305
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,274
KATHY!

306
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,776
KATHY!

307
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,779
KATHY!

308
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,282
KATHY!

309
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,354
KA... KATHY.

310
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,857
HEY. CHANDLER, WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

311
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:12,858
WELL...

312
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,795
I JUST WANTED TO SAY, "HEY."

313
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,297
HEY.

314
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,299
OKAY.

315
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,801

316
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,808
OH, COME ON.

317
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,310
YOU'RE MAKING IT SOUND WORSE THAN IT WAS.

318
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,813
HER DATE TIPPED ME TEN DOLLARS.

319
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,819
PHEEBS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

320
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,821
OKAY, I WANT TO BE SEXY AGAIN

321
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,322
SO, I'M TRYING TO CATCH A COLD.

322
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,825
SHOULD BE EASY.

323
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,826
THEY'RE PRETTY COMMON.

324
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,327
PHOEBE, YOU'LL CATCH PNEUMONIA.

325
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,331
OKAY, YOU WERE RIGHT.

326
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,834
I'M IN LOVE WITH JOEY'S GIRLFRIEND.

327
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,335
WHAT? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

328
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,837
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

329
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,838
YOU BARELY KNOW HER.

330
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,339
I DON'T KNOW.

331
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,340
I CAN'T... I JU...

332
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,843
I CAN'T GET HER OUT OF MY HEAD, YOU KNOW?

333
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,845
I MEAN, I'M A VERY BAD PERSON.

334
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,847
I'M A VERY, VERY BAD PER...

335
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,348
I'M A HORRIBLE PERSON.

336
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,851
NO, YOU'RE NOT, CHANDLER.

337
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,352
WE STILL LOVE YOU, CHANDLER.

338
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,356

339
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,858
OH... GOSH, PHOEBE

340
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:19,859
I THINK I CAUGHT YOUR COLD.

341
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,861
YOU MEAN YOU STOLE IT.

342
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,363

343
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,366
DON'T COVER YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOU DO THAT.

344
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,368

345
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,870
OH...

346
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,872
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU.

347
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,374
REALLY.

348
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,376
YEAH, I TOLD HER ABOUT THE TIME YOU GOT DRUNK

349
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,879
AND FELL ASLEEP WITH YOUR HEAD IN THE TOILET.

350
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,881

351
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,382
RIGHT IN THERE.

352
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,385
WHAT MOVIE DID YOU GET?

353
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,888
I GOT WHAT I ALWAYS GET DIE HARD.

354
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,389
OH... AW...

355
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,892
SEE? THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT JOEY--

356
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,894
ANY OTHER GUY WOULD WOULD HAVE BEEN

357
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,898
"YEAH, THE ENGLISH PATIENT IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE, TOO."

358
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,901
BUT JOEY GOES, "NO WAY. LET'S GET DIE HARD.

359
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,403
I'M NOT WATCHING THAT ENGLISH CRAP."

360
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,906
YEAH, HE'S DREAMY.

361
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,909
I GOT TO GO.

362
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,411
I GOT TO GO MEET SOME FRIENDS.

363
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,416
HE HAS OTHER FRIENDS?

364
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,923
99...

365
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,424
100.

366
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,426
READY OR NOT, HERE I COME!

367
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,931
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO OVER THE CONCEPT

368
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,432
ONE MORE TIME.

369
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,433
HEY.

370
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,434
HEY.

371
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,436
LISTEN, YOU WANT TO GET SOME DINNER

372
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,938
WITH ME AND KATHY TONIGHT?

373
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,940
OH, UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?

374
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,942
I, UH, ALREADY ATE.

375
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,944
IT'S 4:30.

376
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,446
YEAH, WELL, I HAD A BIG MEAL ON MONDAY.

377
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,448
SO THAT'S JUST GOING TO GET ME

378
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,950
STRAIGHT THROUGH THE WEEK.

379
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,451
OKAY.

380
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,953
I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

381
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,456
YOU, YOU DO?

382
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,458
YEAH. YOU DON'T LIKE KATHY.

383
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,461
YOU GOT ME.

384
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,963
YEAH. YOU BEEN AVOIDING HER

385
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,464
EVER SINCE WE STARTED GOING OUT.

386
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,466
I MADE AN EFFORT TO LIKE JANICE.

387
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,469
IT'S YOUR TURN TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO LIKE KATHY

388
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,971
BY COMING OUT TO DINNER WITH US.

389
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,973
RIGHT? YEAH, RIGHT.

390
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,975
GOOD. AND, HEY, MY TREAT.

391
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,976
BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE

392
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,978
YOU'RE NOT EATING ANYTHING, RIGHT?

393
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,479
RIGHT.

394
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,486

395
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,991
SORRY, GRANDMA.

396
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,495
ROSS ISN'T HERE.

397
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,997
OH.

398
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,498
STOP IT!

399
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,503
SO, UH, I'LL SEE YOU AT THE PARTY?

400
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:48,007
FEAR'S FEAR, MAN, 24 SEVEN!

401
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,509
YEAH!

402
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,514
I AM SO GOING TO MARRY THAT GUY.

403
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,517
OH!

404
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,019
WHAT?

405
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,520
I THINK HE'S STEALING FROM ME.

406
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,522
WHY?

407
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,524
BECAUSE HE'S STEALING FROM ME.

408
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,026
OH!

409
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,028
HI. IT'S ME.

410
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,029
AND SOUP.

411
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,530
HEY, OH, I JUST SAW JOSH.

412
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,532
HE LOOKED SO YUMMY IN YOUR LEATHER JACKET.

413
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,035
OH!

414
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,039
HERE. NOW, I DON'T EAT CHICKEN

415
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,540
SO IT'S JUST NOODLE SOUP.

416
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,541
AND THERE'S

417
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,543
NO CHICKEN IN THE BROTH EITHER

418
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,545
SO, IT'S REALLY JUST NOODLE WATER.

419
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,050
THANK YOU SO MUCH, PHOEBE.

420
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,551
SURE.

421
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,553
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THOSE?

422
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,555
I NEED YOUR GERMS.

423
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,057
I WANT MY COLD BACK.

424
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,060
I MISS MY SEXY VOICE.

425
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,561
SORRY, PHOEBE.

426
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,563
THAT'S OKAY.

427
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,565
HOW'S THE SOUP?

428
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,567
MMM.

429
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,570
OHH!

430
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,571
GOD!

431
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,073
GROSS!

432
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,081

433
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,583
OH, MY GOD, YOU GUYS, CHECK IT OUT.

434
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,086
YOU CAN SEE THAT GIRL'S UNDERWEAR.

435
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,587
IS SHE GREAT OR WHAT?

436
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,588
SO? HUH?

437
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,090
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

438
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,593
UH, SHE'S... SHE'S NOT REALLY MY TYPE.

439
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,594
NOT YOUR TYPE?

440
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,595
SHE'S GORGEOUS.

441
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,097
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK IT IS?

442
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,100
I THINK IT'S THE FISHNET STOCKINGS, YOU KNOW?

443
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,602
WHENEVER I SEE A GIRL IN FISHNET STOCKINGS

444
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,104
IT REMINDS ME OF...

445
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,106
MY FATHER IN FISHNET STOCKINGS.

446
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,107
OKAY.

447
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,110
UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE MORE OF WHY YOU'RE SINGLE.

448
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,112
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A FRIEND YOU'D LIKE.

449
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,115
SHE'S REALLY PRETTY, AND THEN WE COULD DOUBLE DATE.

450
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,117
UH, NO, NO, THANKS.

451
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,619
OKAY. I'VE GOT SOME UGLY FRIENDS

452
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,621
AND THEY'RE ALL AVAILABLE, TOO.

453
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,624
LISTEN, I'M GOING TO GRAB A BEER.

454
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,127
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY?

455
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,134
WHAT WAS THAT?

456
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,635
WHAT?

457
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,637
KATHY WAS BEING NICE, AND YOU WALKED AWAY.

458
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,139
I THOUGHT WE HAD A DEAL.

459
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,141
LOOK, WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

460
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,642
I WANT YOU TO LIKE HER

461
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,644
BUT IF THAT'S TOO DAMN DIFFICULT FOR YOU

462
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,147
THEN THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS PRETEND.

463
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,648
I AM PRETENDING.

464
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,150
WELL, THEN DO IT BETTER.

465
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,653
WHAT DO YOU SAY I GO AND TELL HER HOW MUCH I LIKE HER?

466
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,655
I CAN TELL HER I BEEN THINKING ABOUT HER--

467
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,158
THAT I HAVEN'T STOPPED THINKING ABOUT HER

468
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,160
SINCE THE MOMENT WE MET

469
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,661
THAT I'M SO FANTASTICALLY OVER THE TOP

470
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,164
WANT TO SLIT MY OWN- THROAT IN LOVE WITH HER

471
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,666
THAT FOR EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY

472
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,170
I CAN'T BELIEVE MY OWN BAD LUCK THAT YOU MET HER FIRST!

473
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,172
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

474
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,677
BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO TONE IT DOWN A LITTLE.

475
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,183
OH, I STILL HAVE A FEVER?

476
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,685
YOU SURE THAT THING'S WORKING RIGHT?

477
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,687
WELL, WE COULD TAKE IT THE OTHER WAY.

478
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,692
HEY.

479
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,195
SO, UH, AMANDA JUST, JUST DROPPED ME OFF.

480
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,197
YOU KNOW, THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

481
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,199
I LOVE ABOUT HER.

482
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,701
SHE'S, UH, SHE'S OLD ENOUGH TO DRIVE.

483
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,204
SO, UH, I GUESS

484
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,706
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MOM AND DAD'S TONIGHT, HUH?

485
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,208
NO. SORRY.

486
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,709
WELL, WHERE'S AMANDA?

487
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,711
COULD YOU GET ME SOME COUGH DROPS?

488
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,713
YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING YOU COULD BRING HER

489
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,216
AND YOU GUYS COULD GO UP TO YOUR OLD ROOM

490
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,717
AND NOT MAKE OUT.

491
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,718

492
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,720
ROSS, A COUGH DROP, PLEASE?

493
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,722
AT LEAST I KNOW SHE'S NOT GOING OUT WITH ME

494
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,224
TO GET INTO "R"-RATED MOVIES.

495
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,725

496
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,727
WHY DON'T YOU JUST MARRY HER?

497
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,229
OH, NO, WAIT A MINUTE.

498
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,231
YOU CAN'T. I'M SORRY. I FORGOT.

499
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,732
SHE'S NOT A LESBIAN.

500
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,736
SEE, AMANDA AND I HAVE A...

501
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,737
YOU HAVE NOTHING!

502
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,740
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING OUT.

503
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,742
YOU'RE HER BABY SITTER.

504
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,245
YOU HAVE A 12 YEAR OLD GIRL'S JOB.

505
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,749

506
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,255
OH, THAT IS SO SAD.

507
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,257

00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,758
