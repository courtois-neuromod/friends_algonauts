1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,005

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,008

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,512

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,515
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,018

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,020
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,022
IS THAT YOU?

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,524

9
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,527
OH!

10
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,030
BOY, YOU ARE REALLY NOT A MORNING PERSON.

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,032
BACK OFF!

12
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,536
GET UP! GET UP! GET UP!

13
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,537
GET UP! GET UP!

14
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,040
GET UP! GET UP! GET UP!

15
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,544
WHAT IS THAT NOISE?

16
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,046
YOU.

17
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,049
IT'S THE CHICK.

18
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,053
SHE'S GOING THROUGH SOME CHANGES.

19
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,555
WHAT KIND OF CHANGES?

20
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,057
THE VET SEEMS TO THINK

21
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,559
THAT SHE'S BECOMING A ROOSTER.

22
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,562

23
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,065
WE'RE GETTING A SECOND OPINION.

36
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,116
HEY.

37
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,617
WHAT ARE YOU DOING SHOPPING

38
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,119
AT 8:00 IN THE MORNING?

39
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,620
WELL, I'VE BEEN UP SINCE 6:00

40
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,123
THANKS TO SOMEBODY'S DUMB ASS ROOSTER.

41
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,624
GUYS, YOU REALLY SHOULD GET RID

42
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,625
OF THOSE ANIMALS.

43
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,128
THEY SHOULDN'T BE LIVING IN AN APARTMENT.

44
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,631
ESPECIALLY NOT WITH ALL THESE KNIVES AND COOKBOOKS AROUND.

45
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,636
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO GO TO THE FERTILITY DOCTOR

46
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,639
AND SEE IF I'M READY TO HAVE FRANK AND ALICE'S EMBRYO

47
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,141
TRANSFERRED INTO MY UTERUS.

48
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,144
NOW, HOW WILL THEY KNOW IF YOU'RE READY?

49
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,645
THEY'RE GOING TO SEE

50
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,647
IF MY ENDOMETRIAL LAYER IS THICK.

51
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,650
WELL, I CAN, UH, CHECK THAT FOR YOU.

52
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,652
OKAY, EVERYONE, THINK THICK.

53
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,654
GOOD LUCK. GOOD LUCK.

54
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,156
HEY! HEY!

55
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,657
WISH ME LUCK.

56
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,159
OH... GOOD LUCK.

57
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,660
AND I'M STILL RIGHT.

58
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,662
THAT IS SO NOT TRUE.

59
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,663
WHAT?

60
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,166
SHE'S MAD BECAUSE I KNOW TODAY'S HER LAUNDRY DAY

61
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,669
AND THAT MEANS SHE'S WEARING HER OLD LADY UNDERPANTS.

62
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,674
WELL, I CAN CHECK THAT FOR YOU.

63
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,676
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU THINK

64
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,179
THAT YOU AND CHANDLER KNOW ME AND RACHEL BETTER

65
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,680
THAN WE KNOW YOU.

66
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,182
WELL, WE DO.

67
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,185
YOU CAN ONLY EAT TIC TACS IN EVEN NUMBERS.

68
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,187
YEAH, WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

69
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,189
AND YOU...

70
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,691
ROSS, I BELIEVE IF YOU CHECK RACHEL'S BAG

71
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,694
YOU WILL FIND A HALF EATEN BOX OF COOKIES IN THERE.

72
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,200
YOU'RE GOOD.

73
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,703
THESE ARE NOT.

74
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,205
SO NOT IMPRESSED.

75
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,207
EVERYBODY SNACKS WHEN THEY SHOP.

76
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,208
OH, YEAH?

77
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,710
ROSS, HOW MANY ITEMS LEFT IN THAT BAG?

78
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,711
FIVE.

79
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,713
OKAY, TEN BUCKS SAYS

80
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:37,217
THAT WE CAN NAME EVERY ITEM IN THAT BAG.

81
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,219
HOW MANY GUESSES DO YOU GET?

82
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,220
SIX.

83
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,721
CHALLENGE EXTENDED.

84
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,224
DEAL.

85
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,726
CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.

86
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,728
ALL RIGHT.

87
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,230
WE'LL START WITH...

88
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,232
APPLES.

89
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,735
WE'LL BE STARTING WITH APPLES.

90
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,239
STOP THAT NOW.

91
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,741
YES.

92
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,744
OKAY, UH, TORTILLA CHIPS, YOGURT...

93
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,746
DIET SODA...

94
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,248
YES, YES...

95
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,749
YES.

96
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,252
ORANGE JUICE.

97
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,753
THERE'S NO ORANGE JUICE IN THERE.

98
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,754
WE WIN!

99
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,257
THEY HAVE ANOTHER GUESS.

100
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,760
OKAY, WELL, WE WON THAT ONE.

101
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,263
OKAY, THE LAST THING IS...

102
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,265
OOH, OOH! OOH! OOH, OOH!

103
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,270
NO. NO. NOT FOR LIKE ANOTHER TWO WEEKS.

104
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,274
I GOT IT.

105
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,775
SCOTCH...

106
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,776
TAPE.

107
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,779
HA!

108
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,784
HOW DID YOU KNOW SHE WOULD BUY SCOTCH TAPE?

109
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,288
WELL, WE USED UP THEIRS LAST NIGHT MAKING SCARY FACES.

110
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,790
OH, MAN.

111
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,792
ALL RIGHT, TEN BUCKS.

112
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,793
FORK IT OVER.

113
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,295
COUGH IT UP.

114
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,297
PAY THE PIPER.

115
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,299
GIVE ME IT.

116
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,801
THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU KNOW US BETTER.

117
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,802
I WANT A REMATCH.

118
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,305
AND NONE OF THESE STUPID GROCERY QUESTIONS.

119
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,806
REAL PERSONAL QUESTIONS.

120
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,309
YEAH, AND THE WINNER GETS A HUNDRED BUCKS.

121
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,810
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

122
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,313
ARE YOU SCARED?

123
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,316
NO.

124
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,819
OKAY, WHO MAKES UP THE QUESTIONS?

125
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,821
ROSS'LL DO IT.

126
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,323
OH, SURE, ROSS'LL DO IT.

127
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,326
IT'S NOT LIKE HE HAS A JOB OR A CHILD

128
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,827
OR A LIFE OF HIS OWN.

129
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,829
WELL, FINE. WE'LL ASK PHOEBE.

130
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,331
NO. I WANT TO PLAY.

131
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,337
LOOKS LIKE YOUR UTERUS

132
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,339
IS READY FOR IMPLANTATION.

133
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,840
OH, I KNEW IT.

134
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,343
I FELT REALLY THICK THIS MORNING.

135
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,345
WELL, OKAY, SO, WHAT'S NOW?

136
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,846
GO GO GET THE EGGS.

137
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:47,847
PUT THEM IN THERE.

138
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,350
OKAY. IT'LL TAKE JUST A LITTLE WHILE

139
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,851
TO PREPARE THE EMBRYOS.

140
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,852
EMBRYOS?

141
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,354
AS IN MORE THAN ONE.

142
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,855
FIVE, ACTUALLY.

143
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,857
FIVE? OKAY, WHERE AM I GIVING BIRTH?

144
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,360
IN A HOSPITAL OR A BIG BOX UNDER THE STAIRS?

145
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,861
WE DO FIVE

146
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,364
BECAUSE THAT GIVES YOU A 25% CHANCE

147
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,865
THAT AT LEAST ONE WILL ATTACH.

148
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,867
THAT'S IT? 25 PERCENT?

149
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,868
THAT MEANS THAT IT'S

150
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,871
LIKE 75 PERCENT CHANCE OF NO BABY AT ALL?

151
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,873
YEAH, YOU KNOW , I WAS THINKING.

152
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,377
WHAT ARE THE ODDS IF YOU STUFF 200 OF THEM IN THERE?

153
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,880
SWEETIE, NOW, SHE'S A WOMAN

154
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,882
NOT A GUM BALL MACHINE.

155
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,886
OKAY, WELL, DO N'T WORRY, YOU GUYS

156
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,889
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO DO THIS AS MANY TIMES AS IT TAKES

157
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,890
TO GET IT RIGHT.

158
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,892
WELL, SEE, THE THING IS

159
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,395
WE KIND OF ONLY HAVE ONE SHOT.

160
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,898
IT COSTS $16,000 EACH TIME YOU DO THIS.

161
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,900
$16,000 DOLLAR?!

162
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,904
I IT'S 20 IN CALIFORNIA.

163
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,407
UM, WE'RE...

164
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,409
WE'RE KIND OF USING ALL THE MONEY WE HAVE

165
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,411
JUST TO DO IT THIS ONE TIME.

166
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,912
WHOA!

167
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,415
THAT'S... OKAY, THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE

168
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,417
ON ME AND MY UTERUS.

169
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,420
SO, WELL, OKAY.. . SO, MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING I CAN DO

170
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,923
YOU KNOW, JUST TO, LIKE, HELP MAKE SURE I GET PREGNANT.

171
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,425
NO. I'M SORRY.

172
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,428
WOW. YOU GUYS REALLY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

173
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,431
WHY DON'T YOU GET DRUNK?

174
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,933
THAT WORKED FOR A BUNCH OF GIRLS

175
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,435
IN MY HIGH SCHOOL.

176
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,442
SO, HOW'S THE TEST COMING?

177
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,945
HEY, HEY, HEY, YOU'RE TOUCHING THE GAME BOARD.

178
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,947
SORRY.

179
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,949
YOU FREAK.

180
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,454
HEY, GUYS, DO YOU REALIZE

181
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,458
THAT ANY MINUTE NOW, PHOEBE COULD BE PREGNANT.

182
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,959
I KNOW. I KNOW.

183
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,462
IT'S SUCH A HUGE, LIFE ALTERING THING.

184
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,465
I KNOW. IT IS.

185
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,466
THE TEST IS READY.

186
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,469

187
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,473
OKAY, EACH TEAM WILL ANSWER TEN QUESTIONS.

188
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:58,478
THE FIRST TEAM TO ANSWER THE MOST QUESTIONS WINS.

189
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,481
THE CATEGORIES ARE "FEARS AND PET PEEVES"

190
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,483
"ANCIENT HISTORY"

191
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,485
"LITERATURE"

192
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,488
AND "IT'S ALL RELATIVE."

193
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,990
NOW...

194
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,994
THE COIN TOSS, TO SEE WHO GOES FIRST.

195
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,002
OKAY...

196
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,004
SOMEBODY CALL IT THIS TIME.

197
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,006
YEAH. OKAY.

198
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,508
TAILS!

199
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,009

00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,951
TO DO WITH NUMBERS?

385
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,952
AND PROCESSING.

386
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,453
AND HE CARRIES A BRIEFCASE.

387
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,455
YOU NEED THIS, OR YOU LOSE THE GAME.

388
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,458
IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH TRANSPONDING.

389
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,461
OH, OH, HE'S A TRANSPONDS- TRANSPONSTER!

390
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,965
THAT'S NOT EVEN A WORD!

391
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,967
OH!

392
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,469
I CAN GET THIS! I CAN...

393
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,470

394
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,472
NO!!!

395
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,974
YES! YES!

396
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,487
I CALL MONICA'S ROOM.

397
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,489
YOU CAN'T JUST CALL MONICA'S ROOM.

398
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,490
SURE, I CAN.

399
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,992
STANDARD SHOTGUN RULES.

400
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,493
I'M IN SIGHT OF THE ROOM

401
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,996
AND I CALLED IT.

402
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,500
MAN, I FEEL LIKE I'M COMING DOWN WITH SOMETHING.

403
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,002
OOH. YEAH.

404
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,003

405
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,504
WHAT COLOR  MY TONSILS ARE.

406
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,505
I'LL BET THE APARTMENT.

407
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,507
I WOULD NEVER BET THIS APARTMENT.

408
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,508
IT'S TOO NICE.

409
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:52,511
HEY.

410
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,513
OOH, PHEEBS, ARE THEY IN THERE?

411
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,515
UM, YEAH, UH HUH, I'M IMPLANTED.

412
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,516
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

413
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,019
WELL, FREAKED.

414
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,522
IT TURNS OUT THE ODDS ARE, LIKE, REALLY SUCKY

415
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,525
AND THIS IS FRANK AND ALICE'S, LIKE, ONLY SHOT.

416
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,027
THEY ARE, LIKE, LITERALLY

417
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,529
PUTTING ALL THEIR EGGS IN MY BASKET.

418
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,532
YEAH, BUT I BET IT WORKS.

419
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,534
REALLY? HOW MUCH?

420
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,537
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO GO

421
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,539
TAKE A PREGNANCY TEST RIGHT NOW.

422
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,042
OH, WOW. YOU CAN TELL THIS SOON?

423
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,044
WELL, THE DOCTOR SAYS IT TAKES A COUPLE DAYS

424
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,046
BUT MY BODY'S ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE FASTER

425
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,547
THAN WESTERN MEDICINE, SO...

426
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,551

427
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,552
OH, MY GOD.

428
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,054
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS

429
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,056
ACTUALLY THINK YOU'RE MOVING IN HERE.

430
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,557
WELL, BELIEVE IT, BABY.

431
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,061
WELL, I I, I'M NOT MOVING.

432
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,063
WHAT?!

433
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,065
NO. IT WAS A STUPID BET.

434
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,067
WE WERE JUST PLAYING A GAME.

435
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,568
YOU CAN'T JUST IGNORE THE BET.

436
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,070
IT'S A BET.

437
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,571
YOU BET ON A BET, AND IF YOU LOSE

438
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,573
YOU LOSE THE BET.

439
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,075
RACH, WE HAVE TO MOVE.

440
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,577
IF WE HAD LOST, WE WOULD HAVE MADE THEM

441
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,079
GET RID OF THE BIRDS, RIGHT?

442
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,080
NO.

443
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,583
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I HATE THIS

444
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,586
AS MUCH AS YOU, BUT... IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER

445
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,088
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

446
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,091
WHAT?!

447
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,592
"CHANANDLER BONG."

448
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,095
COME ON, WE STEAL THATTV GUIDEEVERY WEEK.

449
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,596
I KNEW IT!

450
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,099
I DON'T CARE.

451
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,600
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

452
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,103
COOL. GIRL ROOMMATE.

453
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,606
WELL?

454
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,109
NOPE, NOT KNOCKED UP YET.

455
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,611
ALL RIGHT, WELL, IT'S ONLY BEEN A COUPLE HOURS

456
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,113
SO, JUST GIVE IT SOME TIME.

457
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,614
YEAH, ALL RIGHT. MEANWHILE

458
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,116
I'M GOING TO DO WHATEVER I CAN

00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,618

460
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,120

461
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,622
YOU KNOW, JUST... YEAH, GOOD.

462
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,625
I'M GOING TO LET GRAVITY, YOU KNOW, DO ITS JOB.

463
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,128
I WON'T GET IN THE WAY.

464
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,629
IT'LL BE JUST LIKE THAT TIME

465
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,132
I TRIED TO COUNT ALL THE BUMPS ON YOUR CEILING.

466
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,636
YOU KNOW, PHEEBS, IF YOU SIT THERE LONG ENOUGH

467
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,139
YOU'LL BE SITT ING IN OUR APARTMENT.

468
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,141
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

469
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,642
OH, RACH, F.Y.I., YOUR NEW APARTMENT

470
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,644
HASN'T HAD HOT WATER SINCE CHRISTMAS.

471
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,651
HEY, RACH, CAN YOU GIVE ME A HAND WITH THIS BOX?

472
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,653
NO! PUT THAT BOX DOWN!

473
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,655
WE ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE!

474
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,160
THIS IS MY APARTMENT, AND I LIKE IT!

475
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,162
THIS IS A "GIRLS'" APARTMENT!

476
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,664
THAT IS A "BOYS'" APARTMENT!

477
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,666
IT'S DIRTY AND IT SMELLS!

478
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,667
THIS IS PRETTY!

479
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,669
IT'S SO PRETTY!

480
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,172
AND LOOK, AND IT'S PURPLE!

481
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,175

482
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,678
I AM NOT MOVING, AND NOW I HAVE GOT THE STEADY HAND.

00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,184
OKAY. OKAY. SHH.

00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,188

487
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,193

488
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,702
HOW'D IT GO?

489
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,704
I LOST OUR MATTRESSES.

490
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,709

491
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,711
?? ARE YOU IN THERE, LITTLE FETUS? ??

492
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,714

?? IN NINE MONTHS, WILL YOU COME GREET US...? ?

493
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,219
?? I WILL BUY YOU SOME ADIDAS... ??

494
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,720

495
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,224
HI. HEY.

496
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,726
OH, HI. PHOEBE, UM...

497
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,728
WE WERE JUST AT THE DRUGSTORE

498
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,231
UM, SO WE GOT YOU A LITTLE PRESENT.

499
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,234
OH, WHOA, THAT'S WHERE ALL MY BLOOD WAS.

500
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:39,738
UM, IT'S A LOLLIPOP AND, UH, A HOME PREGNANCY TEST.

501
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,241
DON'T MIX THOSE UP.

502
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,244
YOU COULD REALLY RUIN THAT LOLLIPOP.

503
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:50,249
SO, UM... YOU FEEL LIKE TAKING A TEST?

504
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,251
THERE'S ONLY ONE QUESTION.

505
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,253

506
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,254
A ALL RIGHT, I WILL.

507
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,756
I WILL, BUT, UM, YOU KNOW, JUST REMEMBER

508
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,258
THAT IT'S STILL REALLY EARLY

509
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,260
SO, IF IT SAYS THAT I'M NOT PREGNANT

510
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,263
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M NOT GOING TO GET PREGNANT

511
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,265
OKAY? AND, AND JUST PLEASE

512
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,267
JUST SO I DON'T  GO COMPLETELY NUTS

513
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,270
JUST TRY NOT TO PUT ALL YOUR HOPES ON THIS

514
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,271
OKAY?

515
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,273
OKAY. OKAY.

516
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,275
GREAT.

517
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,283

518
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,284
YOU KNOW WHAT?

519
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,787
YOU ARE MEAN BOYS WHO ARE JUST BEING MEAN.

520
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,289
HEY, DON'T GET MAD AT US.

521
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,291
NO ONE FORCED YOU TO RAISE THE STAKES.

522
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,792
THAT IS NOT TRUE!

523
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,793
SHE DID! SHE FORCED ME!

524
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,796
WE'D STILL BE HERE, BUT YOU GOT THE QUESTION WRONG.

525
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,299
WELL, IT WAS A STUPID, UNFAIR QUESTION.

526
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,800
DON'T BLAME THE QUESTIONS.

527
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,803
WOULD YOU ALL STOP YELLING IN OUR APARTMENT?!

528
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,805
YOU ARE RUINING MOVING DAY FOR US!

529
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,307
STOP CALLING IT YOUR APARTMENT!

530
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,308
IT IS OUR APARTMENT!

531
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,310

532
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,313
YOU GUYS, YOU GUYS, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BABY.

533
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,814
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A BABY!

534
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,823
MY SISTER'S GOING TO HAVE MY BABY!

535
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,335
OKAY, BUT THIS CAN'T BE GOOD FOR THE BABY.

536
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,339

537
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,350
I CAN'T FIND GARBAGE BAGS.

538
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,352
OH, WELL, I THINK I SAW SOME IN HERE.

539
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,853

540
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,858
WHAT IS IT?

541
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,360
I DON'T KNOW

542
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,862
BUT MAYBE IF WE KEEP THAT DRAWER SHUT

543
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,864
IT'LL DIE.

544
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,867
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE LIVING HERE!

545
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,872

546
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,874
WHA...? WH WHAT IS IT?!

547
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,876
DID YOU SEE THE SIZE OF THE CLOSETS?!

548
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,381
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE LIVE HERE!

549
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,389
OH...! OH...!

550
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,391
OH!!! OH!!!
