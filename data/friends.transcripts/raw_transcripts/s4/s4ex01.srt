1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,004
OKAY, SO WE WENT TO THE BEACH

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,505
BECAUSE PHOEBE FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS LADY

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,007
WHO KNEW HER MOM AND DAD.

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,508
AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT.

5
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,010
I'M YOUR MOTHER.

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,511
HUH?

7
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,512
THEN MONICA JOKED THAT SHE WOULDN'T GO OUT

8
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,514
WITH A GUY LIKE CHANDLER

9
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,016
AND HE COULDN'T LET GO.

10
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,517
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT EITHER.

11
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:20,020
THEN ROSS' NEW GIRLFRIEND BONNIE SHOWS UP

12
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,522
AND RACHEL CONVINCED HER TO SHAVE HER HEAD.

13
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,024
THEN ROSS AND RACHEL KISS.

14
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,527
NOW ROSS HAS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN RACHEL AND THE BALD GIRL.

15
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,030
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THERE EITHER.

16
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,031
YOU KNOW WHAT? HOLD ON.

17
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,033
I'M GOING TO GO GET CHANDLER.

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,046
HI.

19
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,048
HEY. HI.

20
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,550
RACHEL WAS JUST HELPING ME OUT.

21
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,552
MY HEAD GOT ALL SUNBURNED.

22
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,554
AW.

23
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,056
THANKS A MILLION.

24
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,558
OH, YOU'RE WELCOME A MILLION.

25
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,560
SMELL IT.

26
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,064
MMM! MINTY.

27
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,068
OKAY, I'LL BE IN OUR ROOM.

28
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,569
OKAY.

29
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,584
OH, MY GOD.

30
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,585
I KNOW.

31
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,091
OKAY, I GOT TO GO.

32
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,592
ROSS... WHAT?

33
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,595
I GOT TO GO BREAK UP WITH BONNIE.

34
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,098
HERE? NOW?

35
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,099
WELL, YEAH.

36
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,101
I CAN'T STAY HERE ALL NIGHT.

37
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,603
IF I GO IN THERE, SHE'S GOING TO WANT TO...

38
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,105
DO STUFF.

39
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,606
CAN'T YOU JUST TELL HER

40
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,608
THAT YOU ARE NOT IN THE MOOD?

41
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,110
NO, SHE LIKES THAT.

42
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,112
FAKING SLEEP DOESN'T WORK EITHER.

43
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,615
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY MORNINGS I WOKE UP WITH HER...

44
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,117
EW.

45
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,118
OKAY.

46
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,121
WHY AM I TELLING YOU THAT?

47
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,123
I DON'T KNOW.

48
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,630
UM...

49
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,133
IT WASN'T EVERY MORNING.

50
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,134
OH, MAKING IT WORSE.

51
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,136
OKAY.

65
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,687
SO I GUESS YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW IT ALL HAPPENED.

66
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,689
I I MEAN, I THINK I CAN FIGURE IT OUT.

67
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,191
I GUESS I WAS BORN

68
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,693
AND THEN EVERYONE STARTED LYING THEIR ASSES OFF.

69
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,196
NO, NO, NO. IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

70
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,699
REMEMBER HOW I TOLD YOU HOW LILY AND FRANK AND I--

71
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,700
WE WERE CLOSE?

72
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,703
WELL, WE WERE VERY CLOSE.

73
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,205
HOW CLOSE?

74
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,707
WELL, THE THREE OF US--

75
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,709
WE WERE KIND OF A COUPLE.

76
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,712
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW THAT WOULD WORK.

77
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,713
WELL, WE WOULD...

78
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,714
I'M NOT ASKING.

79
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,718
WELL, ANYHOW, SOMEHOW, I GOT PREGNANT

80
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,720
AND I WAS...

81
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,222
SCARED.

82
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,723
I WAS STUPID AND SELFISH AND...

83
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,225
I WAS 18 YEARS OLD.

84
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,227
I MEAN, YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE

85
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,229
TO BE 18 YEARS OLD, DON'T YOU?

86
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,230
YEAH.

87
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,731
LET'S SEE...

88
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,234
MY MOM HAD KILLED HERSELF AND MY DAD HAD RUN OFF

89
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,237
AND I WAS LIVING IN A GREMLIN WITH A GUY NAMED CINDY

90
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,239
WHO TALKED TO HIS HAND.

91
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,240
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

92
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,242
I THOUGHT I WAS LEAVING YOU

93
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,244
WITH THE BEST PARENTS IN THE WORLD.

94
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,246
I DIDN'T EVEN HEAR ABOUT YOUR MOM AND DAD

95
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,747
TILL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

96
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,749
BY THEN, YOU WERE ALREADY GROWN UP.

97
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,251
I DON'T KNOW, YOU'RE HERE

98
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,252
AND I WOULD REALLY...

99
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,254
I WOULD LIKE TO GET TO KNOW YOU.

100
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,256
YEAH, WELL, EVERYBODY DOES.

101
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,258
I'M A REALLY COOL PERSON.

102
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,761
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU HAD 29 YEARS TO FIND THAT OUT

103
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,763
BUT YOU DIDN'T EVEN TRY.

104
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,765
YOU KNOW WHAT?

105
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,766
YOU WALKED OUT ON ME.

106
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,268
I'M DOING THE SAME TO YOU.

107
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,269
WAIT.

108
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,772
I DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

109
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,275

110
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,277
WHERE'S MY PURSE?

111
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,281
SHOOT. WE'RE OUT OF SODA.

112
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,782
I'LL GO OUT AND GET YOU SOME.

113
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,284
REALLY?

114
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,786
NOPE, BECAUSE I'M NOT YOUR BOYFRIEND.

115
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,790
 HEY, PHEEBS, HOW'D IT GO?

116
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,792
WELL...

117
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,794
MY MOM'S FRIEND PHOEBE

118
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,796
IS ACTUALLY MY BIRTH MOM.

119
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,302
I FOUND A DRIED UP SEA HORSE.

120
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,803
SWEETIE, WHAT ARE

121
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,804
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

122
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,306
OH, MY NEW MOM

123
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,308
WHO'S A BIG, FAT ABANDONER.

124
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,809
WELL, PHEEBS, WAIT A SECOND.

125
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,812
DON'T YOU WANT TO STAY HERE AND TALK ABOUT IT?

126
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,314
NO. I WANT...

127
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,316
I NEED TO BE ALONE.

128
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,320
MONICA?!

129
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,821
OH.

130
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,827
MAN.

131
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,829
HEY, WHAT IF YOU FOUND OUT

132
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,332
THAT YOUR MOM WASN'T REALLY YOUR MOM

133
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,835
AND YOUR NEW MOM TURNED OUT TO BE REALLY HOT?

134
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,837
OH, MAN, HUH?

135
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,841
M. BUT IT'S YOUR MO

136
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,345
NO. I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR MOM.

137
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,856
IT'S OVER.

138
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,859
OH. WAS IT AWFUL?

139
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,861
WELL, IT WAS LONG.

140
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,364
I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE HOW LATE IT WAS

141
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,866
TILL I NOTICED THE 5:00 SHADOW

142
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,368
ON HER HEAD.

143
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,369

144
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,374
ANYWAY, SHE DIDN'T WANT TO STAY.

145
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,875
I CALLED A CAB.

146
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,377
SHE JUST LEFT.

147
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,386
I WROTE YOU A LETTER.

148
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,388
OH, THANK YOU.

149
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,391
I LIKE MAIL.

150
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,898
THERE'S JUST SOME THINGS I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT--

151
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,901
THINGS ABOUT US-- AND, BEFORE I CAN EVEN THINK

152
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,904
ABOUT THE TWO OF US GETTING BACK TOGETHER

153
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,906
I JUST NEED TO KNOW HOW YOU FEEL

154
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,409
ABOUT THIS STUFF.

155
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,910
OKAY.

156
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,417
IT'S...

157
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,919
IT'S 5:30 IN THE MORNING.

158
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,926
SO... I BETTER GET CRACKING ON THIS BABY.

159
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,928
SO, I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU.

160
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,431
JUST COME UP WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

161
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,432
OKAY.

162
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,934
I'LL BE UP IN...

163
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,936
18 PAGES.

164
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,939
FRONT AND BACK.

165
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,943
IT'S VERY EXCITING.

166
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,462
OH, OH, OH.

167
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,469
HEY.

168
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,970
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

169
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,971
WHY DIDN'T YOU COME UP?

170
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,473
DONE.

171
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,976
YOU JUST FINISHED?

172
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,978
WELL, I WANTED TO BE THOROUGH.

173
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,481
I MEAN, THIS IS CLEARLY

174
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,983
.
VERY, VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU..

175
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,984
TO US.

176
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,988
.
SO I WANTED TO READ EVERY WORD CAREFULLY..

177
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,989
TWICE.

178
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,493
SO, UM...

179
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,995
DOES IT?

180
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,002
SORRY?

181
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,006
DOES IT?

182
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,008
DOES IT?

183
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,511
DOESIT?

184
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:38,017
YEAH, I WANTED TO GIVE THAT WHOLE "DOES IT" PART

185
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,519
JUST ANOTHER GLANCE.

186
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,020
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, ROSS?

187
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,022
YOU JUST SAID YOU READ IT TWICE.

188
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,524
LOOK, IT EITHER DOES OR IT DOESN'T

189
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,026
AND IF YOU HAVE TO EVEN THINK ABOUT IT...

190
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,528
NO, NO, RACH, NO, I DON'T.

191
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,530
I DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT. I DON'T.

192
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,531
IN FACT...

193
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,032
I'VE DECIDED.

194
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,535
I HAVE DECIDED THAT...

195
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,036
THAT IT...

196
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,544
DOES.

197
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,547

198
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,061
ARE YOU SURE?

199
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,063
SURE, I'M SURE.

200
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,572
ALL RIGHT, THERE'S A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST.

201
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,575
I'M THE LAST MAN ON EARTH.

202
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,076
WOULD YOU GO OUT WITH ME?

203
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,079
EHH.

204
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,584
I'VE GOT CANNED GOODS.

205
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,588
HEY, GUYS, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

206
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,590
CHECK THIS BABY OUT.

207
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,091
DUG ME A HOLE.

208
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,596
EXCELLENT HOLE, JOE.

209
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,098
OH, NO!

210
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,099
MY HOLE!

211
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,602
OW! OW!

212
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,103
WHAT IS IT?

213
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,605
JELLYFISH STING!

214
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,606
IT HURTS! IT HURTS!

215
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,107
CAN WE HELP YOU?

216
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,109
YOU WANT US TO TAKE YOU BACK TO THE HOUSE?

217
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,611
IT'S, LIKE, TWO MILES.

218
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,113
AND I'M A LITTLE TIRED FROM DIGGING THE HOLE.

219
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,114
OW! OW!

220
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,116
DAMN THE JELLYFISH!

221
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,619
DAMN ALL THE JELLYFISH!

222
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,621
WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

223
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,122
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING YOU CAN DO.

224
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,624
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

225
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,125
YOU HAVE TO PEE ON IT.

226
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,126
WHAT?!

227
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,628
GROSS!

228
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,629
DON'T BLAME ME.

229
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,131
I SAW IT ON THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL.

230
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,633
YOU KNOW WHAT? HE'S RIGHT.

231
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,135
THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE AMMONIA IN THAT

232
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,637
THAT KILLS THE PAIN.

233
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,138
WELL, FORGET IT.

234
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,640
IT DOESN'T HURT THAT...

235
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,141
BAD!

236
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,144
IF YOU WANT SOME PRIVACY, YOU CAN USE MY HOLE.

237
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,651
WELL, I'M READY TO GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

238
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,153
OH...

239
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,655
ARE YOU...?

240
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,656
ARE YOU?!

241
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,158
OH, THAT'S SO GREAT!

242
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,660
OOH, NOT FOR BONNIE.

243
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,163
BUT FOR YOU, YAY.

244
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,165
HEY.

245
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,667
 HOW WAS THE BEACH?

246
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,669
NOTHING. I DON'T KNOW.

247
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,672
WHAT HAPPENED?

248
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,173
NOTHING.

249
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,175
I'M GOING TO TAKE A SHOWER.

250
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,176
ME, TOO.

251
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,178
ME, TOO.

252
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,681
OKAY, I'M GOING TO PUT THIS IN THE CAR.

253
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,683
OH, I HAVE TO GO PACK.

254
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,184
OH.

255
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,686
AND IT REALLY DOES?

256
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,687
IT DOES.

257
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,189
IT REALLY AND TRULY DOES.

258
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,215
IT SO DOES NOT!

259
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,723
SHE WANTS ME TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

260
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,225
FOR EVERYTHING THAT WENT WRONG IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.

261
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,728
I MEAN, SHE GOES ON FOR FIVE PAGES

262
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,231
ABOUT HOW I WAS UNFAITHFUL TO HER.

263
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,234
WE WERE ON A BREAK!

264
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,737
OH, MY GOD! IF YOU SAY THAT ONE MORE TIME

265
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,238
I'M GOING TO BREAK UP WITH YOU.

266
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,742
FINE, FINE. BUT THIS BREAKUP WAS NOT ALL MY FAULT

267
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,744
AND SHE SAYS HERE

268
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,746
"IF YOU ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY..."

269
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,247
FULL RESPONSIBILITY!

270
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,249
"I CAN BEGIN TO TRUST YOU AGAIN.

271
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,752
"DOES THAT SEEM LIKE SOMETHING YOU CAN DO?

272
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,253
DOES IT?!"

273
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,757
NO?

274
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,260
YOU HAVE WHAT YOU WANT. YOU HAVE WHAT YOU WANT.

275
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,762
YOU'RE BACK WITH RACHEL.

276
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,763
IF YOU BRING THIS UP NOW

277
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,265
YOU WILL WRECK THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU.

278
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,767
YEAH, I KNOW.

279
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,268
YOU'RE RIGHT.

280
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,269

281
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,271
YEAH, I GUESS I'LL LET IT GO.

282
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,773
BUT YOU... YOU UNDERSTAND

283
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,775
HOW HARD IT IS TO FORGET ABOUT THIS.

284
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,276
SURE, IT'S HARD TO FORGET

285
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,279
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

286
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,282
A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENED ON THAT TRIP

287
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,786
THAT WE SHOULD NEVER, EVER TALK ABOUT.

288
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,791
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED ON THAT BEACH?

289
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,796
IT'S BETWEEN US AND THE SEA, ROSS.

290
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,806
HI, URSULA.

291
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,807
HEY.

292
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,308
OKAY, WELL, I KNOW

293
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,811
THAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED IN A LONG TIME

294
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,812
BUT, UM, OKAY...

295
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,314
OUR MOM IS NOT OUR BIRTH MOM.

296
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,817
THIS OTHER LADY IS OUR BIRTH MOM.

297
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,820
RIGHT. OKAY. THE ONE THAT LIVES IN MONTAUK. MM HMM.

298
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,321
YOU KNOW HER?

299
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,325
NO. I, UM, I READ ABOUT HER IN MOM'S SUICIDE NOTE.

300
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,828
THERE WAS A SUICIDE NOTE?

301
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,330
DO YOU STILL HAVE IT?

302
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,332
HANG ON.

303
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,837
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T TELL ME

304
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,338
THERE WAS A SUICIDE NOTE.

305
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,340
YEAH. SO HOW HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?

306
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,843
I'VE... UH... SHUT UP.

307
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,849
"GOOD BYE, PHOEBE AND URSULA.

308
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:10,850
"I'LL MISS YOU.

309
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,853
P.S. YOUR MOM LIVES IN MONTAUK."

310
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,856
YOU JUST WROTE THIS!

311
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:21,360
WELL, IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE GIST...

312
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,362
EXCEPT FOR THE POEM.

313
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,864
YOU READ THE POEM, RIGHT?

314
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,366
NO.

315
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,868
ALL RIGHT. HANG ON.

316
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,876
PASS THE CHEESE, PLEASE.

317
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,879

318
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,383
MY GOD, YOU CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT ME, CAN YOU?

319
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,885
NOPE.

320
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,887
HEY, IT'S PHOEBE!

321
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,889
WE CAN TALK TO PHOEBE!

322
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,893
NO. I'M TOO DEPRESSED TO TALK.

323
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,395
I'LL GIVE YOU $1,000 TO TALK TO US.

324
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,898
HEY, YOU GUYS, WHAT DO YOU THINK

325
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,901
ABOUT MAKING THAT BEACH TRIP AN ANNUAL THING?

326
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,903
NO! NO! NO!

327
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,905
ALL RIGHT, WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE?

328
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,406
WHAT?

329
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,407
WE TOOK A WALK.

330
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,408
NOTHING HAPPENED.

331
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,411
I CAME BACK WITH NOTHING ALL OVER ME.

332
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,412
COME ON.

333
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,414
COME ON, WHAT HAPPENED? JOEY?

334
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,917
ALL RIGHT. NO!

335
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,919
JOEY, WE SWORE WE'D NEVER TELL.

336
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,921
THEY'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND.

337
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,425
WELL, WE HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING.

338
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:27,927
WE HAVE TO GET IT OUT.

339
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,428
IT'S EATING ME ALIVE!

340
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,433
MONICA GOT STUNG BY A JELLYFISH.

341
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,434
ALL RIGHT!

342
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,940
ALL RIGHT.

343
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,944
I GOT STUNG.

344
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,447
STUNG BAD.

345
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,450
I COULDN'T STAND.

346
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,453
I... I COULDN'T WALK.

347
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,957
WE WERE TWO MILES FROM THE HOUSE.

348
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,960
WE WERE SCARED AND ALONE.

349
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,462
WE DIDN'T THINK WE COULD MAKE IT.

350
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,468
I WAS IN TOO MUCH PAIN.

351
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,971
AND I WAS TIRED FROM DIGGING THE HUGE HOLE.

352
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,476
AND THEN JOEY REMEMBERED SOMETHING.

353
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,479
I'D SEEN THIS THING ON THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL.

354
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,480
WAIT A MINUTE.

355
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,481
I SAW THAT.

356
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,983
ON THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL.

357
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,986
YEAH, ABOUT JELLYFISH, AND HOW IF YOU...

358
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,990
EWW!

359
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,992
YOU PEED ON YOURSELF?

360
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,994
EWW! EWW!

361
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,495
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT!

362
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,997
YOU DON'T KNOW!

363
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,500
I MEAN, I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO PASS OUT FROM THE PAIN.

364
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,002
ANYWAY, I TRIED. ..

365
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:47,006
BUT I COULDN'T... BEND THAT WAY.

366
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,009
SO...

367
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,513
EWW! EWW! EWW!

368
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,019
THAT'S RIGHT. I STEPPED UP!

369
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,023
SHE'S MY FRIEND, AND SHE NEEDED HELP.

370
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,027
IF I HAD TO, I'D PEE ON ANY ONE OF YOU.

371
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,533
ONLY, UH...

372
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,534
I COULDN'T.

373
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,040
I GOT THE STAGE FRIGHT.

374
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,541
I WANTED TO HELP

375
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,044
BUT THERE WAS JUST TOO MUCH PRESSURE

376
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,047
SO... SO I, UH... I TURNED TO CHANDLER.

377
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,548

378
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,552
JOEY KEPT SCREAMING AT ME

379
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,554
"DO IT NOW! DO IT! DO IT!

380
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,056
DO IT NOW!"

381
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,058
SOMETIMES, LATE AT NIGHT

382
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,060
I CAN STILL HEAR THE SCREAMING.

383
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,563

384
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,065
THAT'S BECAUSE SOMETIMES

385
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,567
I JUST DO IT THROUGH MY WALL TO FREAK YOU OUT.

386
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,570
MAYBE THERE'S SOMEBODY THAT YOU GUYS COULD TO.

387
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,572
UP NO. WHO? IT'S NOT LIKE THEY HAVE A GRO

388
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,074
.
FOR PEOPLE LIKE US

389
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,078
YEAH, NO, THERE'S THIS GUY OWEN.

390
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,579
HE'S THE BEST.

391
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,081
I MIGHT HAVE HIS CARD.

392
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,587
??
 ?? ...AND FUCHSIA AND MAUVE

393
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:13,092
?? THOSE ARE THE 66 COLORS OF MY BEDROOM. ??

394
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,593

395
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,594
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

396
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,596
OH, AND I INVITE ALL OF YOU

397
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,599
TO COUNT THE COLORS IN YOUR BEDROOM.

398
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,101
EXCEPT FOR YOU.

399
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,602
YOU GO AWAY.

400
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,108
I'LL GO IN A SECOND.

401
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,609
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU

402
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,611
THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN A DAY

403
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,115
WHEN I DIDN'T REGRET GIVING YOU UP.

404
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,117
OKAY. BYE.

405
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,618
NO. I'M NOT DONE.

406
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,120
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

407
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,123
THAT THE REASON I NEVER LOOKED YOU UP WAS BECAUSE...

408
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,625
WELL, I WAS AFRAID THAT YOU WOULD REACT...

409
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,629
JUST, WELL, LIKE THE WAY YOU'RE REACTING RIGHT NOW

410
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,630
AND... CAN'T WE JUST

411
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,133
YOU KNOW, START FROM HERE, PLEASE?

412
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,635
NO.

413
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,641
OKAY.

414
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,143
SORRY.

415
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,147
BUT JUST ONE LAST THING.

416
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,650
YOU KNOW, YOU CAME LOOKING FOR FAMILY.

417
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,653
I'M FAMILY.

418
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,654

419
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,156
I'M IT.

420
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,661
WELL, NOW I'M DONE.

421
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,667
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE LOSING ANYTHING, YOU KNOW?

422
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,171
YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

423
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,673
IT'S NOT LIKE WE KNOW EACH OTHER OR ANYTHING

424
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,675
OR THAT WE HAVE ANYTHING IN COMMON.

425
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,676
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

426
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,178
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE

427
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,180
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN COMMON.

428
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,684
I MEAN, I LIKE PIZZA.

429
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,187
I...I LIKE PIZZA.

430
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,688
YOU DO? HA!

431
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,691
WAIT, I LIKE, UM, THE BEATLES.

432
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,693
OH, MY GOD, SO DO I!

433
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,194
OH, I KNEW IT!

434
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,195
WOW!

435
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,196
WAIT WAIT WAIT.

436
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,697
PUPPIES-- CUTE OR UGLY?

437
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,698
OH, SO CUTE.

438
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,699
UH HUH! WELL?

439
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,702
YOU SEE?

440
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,705
BUT I'M STILL... I'M MAD AT YOU.

441
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,706
I KNOW.

442
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,710
I'M MAD AT ME, TOO.

443
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,713
WELL, UM, DO YOU WANT TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT?

444
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,216
BECAUSE I'M KIND OF HUNGRY.

445
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,218
HEY! ME, TOO!

446
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,720
OH, UNCANNY.

447
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,722
GOD, LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO RAIN

448
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,724
AND I DON'T HAVE MY UMBRELLA

449
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,726
ME, NEITHER. I REALLY HATE THAT.

450
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,229
ALL RIGHT, STOP IT. NOW YOU'RE JUST DOING IT

451
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,231
TO FREAK ME OUT.

452
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,735

453
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,238
OH, I MISSED YOU.

454
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,240
I MISSED YOU, TOO.

455
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,745
OH, I WAS SO NERVOUS ABOUT THAT LETTER.

456
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,251
BUT THE WAY YOU OWNED UP TO EVERYTHING

457
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,752
IT JUST... SHOWED ME

458
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,755
HOW MUCH YOU'VE GROWN, YOU KNOW?

459
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,759
I SUPPOSE.

460
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,762
.
NO, YOUHAVE, ROSS, YOU HAVE

461
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,764
YOU SHOULD GIVE YOURSELF CREDIT.

462
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,268
 I MEAN, MY MOM NEVER THOUGHT  THIS WOULD WORK OUT.

463
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,769

464
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,772
SHE WAS ALL, "ONCE A CHEATER, ALWAYS A CHEATER."

465
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,276
MM HMM.

466
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,280
OH... I JUST WISH WE HADN'T LOST THOSE FOUR MONTHS.

467
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,782
BUT IF TIME WAS WHAT YOU NEEDED

468
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:28,787
JUST TO GAIN A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE...

469
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,290
 WE WERE ON A BREAK!

470
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,292
COFFEE HOUSE?

471
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,793
YOU BET.

472
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,796
AND FOR THE RECORD, IT TOOK TWO PEOPLE

473
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,798
TO BREAK UP THIS RELATIONSHIP.

474
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,800
YOU AND THAT GIRL FROM THE COPY PLACE

475
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,303
WHICH, YESTERDAY, YOU TOOK FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR.

476
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,806
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR, OKAY?

477
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,308
I DIDN'T FINISH THE WHOLE LETTER.

478
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,309
WHAT?

479
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,810
I FELL ASLEEP.

480
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,813
YOU FELL ASLEEP?

481
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,316
IT WAS 5:30 IN THE MORNING

482
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:02,321
AND YOU HAD RAMBLED ON FOR 18 PAGES...

483
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,325
FRONT AND BACK!

484
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,826

485
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,328
OH OH OH, AND BY THE WAY

486
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,830
Y O U APOSTROPHE R E

487
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,332
MEANS "YOU ARE."

488
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,833
Y O U R MEANS "YOUR."

489
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,835
HA! YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE

490
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,338
I EVEN THOUGHT OF GETTING BACK TOGETHER WITH YOU.

491
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,839
WE ARE SO OVER.

492
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,841
OH... OH... OH...

493
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,343
FINE BY ME!

494
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,845
OH, AND HEY, THOSE LITTLE SPELLING TIPS

495
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,846
WILL COME IN HANDY

496
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,848
WHEN YOU'RE AT HOME ON SATURDAY NIGHTS

497
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,850
PLAYING SCRABBLE WITH MONICA!

498
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,352
HEY... SORRY!

499
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,355
I JUST FEEL BAD ABOUT ALL THAT SLEEP YOU'RE GOING TO MISS

500
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,856
WISHING YOU WERE WITH ME.

501
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,859
OH, NO NO NO, DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT ME FALLING ASLEEP.

502
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,862
I STILL HAVE YOUR LETTER!

503
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,865
AND HEY, JUST SO YOU KNOW...

504
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,367
IT'S NOT THAT COMMON

505
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,369
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO EVERY GUY

506
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,871
AND IT IS A BIG DEAL!

507
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,374
I KNEW IT!

508
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,381
GIN.

509
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,882
WE WERE PLAYING GIN?

510
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,885
YOU KNOW, IF WE WERE A COUPLE

511
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,887
WE COULD PLAY THIS GAME NAKED.

512
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,889

513
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,391
WOULD YOU STOP?

514
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,393
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

515
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,394
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

516
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,396
I THINK YOU'RE GREAT.

517
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,399
I THINK YOU'RE SWEET AND YOU'RE SMART

518
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,401
AND I LOVE YOU.

519
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,904
BUT YOU WILL ALWAYS BE THE GUY WHO PEED ON ME.
