1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,006
OKAY, SHE IS THE STAR OF THE PLAY

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,007
AND SHE IS MY GIRLFRIEND.

3
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,508
I GET TO HAVE SEX

4
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,010
WITH THE STAR OF THE PLAY.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,512
PEOPLE CAN HEAR YOU.

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,514
I KNOW!

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,024
WOW, SHE LOOKS GREAT, DOESN'T SHE?

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,026

9
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,527
 HI.

10
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:31,531
THAT IS ONE GOOD LOOKING MAN.

11
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,033
IS IT JUST ME

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,035
OR CAN YOU ACTUALLY SEE HIS ABS

13
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,537
THROUGH HIS OVERCOAT?

14
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:41,541
 SO, YOU BEEN DOING THIS LONG?

15
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,543
 NO, YOU'RE MY FIRST.

16
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,545
PUT THE MONEY ON THE TABLE.

17
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,548

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,051
 OH, YEAH. OOH, THAT'S NICE.

19
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,553

20
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,055
DUDE.

21
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,560
 IS THAT AN EXPENSIVE BLOUSE?

22
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,562
 IF YOU WANT IT TO BE.

23
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,563

24
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,565
 OH!

25
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,569
HERE'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S BUTTON.

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,122
OH, HEY, MON, DO YOU STILL HAVE

40
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,624
YOUR OLD BLOUSES AND DRESSES FROM HIGH SCHOOL?

41
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,627
YEAH. I THINK I HAVE SOME AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. WHY?

42
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,130
IT'S JUST MATERNITY CLOTHES ARE SO EXPENSIVE.

43
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,134
 RACH, I MADE A PILE OF YOUR STUFF

44
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,635
ON THIS SIDE OF THE ROOM.

45
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,636
IF YOU COULD JUST...

46
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,638

47
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,640
THROW YOUR PURSES AT IT.

48
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,643
BLOOMINGDALE'S ELIMINATED MY DEPARTMENT.

49
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,644

50
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,146
GOD! ARE YOU OUT OF A JOB?

51
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,648
NO, BUT THEY STUCK ME IN PERSONAL SHOPPING

52
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,650
WHICH IS JUST A HUGE STEP DOWN.

53
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,652
"PERSONAL SHOPPING"-- WHAT IS THAT?

54
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,155
LIKE, WHERE YOU WALK AROUND WITH SNOOTY RICH PEOPLE

55
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,656
AND TELL THEM WHAT TO BUY?

56
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,657
UH HUH.

57
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,160
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

58
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,662
HEY.

59
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,164
UM... EXCUSE ME.

60
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,665
WE SWITCHED APARTMENTS.

61
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,667
YOU CAN'T EAT OUR FOOD ANYMORE.

62
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,169
THAT GRAVY TRAIN HAS ENDED.

63
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,171
THERE'S GRAVY?

64
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,174
IF YOU HAVE THE BIG APARTMENT

65
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,676
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE COMING OVER ALL THE TIME.

66
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,678
THAT FRIDGE HAS GOT TO BE STOCKED, OKAY?

67
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,181
THAT'S YOUR DEPARTMENT NOW.

68
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,184
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

69
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,186
I THINK I LEFT A DOUGHNUT UP HERE.

70
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,191
HEY.

71
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,192
HEY. HEY.

72
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,694
OH, HOW WAS KATHY'S PLAY?

73
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,197
WELL, KATHY GETS HALF NAKED AND SIMULATES SEX

74
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,200
WITH A REAL GOOD LOOKING GUY.

75
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,703
IT WAS LIKE SOMEBODY LITERALLY WROTE DOWN MY WORST NIGHTMARE

76
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,206
AND THEN CHARGED ME $32 TO SEE IT.

77
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,709
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR A BUSINESS.

78
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,211
I'M TOTALLY SCREWED, OKAY?

79
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,213
THEY'RE GOING TO BE HOT AND HEAVY

80
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,214
ON STAGE EVERY NIGHT

81
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,716
AND THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO THEIR CAST PARTIES

82
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,218
AND HE'LL TRY TO UNDERMINE ME.

83
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,221
"SO, WHERE'S YOUR BOYFRIEND-- WHAT HIS NAME-- CHESTER?"

84
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,722
AND SHE'LL GO, "NO, IT'S CHANDLER."

85
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,224
AND HE'LL GO, "WHATEVER."

86
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,226

87
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,229
THAT THAT IS A GOOD TRICK.

88
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,733
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, LOOK, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

89
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,735
LOOK, THEY'RE THERE TO DO A JOB.

90
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,237
JUST BECAUSE THEY WORK TOGETHER

91
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,738
DOESN'T MEAN THEY'LL GET TOGETHER.

92
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,240
JUST BECAUSE IT HAPPENED

93
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,242
WITH SUSAN SARANDON AND TIM ROBBINS

94
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,743
DOESN'T MEAN IT'LL HAPPEN WITH THEM.

95
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,245
OH, OH...

96
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,248
ALEC BALDWIN AND KIM BASINGER.

97
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,250
OH! TOM CRUISE AND NICOLE KIDMAN.

98
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,252
YEAH.

99
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,753
MEL GIBSON AND CLINT EASTWOOD.

100
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,257
THEY'RE NOT A COUPLE.

101
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,259
OH, OKAY. I GET THE GAME NOW.

102
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,762
ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE IN MOVIES TOGETHER.

103
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,264
IT'S MUCH DIFFERENT WITH PLAYS.

104
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,266
YOU GUYS WERE JUST IN ACTING CLASS TOGETHER

105
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,267
AND SHE SLEPT WITH YOU.

106
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,768
ACTING CLASS IS A LOT MORE

107
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,769
LIKE A MOVIE THAN A PLAY.

108
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,771
OKAY, LOOK.

109
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,273
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION:

110
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,275
WHEN THEY WERE DOING IT ONSTAGE

111
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,276
WAS IT, LIKE, REALLY HOT?

112
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,277
OH, YEAH.

113
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,279
WELL, OKAY

114
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,780
SO THEN YOU'RE FINE.

115
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,781
LOOK, THE RULE IS

116
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,285
WHEN TWO ACTORS ARE ACTUALLY DOING IT OFFSTAGE

117
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,788
THEN ALL THE SEXUAL TENSION BETWEEN THEM IS GONE, OKAY?

118
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,790
SO AS LONG AS IT'S HOT ON STAGE

119
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,292
YOU GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

120
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,294
IT'S WHEN THE HEAT GOES AWAY--

121
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,795
THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.

122
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,797
REALLY?

123
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,300
YOU HAVE BEEN TO EVERY PLAY I'VE BEEN IN.

124
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,302
HAVE I EVER HAD CHEMISTRY?  NO.

125
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,803
NO!

126
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,310
SO, MAN, ARE YOU GOING TO GO SEE THE PLAY

127
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,811
WITH ME TONIGHT?

128
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,313
I DON'T KNOW HOW COMFORTABLE I AM

129
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,814
GOING TO SEE HOW HOT THE SEX IS

130
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,816
BETWEEN SOME GUY AND YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

131
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,318
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT...

132
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,819
NO, NO. OH, I'M THERE.

133
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,323
HEY. HEY, MON.

134
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,324
WANT PANCAKES?

135
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,825
YOU MADE PANCAKES?

136
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,327
YEP. GRAB A PLATE.

137
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,830
NO, NO. STAY RIGHT THERE.

138
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,335
GETTING CLOSER.

139
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,837
OKAY, OKAY, BUT DON'T WORRY

140
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,840
BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE CEREALS, MUFFINS, WAFFLES

141
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,842
AND JAMS, JELL IES AND MARMALADES --

142
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,345
WHICH, I'M FAIRLY CERTAI N, ARE THE SAME THING.

143
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,348
PLEASE EAT, BECAUSE JOEY OPENED EVERYTHING.

144
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,350
LISTEN, ALSO, WE'RE WATCHING

145
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,853
THE GAME HERE SATURDAY NIGHT IF PEOPLE WANT TO COME OVER.

146
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,355
OH, YEAH.

147
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,357
I WAS THINKING ABOUT HAVING PEOPLE OVER.

148
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,359
OH, YEAH? WHO'S PLAYING?

149
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,862
THE PLAYERS.

150
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,366
SOMEBODY SEEMS TO BE MISSING

151
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,368
BEING THE HOSTESS.

152
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,869
PLEASE.

153
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,871
IT'S A RELIEF, IS WHAT IT IS

154
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,874
IS WHAT IT IS.

155
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,377
PHEEBS, STICK OUT YOUR PLATE.

156
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,385
MONICA, I'M QUITTING.

157
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,388
I JUST HELPED AN 81 YEAR OLD WOMAN PUT ON A THONG

158
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,889
AND SHE DIDN'T EVEN BUY IT.

159
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,391
I'M TELLING YOU, I'M QUITTING.

160
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,892
THAT'S IT.

161
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,394
I'M TALKING TO MY BOSS RIGHT NOW.

162
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,895
YES, I AM.

163
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,897
YES, I AM. YES, I AM. YES, I AM. YES, I AM.

164
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,399
CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THIS MESSAGE.

165
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,401
OH, MR. WALTHAM.

166
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,903
I, UH... REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

167
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,904
IN A MOMENT, PLEASE.

168
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,406
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A TASK

169
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,408
AND YOU HAVE A CUSTOMER.

170
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,912
HI.

171
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,414
HI. I'M JOSHUA.

172
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,415
HI. I'M RACHEL GREEN.

173
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,916
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, JOSHUA?

174
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,419
WELL, I NEED A WHOLE NEW WARDROBE.

175
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,422
MY WIFE... WELL, MY EX WIFE...

176
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,924
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

177
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,431
ANYWAY, SHE BURNED ALL OF MY CLOTHES.

178
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,933
I GOT AWAY WITH TWO THINGS-- THIS SUIT

179
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,936
AND WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE A SKIRT.

180
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,939
WELL, AT LEAST THAT'S A GREAT SUIT.

181
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,941
BUT IT WASN'T MUCH FUN DROPPING IT OFF

182
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,943
AT THE DRY CLEANERS IN THE SKIRT.

183
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,447
I NEED EVERYTHING DOWN TO UNDERWEAR

184
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,448
SO IF YOU'RE WILLING

185
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,450
I'M, UH... I'M ALL YOURS.

186
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,952
OKAY.

187
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,954
RACHEL, YOU NEEDED TO SPEAK TO ME?

188
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,957
NO, NO, THAT WASN'T ME.

189
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,459
WELL...

190
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,960
WE SHOULD GET STARTED.

191
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,462
LET ME SHOW YOU MY UNDERWEAR--

192
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,467
THE SELECTION OF UNDERWEAR THAT WE CARRY.

193
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,472
OH, IT'S THIS WAY.

194
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,473
IT'S THIS WAY.

195
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,474
IT'S THIS WAY?

196
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,975
YEAH. SORRY.

197
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,477

198
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,481
I'M RIGHT, RIGHT?

199
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,483
THERE WAS, LIKE, NO CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THEM.

200
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,984
BEFORE, THEY HAD HEAT.

201
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:05,985
NOW THERE'S NO HEAT.

202
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,987
NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS.

203
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,490
JOEY TOLD US WHAT THIS MEANS.

204
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,992
ALL RIGHT, LET'S NOT JUMP TO ANY CONCLUSIONS.

205
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,495
THERE WAS SOME SEXUAL CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THEM.

206
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,997
COME ON, IT WAS LIKE COUSINS HAVING SEX.

207
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,000
HERE SHE COMES.

208
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,002
DON'T SAY A WORD. JUST BE COOL.

209
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,004

210
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,007
HEY, YOU GUYS.

00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,012
DID YOU LIKE IT?

214
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,013
ABSOLUTELY.

215
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,515
MM HMM. WASN'T NICK FUNNY

216
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,017

217
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,020

218
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,024
IT'S A GOOD PLAY, ISN'T IT?

219
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,025
MMM.

220
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,027
I LOVED THE PLAY.

221
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,529
UH... YEAH, YOU WERE GREAT

222
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,031

00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,046
CLEARLY, I'M HAVING SEX WITH HIM?

226
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,047
IT WAS SO OBVIOUS.

227
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,549
THERE WAS NO CHEMISTRY BETWEEN YOU.

228
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,051
OKAY, LET ME JUST GET THIS STRAIGHT:

229
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,053
YOU'RE ACCUSING ME OF CHEATING ON YOU

230
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,556
AND YOU'RE INSULTING MY PERFORMANCE?

231
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,057
I CAN SEE HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN.

232
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,059
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE UP THERE EVERY NIGHT

233
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,561
NAKED, TOUCHING, KISSING.

234
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,062
ACTING.

235
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,064
CHANDLER, THIS IS MY JOB.

236
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,066
I I'M PLAYING A PART IN A PLAY.

237
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,568
HOW CAN YOU NOT TRUST ME?

238
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,071
WELL, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND, GIVEN HOW WE STARTED.

239
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,573
OH, WOW.

240
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,075
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE THROWING THAT IN MY FACE.

241
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,076
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED

242
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,078
AND I DON'T EVEN SEE YOU DENYING THIS.

243
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,080
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, CHANDLER.

244
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,082
WHY DON'T YOU CALL ME WHEN YOU GROW UP?

245
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,584
YEAH, WELL

246
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,086
DON'T EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN ANYTIME SOON.

247
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,594
OH! I HAVE THE BEST JOB IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.

248
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,095
THE MOST ADORABLE GUY CAME OVER TODAY

249
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,099

00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,602
RACHEL HAS A NEW DOLL.

251
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,603
OH, I WISH HE WAS A DOLL.

252
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,605
THEN I COULD GET A "RACHEL" DOLL

253
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,107

WHAT? WHAT?

272
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,160
NOTHING. JUST SOMETHING JOSHUA SAID ABOUT V NECKS

273
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,663
BUT YOU HAD TO BE THERE.

274
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,165

00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,675
WELL, HATE TO EAT AND RUN.

00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,176
NO, WAIT. PLEASE DON'T GO.

280
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,679
I'VE GOT PORN FOR YOU, TOO.

281
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,681
ME, I DON'T NEED IT.

282
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,184
PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO WANT TO HANG OUT HERE.

283
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,687
WHY? HONEY, WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?

284
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,690
I'M THE HOSTESS, NOT THOSE GUYS.

285
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,692
I'M ALWAYS THE HOSTESS.

286
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,694
I MEAN, EVEN WHEN I WAS LITTLE, I MEAN THE...

287
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,196
THE GIRLS BROUGHT THEIR DOLLIES TO MY TEA PARTY.

288
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,698
I SERVED THE BEST AIR.

289
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,199
WELL, WHY DID YOU

290
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,701

291
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,703
OUT OF, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE HAS TO HANG OUT

292
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,704
IN THE BIG APARTMENT?

293
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,706
BECAUSE THEY TOOK OUR APARTMENT.

294
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,207
I WANTED TO PUNISH THEM.

295
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,208
I'M I'M DONE NOW.

296
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,210
THEY THEY THEY'VE SUFFERED ENOUGH.

297
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,712
BUT IF YOU WANTED TO PUNISH THEM

298
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,214
YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST MADE THEM HANG OUT HERE.

299
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,216
ALL RIGHT THEN, WHEN I'M FINISHED

300
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,217
WITH THIS PLACE

301
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,219
IT'S GOING TO BE TEN TIMES BETTER

302
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,721
THAN THAT PLACE.

303
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,722
OH, ARE WE GOING

304
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,223
TO TRASH THEIR PLACE?

305
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,725
STEPS!

306
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,729
SLUT!

307
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,735
YOU WILL ALL BE VERY HAPPY TO HEAR

308
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,738
THAT KATHY IS SLEEPING WITH THAT GUY.

309
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,239
OH, GOD. OH, NO. WHAT?

310
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,240
SO, YOU WERE RIGHT?

311
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,244
I CONFRONTED HER, AND SHE DIDN'T DENY IT.

312
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,747
I DON'T LIVE HERE.

313
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,250
CHANDLER...

314
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,252
 CHANDLER, WHAT DID SHE SAY?

315
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,754
WAIT A MINUTE. ARE YOU SURE?

316
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,756
I MAY BE DRUNK, BUT I KNOW WHAT SHE SAID

317
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,259
SO THEN I WENT OVER TO BEEFSTEAK CHULIE'S...

318
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,762
BEEFSTEAK CHARLIE'S?

319
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,263
YES!

320
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,265
SEE, YOU AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN, LIKE...

321
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,268
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

322
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,770
OH, MAN, I AM SO SORRY.

323
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,272
THE BARTENDER TAUGHT ME A TRICK, THOUGH.

324
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,282
I DON'T REMEMBER IT.

325
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,297
WHOOPS.

326
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,299
OH, HEY, DO YOU

327
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,300
NEED HELP WITH THAT?

328
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,301
NO.

329
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,803
I GOT IT.

330
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,804
OH, I JUST FEEL BAD.

331
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,305
I NEVER VACUUM.

332
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,808
HEY.

333
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,809
HEY. HEY.

334
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,812
SO, I WAS WITH JOSHUA FOR AN HOUR TODAY

335
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,314
AND HE HAS NOT ASKED ME OUT.

336
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,816
JUST SO FRUSTRATING.

337
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,317
WHY DON'T  YOU ASK HIM OUT?

338
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,319
OH, YEAH. TOTALLY. THAT'S SUCH A TURN ON.

339
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,821
REALLY?

340
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,322
IT DOESN'T SEEM DESPERATE?

341
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,324
THAT'S THE TURN ON.

342
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,326
hE JUST GOT A DIVORCE, RIGHT?

343
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,828
SO HE'S PROBABLY REALLY NERVOUS

344
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,329
AROUND WOMEN, YOU KNOW?

345
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,832
MAYBE YOU JUST NEED TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE.

346
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,333
I'VE NEVER ASKED A GUY OUT BEFORE.

347
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,836
YOU'VE NEVER ASKED A GUY OUT?

348
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:57,837
NO. HAVE YOU?

349
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,339
THOUSANDS OF TIMES.

350
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,844
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME SOUND TOO GOOD, DOES IT?

351
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,346
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW I WOULD GO ABOUT IT.

352
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,349
OH, WELL, WHAT I DO IS, UH... I LOOK A WOMAN UP AND DOWN

353
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,354

HEY... HOW YOU DOING?

I'M GOING TO DO THAT.

357
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,370
I'M GOING TO CALL HIM UP AND I'M GOING TO ASK HIM OUT.

358
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,373
I CAN DO THAT... ASK HIM OUT.

359
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,375

YOU'VE DONE THAT A THOUSAND TIMES?

375
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,925
I'VE NEVER DONE THAT.

376
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,928
OH, GOD. I JUST GOT SO NERVOUS THAT HE WAS GOING TO SAY NO.

377
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,931
WELL, YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE HIM SOMETHING HE CAN'T SAY NO TO

378
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,932
LIKE, UH, KNICKS TICKETS.

379
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,934
INVITE THE GUY TO A KNICKS GAME.

380
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,435
YOU'RE GUARANTEED HE'LL SAY YES.

381
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,436
THAT WILL WORK?

382
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,939
ABSOLUTELY. IF IT DOESN'T

383
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,940
CAN I GET THE EXTRA TICKET?

384
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,441

385
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,443
WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?

386
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,958
DID SHE CALL?

387
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,961
NO. SORRY.

388
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,963
WELL, MAY... MAYBE I SHOULD CALL HER.

389
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,464
 FORGET HER, MAN.

390
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,967
YOU DON'T NEED HER. YOU DON'T NEED THAT.

391
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,469
HE'S RIGHT. WHAT SHE DID WAS UNFORGIVABLE.

392
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,973
WELL, YEAH, BUT... YOU KNOW, WHAT WHAT IF I WAS WRONG?

393
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,474
HOW MIGHT YOU BE WRONG?

394
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,976
WELL, YOU KNOW, WHAT IF SHE

395
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,978
DIDN'T ACTUALLY SLEEP WITH THE GUY?

396
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,980
TELL ME SHE ACTUALLY TOLD YOU.

397
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,481
SHE DID NOT HAVE TO TELL ME.

398
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,983
I SAW THE PLAY, AND THERE WAS NO HEAT.

399
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:24,984
BACK ME UP, ROSS.

400
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,485
THAT'S ALL YOU'RE

401
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,486
BASING THIS ON?

402
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,487
THAT'S NOT BACKING ME UP!

403
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,990
YOU SAID WITH THE OFFSTAGE AND THE HEAT

404
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,991
AND THE ON STAGE AND HEAT...

405
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,493
WHOA WHOA! THAT WAS JUST A THEORY.

406
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,996
THERE'S A LOT OF THEORIES THAT DIDN'T PAN OUT...

407
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:42,001
LONE GUNMAN... COMMUNISM... GEOMETRY.

408
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,003
OH, MY GOD!

409
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,509
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TO A BASKETBALL GAME WITH...

410
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,511
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY... BASKETBALL

411
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,014
BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO HAVE TICKETS TO THE...

412
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,016
OKAY... UM...

413
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,020
WHO LIKES THE KNICKS?

414
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,523
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

415
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,028
OH... WELL, AS A SINGLE WOMAN...

416
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,030
WHO IS AVAILABLE

417
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,532
I THINK YOU LOOK GREAT.

418
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,034
HUH... YEAH?

419
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,537
YEP. OH, YEAH. YOU LOOK GREAT.

420
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,545
OH, YEAH. YEAH, THIS LOOKS GREAT.

421
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,048
UM, SO, YOU LIKE IT?

422
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,549
I DO. I DO. I LOVE IT.

423
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,052
IN FACT, I I THINK I'M GOING TO WEAR IT HOME.

424
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,053
GREAT.

425
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,055
ALL RIGHT. WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH...

426
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,057
OH... SURE. FOR ALL YOUR HELP.

427
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,059
WELL, I GUESS, UH, I GUESS THIS IS IT.

428
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,560
YEEAAH!

429
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,561
THANKS.

430
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,563
MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU IN THE SPRING

431
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,564
UH, FOR THE BATHING SUITS.

432
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,066
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT NOW?!

433
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,068
OH, THAT'S OKAY... I...

434
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,069
OH...

435
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,571
ANYWAY, HOPEFULLY I I'LL SEE YOU AROUND SOMETIME.

436
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,573
BASKETBALL!

437
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,576
SORRY?

438
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:01,080
I, UH... I HAVE TWO TICKETS TO THE KNICKS GAME TONIGHT

439
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,581
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED...

440
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,085
JUST AS A THANK YOU FOR THIS WEEK.

441
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,088
WOW! THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

442
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,089
REALLY?

443
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,091
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC.

444
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,092
OH...

445
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,594
MY NEPHEW IS CRAZY ABOUT THE KNICKS.

446
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,596
THIS IS FANTASTIC.

447
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,597
THANK YOU

448
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,598
SO MUCH, RACHEL.

449
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:20,599
GOOD MORNING.

450
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,101
HI.

451
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,109
HEY.

452
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,112
HEY... I JUST... I JUST WANTED TO COME OVER

453
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,114
TO... TO SAY THAT I'M SORRY, YOU KNOW.

454
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,617
I KNOW... I ACTED LIKE THE BIGGEST IDIOT IN THE WORLD

455
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,620
AND I CAN COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WERE SO UPSET.

456
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,622
OH, WOW.

457
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,125
I REALLY WISH YOU'D CALLED ME.

458
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,127
YEAH, I KNOW. I WISH I HAD, TOO

459
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,629
BUT, YOU KNOW, I I THINK THIS IS A GOOD THING, YOU KNOW

460
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:51,630
BECAUSE WE'VE HAD

461
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:52,631
OUR FIRST FIGHT

462
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,633
AND NOW WE CAN MOVE ON.

463
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,634
YOU KNOW, I MEAN

464
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,136
I KNOW FOR ME...

465
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,145
NICK'S PANTS?

466
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,146
YEAH.

467
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,647
YEAH.

468
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,648
WELL...

469
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:14,153
I THINK OUR SECOND FIGHT IS GOING TO BE A BIG ONE.

470
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:19,658
 OKAY...

471
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,161
FOR NEXT TIME, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

472
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,662
I HAVE AN EXTRA TICKET--

473
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,664
AN EXTRA TICKET-- NOT TWO TICKETS.

474
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,166
I HAVE AN EXTRA TICKET.

475
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,168
RIGHT.

476
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,170
SO, THE FIRST TIME YOU ASKED A GUY OUT

477
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,172
HE HE TURNED YOU DOWN?

478
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,675
HE DIDN'T TURN ME DOWN.

479
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,177
HE'S AT THE GAME, ISN'T HE?

480
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,179
I GOT THE DATE-- I'M JUST NOT ON IT.

481
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,685
OKAY... IT'S READY.

482
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,187
COME ON.

483
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,688
WHAT'S READY?

484
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,689
JUST COME.

485
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,695
OH, MY GOD...

486
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:57,696
WOW!

487
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:58,697
HEY...

488
00:19:59,198 --> 00:19:59,698
MONICA...

489
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,200
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

490
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,703
OH, DID YOU WHAT, DID YOU WORK FOR TWO DAYS STRAIGHT?

491
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,205
PRETTY MUCH.

492
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,708
SO, WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE FLOOR?

493
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,211
I DON'T KNOW. LOOKS THE SAME.

494
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,213
YOU USED TO HAVE CARPET.

495
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,215
OH, YEAH.

496
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,217
SO, I I MADE SNACKS.

497
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,218
OH.

498
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,719
PLEASE, JUST HANG OUT, OKAY.

499
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,723
I I'M JUST GOING TO REST MY EYES FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT.

500
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,226
MON, DO YOU WANT US TO, UH, COME BACK LATER?

501
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,228
OH, NO, NO, NO. STAY, STAY, STAY.

502
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,230
JUST KEEP TALKING.

503
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,233
I AM ALWAYS THE HOSTESS.

504
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,736
HEY.

505
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,737
HOW DID IT GO?

506
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,739
WELL, SHE WASN'T SLEEPING WITH HIM.

507
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,740
OH, GOOD.

508
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,242
SHE IS NOW.

509
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,246
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

510
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,749
I'M SAYING THAT SHE IS A DEVIL WOMAN.

511
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,252
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, YOU THINK YOU KNOW A PERSON.

512
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,754
THEN THEY TURN AROUND, THEY SLEEP WITH NICK.

513
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,258
NICK AND HIS ROCK HARD PECS AND HIS GIANT MAN NIPPLES.

514
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,763
I HATE HIM... AND I HATE HER.

515
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,766
WELL, I DON'T HATE HER. I LOVE HER.

516
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,268
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT, REALLY.

517
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,270
HOW? HOW IS IT YOUR FAULT?

518
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,773
BECAUSE... AAH! I... I SHOULD HAVE CALLED.

519
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,775
YOU KNOW, IF I HAD JUST CALLED HER

520
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,277
AFTER OUR BIG, STUPID FIGHT

521
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,279
SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE GONE OUT WITH NICK

522
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,781
AND THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ENDED UP IN BED TOGETHER.

523
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,782
I THREW HER

524
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,284
AT HIS MAN NIPPLES.

525
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,286
HONEY, THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

526
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,288
JUST BECAUSE YOU GUYS HAD A FIGHT

527
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,790
DOES NOT JUSTIFY HER SLEEPING WITH SOMEONE.

528
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,296
WELL, IF IF SHE THOUGHT THEY WERE ON A BREAK...

529
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,304
ONE OF YOUR CUSTOMERS SEEMS

530
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,307
TO HAVE LEFT HIS BILLFOLD-- A JOSHUA BURGIN.

531
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,808
REALLY?

532
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,310
WILL YOU CALL HIM?

533
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,812
YES. I WILL, ABSOLUTELY.

534
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,828
HELLO, RACHEL.

535
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,830
HI, JOSHUA.

536
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,333
I LEFT MY WALLET HERE ON PURPOSE.

537
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,834
REALLY?

538
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,337
YES. I JUST WANTED TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

539
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,839
OH, I'M GLAD.

540
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,842
RACHEL, I'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING TO YOU.

541
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,844
YES?

542
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,347
HOW YOU DOING?
