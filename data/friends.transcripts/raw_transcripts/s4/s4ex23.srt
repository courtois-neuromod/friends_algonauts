1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,002
YOU GUYS, HURRY UP.

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,003
THE FLIGHT LEAVES IN FOUR HOURS.

3
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,005
IT COULD TAKE TIME TO GET A TAXI.

4
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,506
THERE COULD BE TRAFFIC.

5
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,008
THE PLANE COULD LEAVE EARLY.

6
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,010
WHEN WE GET TO LONDON, THERE COULD BE A LINE AT CUSTOMS.

7
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,511
COME ON!

8
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,013
SIX HOUR TRIP TO LONDON.

9
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,514
THAT'S A LOT OF MONICA.

10
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,516
WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE?

11
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,020
CONDOMS, DUDE.

12
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,024
WELL, HOW COME THE WRITING IS IN SPANISH?

13
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,526
DON'T READ MY CONDOMS.

14
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,529
PASSPORT. CHECK.

15
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,031
CAMERA. CHECK.

16
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,532
TRAVELER'S CHECKS. CHECK.

17
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,034
WHO ARE YOU SAYING CHECK TO?

18
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,535
MYSELF.

19
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,538
YOU KNOW, FOR REMEMBERING TO PACK THE THING.

20
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,541
YOU KNOW, YOU DO A GOOD THING, YOU GET A CHECK.

21
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,043
MY MOM DOES IT.

22
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,045
I NEVER REALIZED IT WAS WEIRD.

23
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:49,049
HEY, MY MOM USED TO PUT HER HEAD IN THE OVEN.

24
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,051
ACTUALLY, SHE ONLY DID IT THE ONE TIME

25
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,552
BUT IT WAS PRETTY WEIRD.

26
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,555
HEY.

27
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,556
HEY.

28
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,557
ARE YOU READY YET?

29
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:58,558
YEP. YOU GOT THE TICKETS?

30
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,560
OH, GOT THEM RIGHT HERE. CHECK.

31
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,564
IT'S ALL LONDON, BABY.

32
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,066
HERE WE GO.

33
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,569
YOU GOT YOUR PASSPORT?

34
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,072
YEAH. IN MY THIRD DRAWER IN MY DRESSER.

35
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,074
YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT.

36
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,578
OH!

37
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,580
THERE IT IS.

50
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,132
OKAY, IF YOU NEED THE VACUUM

51
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,634
IT'S IN MY CLOSET ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE, OKAY?

52
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,137
THE GARBAGE BAGS ARE NEXT TO THE REFRIGERATOR.

53
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,139
OKAY, OKAY, BUT RACHEL'S GOING TO BE HERE, TOO.

54
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,140
CAN'T I JUST ASK HER THIS STUFF?

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,143
YEAH, OKAY, GIVE THAT A TRY.

56
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,645
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

57
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:26,646
YEAH, CHEERIO.

58
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,148
LONDON, BABY.

59
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,650
OKAY, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT GOING TO GET ANNOYING.

60
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,651
LONDON, BABY!

61
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,655
YOU KNOW WHAT? I WAS WRONG.

62
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,157
WELL, WE'RE ALL HERE.

63
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,658
I GUESS WE SHOULD GET GOING.

64
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,161
OH, I WANT TO COME OVER THERE AND GIVE YOU A HUG

65
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,662

66
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,663

OH, AND GREAT, YOU MIG HT AS WELL BRING ME MY BOOK.

00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,179
IT'S ON THE COUNTER IN YOUR APARTMENT.

76
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,180
OH.

77
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,184

THANKS.

80
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,689
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE THERE.

81
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,191
OH, I KNOW.

82
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,193
SO, SO, SO COME. WHY DON'T YOU COME?

00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,695
COME TO LONDON, PLEASE.

85
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,197
IT WOULD MEAN SO MUCH TO ME.

YEAH, I GOT TO WORK.

87
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,699

00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,209

00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,742
OH, DO YOU NEED A HUG?

111
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,746
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRING ME ANYTHING.

112
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,751
?? LONDON CALLING ??

113
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,253
?? YES, I WAS THERE, TOO ??

114
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,255
?? AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAID? ??

115
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,257
?? WELL, SOME OF IT WAS TRUE ??

116
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,259
?? LONDON CALLING. ??

117
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,265
ALL RIGHT, CHANDLER, DO SOMETHING.

118
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,267
COME ON, DO SOMETHING.

119
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,269
I AM. I'M IGNORING YOU.

120
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,770
OKAY, HERE.

121
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,772
I'M GOING TO BE THE ON CAMERA GUY.

122
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,775
ALL RIGHT, FIRST STOP:

123
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,278
WESTMINSTER ABBEY.

124
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,280
OH, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

125
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,281
THAT'S LONDON, BABY.

126
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,784
ALL RIGHT, THE HOTEL'S HERE.

127
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,785
WAIT.

128
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,287
NO. WE WANT TO GO...

129
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,291
NO.

130
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,792
I KNOW.

131
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:56,296
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO INTO THE MAP.

132
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,802
OKAY, IF YOU SEE A LITTLE VERSION OF ME IN THERE

133
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,304
KILL IT.

134
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,305
I GOT IT.

135
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,807
HERE WE GO.

136
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,810
OKAY, LISTEN, LISTEN.

137
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,812
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO WALK THIS WAY

138
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,314
THE ENTIRE TIME, ARE WE?

139
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,815
SHH.

140
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,817
OH, MAN, YOU MADE ME LOSE IT.

141
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,326
AND THAT WAS ALL BEFORE 10.

142
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,329
THE CATERER RANG TO SAY IT'S GOING TO BE CHICKEN KIEV

143
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,830
INSTEAD OF CHICKEN TARRAGON.

144
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,832
AND THEN THE FLORIST PHONED TO SAY

145
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,334
THAT THERE AREN'T ANY TULIPS.

146
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,836
OH, AND THEN THE CELLIST HAS CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME.

147
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,339
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. EMILY, HONEY, OKAY.

148
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,841
WELL, UP YOURS, TOO.

149
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,843
WHAT?

150
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,845
OH... THAT'S NOT WHAT IT MEANS?

151
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,347
NO, NO. THAT'S TIME OUT.

152
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,348
SORRY.

153
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,849
SWEETIE, YOU GOT TO RELAX.

154
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,851
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE GREAT, OKAY?

155
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,354
COME ON, COME ON.

156
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,358
CHICKEN KIEV?

157
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,859
MM HMM..

158
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,861
DOESN'T THAT SOUND DELICIOUS AT THE LAST MINUTE?

159
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,862
I KNOW

160
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,364
BUT SOMETHING LIKE SALMON

161
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,866
WOULD BE SO MUCH MORE ELEGANT THAN CHICKEN

162
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,370
AND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE SALMONELLA.

163
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,372
OH, GOD.

164
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,374
BUT, OF COURSE, WITH SALMON

165
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,877
YOU'D HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE CHICKENELLA.

166
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,379
SO I CAN'T WAIT

167
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,381
TO SEE WHERE YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED.

168
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,382
YES, YES.

169
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,383
THIS PLACE IS BEAUTIFUL.

170
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,385
EMILY'S PARENTS GOT MARRIED HERE.

171
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,887
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE TEARING IT DOWN.

172
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,390
IT REALLY IS THE MOST LOVELY BUILDING.

173
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,891
I MEAN, IT'S OVER...

174
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,896
OH, MY GOD.

175
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,399
IT'S NICE.

176
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,400
OH.

177
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,901
OH.

178
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,411
OH. OH, MY GOD.

179
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,412
HOW CAN THIS BE HAPPENING?

180
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,413
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

181
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,414
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

182
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,915
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

183
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,417
HOW IS IT GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT?

184
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,419
UH HUH, I SEE THAT.

185
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,421
OKAY, I TALKED TO  THE GUY WITH THE SHOVEL

186
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,922
AND I FOUND OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

187
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,923
 WHAT?

188
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,426
THEY TORE IT DOWN A FEW DAYS EARLY.

189
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,930

190
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,936
?? ENGLAND SWINGS LIKE A PENDULUM DO ??

191
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,440
?? BOBBIES ON BICYCLES, TWO BY TWO ??

192
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,443
?? WESTMINSTER ABBEY, THE TOWER OF BIG BEN ??

193
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,946
?? THE ROSY RED CHEEKS OF THE LITTLE CHILDREN ??

194
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,949
?? NOW, IF YOU HUFF AND PUFF AND YOU FINALLY SAVE ENOUGH MONEY ??

195
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,453
?? TO TAKE YOUR FAMILY ON A TRIP ACROSS THE SEA ??

196
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,455
?? TAKE A TIP BEFORE YOU TAKE YOUR TRIP ??

197
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,457
?? LET ME TELL YOU WHERE TO GO... ??

198
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,459
?? GO TO ENGLAND ??

199
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,962
?? OH, ENGLAND SWINGS LIKE A PENDULUM DO ??

200
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,965
?? BOBBIES ON BICYCLES, TWO BY TWO ??

201
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,968
?? WESTMINSTER ABBEY, THE TOWER OF BIG BEN ??

202
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,972
?? THE ROSY RED CHEEKS OF THE LITTLE CHILDREN... ??

203
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,974

204
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,978
ALL RIGHT, WESTMINSTER ABBEY.

205
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,481
HANDS DOWN, BEST ABBEY I'VE EVER SEEN.

206
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,483
HEY.

207
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,984
OKAY.

208
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,987
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE ABBEY, CHANDLER?

209
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:08,988
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

210
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,991
THEY'RE THINKING OF CHANGING THE NAME OF THIS PLACE.

211
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,992
REALLY? TO WHAT?

212
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,495
TO PUT THE CAMERA AWAY!

213
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,499
MAN, YOU ARE WESTMINSTERCR ABBY.

214
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,009
DON'T WORRY. YOU'LL FIND SOMEPLACE TO GET MARRIED.

215
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,010
OW!

216
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,011
SORRY.

217
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,514
LUCKY THIS DRESS IS RED.

218
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,519
BUT IF WE CAN'T FIND ANOTHER PLACE...

219
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,521
THEN WE CAN'T HAVE THE WEDDING.

220
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,023
I'VE ORDERED CHICKEN AND SALAD

221
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,525
For 50 AND CAKE FOR 1

222
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,027
WHAT SHOULD BE THE MOST WONDERFUL DAY OF MY LIFE

223
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,029
IS RAPIDLY TURNING INTO JUST SUNDAY

224
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,531
WITH A SPECTACULAR AMOUNT OF FOOD.

225
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,032
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND A PLACE.

226
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,034
BUT, EVEN IF, GOD FORBID, YOU DIDN'T

227
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,036
SO YOU POSTPONE THE WEDDING.

228
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,538
IS THAT REALLY SO BAD?

229
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,540
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.

230
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,041
YOU COULD TAKE ALL THE TIME YOU NEEDED

231
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,543
TO GET EVERYTHING THAT YOU WANT.

232
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,044
YOU COULD HAVE TULIPS.

233
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,546
YOU COULD HAVE SALMON.

234
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,549
MMM... SALMON.

235
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,554
I SUPPOSE IT WOULDN'T BE THE END OF THE WORLD.

236
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,556
OH...

237
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,558
OH, THANK YOU!

238
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,560
LOOK, EITHER WAY, YOU'RE GOING TO GET MARRIED

239
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,561
YOU'RE GOING TO BE HAPPY.

240
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,562
MY MOM'S GOING

241
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,064
TO LIKE YOU BETTER THAN ME.

242
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,567
OH, GOD. SHE'S TOLD YOU THAT ALREADY, DIDN'T SHE?!

243
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,573
OH.

244
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,574
OH, HONEY, DON'T GET UP.

245
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,075
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

246
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,076
NOTHING.

247
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,578
I AM HERE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

248
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,579
WHAT DO YOU NEED? ANYTHING.

249
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,582
OKAY. I HAVE A WEDGIE.

250
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,586
OKAY, THAT IS ALL YOU.

251
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,088
SO...

252
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,090
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR LUNCH?

253
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,092
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

254
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,595
I GUESS WE HAVE TO EAT.

255
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,096
YEAH, I DO.

256
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,599
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

257
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,602
I'M JUST BUMMED THE WAY I LEFT THINGS WITH ROSS.

258
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,605
WISH I DIDN'T LIE TO HIM ABOUT HAVING TO WORK.

259
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,106
SEEMS SO MAD AT ME.

260
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,608
DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF.

261
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,110
IF SOMEONE I WAS STILL IN LOVE WITH WAS GETTING MARRIED...

262
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,612
STILL IN LOVE WITH?

263
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,613
YEAH.

264
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,615
I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH ROSS.

265
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,617
OH.

266
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,621
NO, NO. GOOD.

267
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,623
ME NEITHER.

268
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,625
PHOEBE, I'M NOT GOING TO ROSS'S WEDDING

269
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,627
BECAUSE HE'S MY EX BOYFRIEND

270
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,629
AND THAT WOULD BE REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE.

271
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,132
NOT BECAUSE I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH HIM.

272
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,135
I MEAN, HEY, YOU KNOW, I LIKE ROSS AS MUCH AS THE NEXT GUY.

273
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,638
I MEAN, CLEARLY, I HAVE FEELINGS FOR HIM

274
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,139
BUT FEELINGS DON'T MEAN LOVE.

275
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,141
DO I STILL HAVE LOVING FEELINGS FOR ROSS?

276
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,643
YEAH!

277
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,647
BUT I HAVE CONTINUING FEELINGS OF LOVE

278
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,650
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH HIM.

279
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,652
YOU KNOW, I HAVE SEXUAL FEELINGS FOR HIM

280
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,153
BUT I DO LOVE HIM.

281
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,154

282
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,157
OH, MY GOD.

283
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,659
OH, MY...

284
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,661
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?!

285
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,664
W WE THOUGHT YOU KNEW.

286
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,665
"WE"?

287
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,666
YEAH, WE ALL KNOW.

288
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,167
WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.

289
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,670
YOU ALL KNOW.

290
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,171
DOES ROSS KNOW?

291
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,675
OH, NO. ROSS DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

292
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,677
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T TELL ME!

293
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,178
WELL, BECAUSE WE THOUGHT YOU KNEW.

294
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,680
IT'S SO OBVIOUS.

295
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,683
GOD, IT, IT WOULD BE LIKE, YOU KNOW, TELLING MONICA

296
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,185
"HEY, YOU KNOW, YOU LIKE THINGS CLEAN."

297
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,190
OR, YOU KNOW, "HEY, JOEY, YOU'RE GAY."

298
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,193
WHAT?!

299
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,194
OH, PLEASE.

300
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,196
SHE'S ALWAYS GOT A BROOM IN HER HAND.

301
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,204
HI.

302
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,706
SO, WHAT ARE YOU

303
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,208
FINE GENTLEMEN IN THE MARKET FOR?

304
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,710
WE GOT SCARVES

305
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,211
SOUVENIR POSTCARDS...

306
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,213
CHECK THIS OUT, HUH?

307
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,214
OH, YEAH.

308
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,716
THAT'S THE STUFF.

309
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,217
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

310
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,719
WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE TO BUY

311
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,221
THAT "I'M WITH STUPID" TSHIRT ANYMORE.

312
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,223
WELL, I LIKE IT.

313
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,725
HERE YOU GO.

314
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,727
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, YOU'RE NOT REALLY GOING TO BUY THAT, ARE YOU?

315
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,228
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'VE EMBARRASSED ME ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY?

316
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,730
OH, I EMBARRASS YOU?

317
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,231
HOW CAN I ANSWER THAT

318
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,233
WHEN I'M PRETENDING I DON'T KNOW YOU?

319
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,736
HE'S JUST JEALOUS. YOU'LL FIT RIGHT IN.

320
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,237
ALL LONDONERS WEAR THEM.

321
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,739
OH, REALLY? THEN HOW COME

322
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,241
NO ONE HERE ANYWHERE IS WEARING ONE?

323
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,243
THEY'RE ALL TOURISTS.

324
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,244
YEAH.

325
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,747
LOOK, IF YOU INSIST ON WEARING THAT IN PUBLIC

326
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,750
YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON

327
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,251
ALL BY YOURSELF.

328
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,252
OH, YEAH?

329
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,258
IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME CHOOSE.

330
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,761
BETWEEN YOU AND THE HAT, I CHOOSE THE HAT.

331
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,762
GOOD CHOICE. THANKS.

332
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,263
OKAY, LOOK...

333
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,765
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT, OKAY? I'M OUT OF HERE.

334
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,767
I'M NOT GOING TO BE EMBARRASSED ANYMORE.

335
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,277
HOW YOU DOING?

336
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,279
JOEY TRIBBIANI, AMERICA.

337
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,787
HELLO?

338
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,789
HEY, I JUST SPOKE TO YOUR DAD, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

339
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,290
INK HE SEEMS TO TH

340
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,292
WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIND A NEW PLACE FOR THE WEDDING.

341
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,293
WE DON'T HAVE TO.

342
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,795
WH WH WHAT, YOU FOUND A PLACE?

343
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,797
NO, BUT MONICA AND I WERE TALKING

344
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,300
AND AND I WAS SO UPSET ABOUT THE HALL BEING KNOCKED DOWN

345
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,802
AND SHE SUGGESTED

346
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,305
THAT WE JUST PUT THE WEDDING OFF FOR A BIT.

347
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,810
SHE SAID WHAT?

348
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,311
SHE SAID IF I'M NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY

349
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,313
GETTING MARRIED SOMEWHERE THAT WE CAN FIND IN A DAY

350
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,815
WELL, THEN, WE SHOULD JUST POSTPONE IT.

351
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,817

352
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,318
POSTPONE IT?

353
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,319

354
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,821
EMILY, DO YOU THINK

355
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,824
MONICA REALIZES HOW MUCH OUR PARENTS SPENT

356
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,325
ON THIS WEDDING, HUH?

357
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:50,830
DO YOU THINK MY SISTER'S TEENY, TINY, LITTLE BRAIN COMPREHENDS

358
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,833
THAT PEOPLE TOOK TIME OUT OF THEIR LIVES

359
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,836
TO FLY THOUSANDS OF MILES TO BE HERE, HUH?

360
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,341
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

361
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,843
LOOK, I REALIZE THAT PEOPLE

362
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,344
ARE GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTED...

363
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,846

364
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,348
BUT I'M SURE THEY'LL COME BACK WHEN WE CAN DO IT RIGHT.

365
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,850
WELL, I CAN'T ASK PEOPLE TO DO THAT.

366
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,852
WOULD YOU ASK PEOPLE TO DO THAT?

367
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,353
DON'T YOU POINT

368
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,855
YOUR PANTS AT ME.

369
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,356
WE HAVE NO CHOICE.

370
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,859
ANYWHERE HALF DECENT WILL HAVE BEEN BOOKED MONTHS AGO.

371
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,360
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

372
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,863
THIS IS OUR WEDDING I'M TALKING ABOUT.

373
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,364
THE ONLY THING I UNDERSTAND

374
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,866
IS POSTPONING IT IS NOT AN OPTION.

375
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,868
THIS IS WHEN WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

376
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,870
SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? IT'S NOW OR NEVER?

377
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,871
NO, I'M SAYING IT'S NOW.

378
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,872
OR?

379
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,373
THERE'S NO "OR" IN MINE.

380
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,876
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PANTS?!

381
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,380
IT'S NOT THE PANTS, IT'S YOU WHO'S BACKWARDS.

382
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,883
IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS TO ME

383
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,886
WELL, THEN, PERHAPS  WE SHOULDN'T BE GETTING MARRIED AT ALL.

384
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,888
WH... E EMILY, NO. WAIT.

385
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,889
STOP. EMILY, PLEA...

386
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,390

387
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,899
HEY.

388
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,400
SO, DID SHOPPING

389
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,402
HELP YOU FEEL ANY BETTER ABOUT ROSS?

390
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,404
MANHATTAN DOES NOT HAVE

391
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,405
ENOUGH STORES.

392
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,908
WELL, I THINK I CAN HELP YOU

393
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,409
GET OVER HIM.

394
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,911
YOU CAN?

395
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,913
YEAH. I JUST NEED YOU TO BRING ME

396
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,415
SOME PHOTOS OF ROSS, AND A SMALL PIECE OF CHOCOLATE

397
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,917
AND A GLASS OF TEPID WATER.

398
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,919
OOH, IS THIS ONE OF THOSE THINGS

399
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,921
WHERE YOU THROW A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF

400
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,923
IN A BAG WITH SOME GRAVEYARD DIRT

401
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,425
AND THEN HANG IT FROM A NORTH FACING TREE?

402
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,928
ONLY IF YOU HAVE THE HICCUPS, TOO.

403
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,930
YEAH, THE PICTURES ARE FOR YOU.

404
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,931
THE CHOCOLATE

405
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,432
AND THE WATER'S FOR ME.

406
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,434
I JUST DIDN'T FEEL LIKE GETTING UP.

407
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,437
OKAY, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF ROSS, OKAY?

408
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:42,441
AND YOU'RE GOING TO REMEMBER ALL THE BAD THINGS ABOUT HIM.

409
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,944
ALL RIGHT? REALLY FOCUS ON HIS FLAWS.

410
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,445
I CAN DO THAT.

411
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,448
I CERTAINLY DID THAT WHILE WE WERE GOING OUT.

412
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,450
OKAY. HMM, BEFORE WE GET STARTED

413
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,952
I JUST WANT TO SAY FOR THE RECORD

414
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:53,953
THAT I LOVE ROSS.

415
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,955
I THINK HE'S SUCH A GREAT GUY.

416
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,460
OKAY, NOW

417
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,962
CLOSE YOUR EYES

418
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,965
AND IMAGINE THAT YOU'RE WITH ROSS.

419
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,467
OKAY, AND IMAGINE THAT YOU'RE KISSING HIM

420
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,971
AND YOU'RE RUNNING YOUR HANDS ALL OVER HIS BODY

421
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,974
AND THEN YOU RUN YOUR HANDS THROUGH HIS HAIR

422
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,976
BUT, OH! EW! GROSS!

423
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,978
IT'S SOME KIND OF GREASE.

424
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:19,979
IT'S GROSS!

425
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,481
HUH?

426
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,482
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

427
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,985
HIS HAIR NEVER BOTHERED ME THAT MUCH.

428
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,489
AND, YOU KNOW, IT WAS ALWAYS MORE CRUNCHY THAN IT WAS GREASY.

429
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,491
OKAY.

430
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,994
THIS'LL BE HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.

431
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,496
UM, LET'S TRY SOME AVERSION THERAPY.

432
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:38,497
OKAY. OKAY?

433
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:39,999
SO LOOK AT THE PICTURE.

434
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,000
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

435
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,002
AND, UM...

436
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,504
OW!

437
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,010
OKAY. HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW?

438
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,512
WELL, I LIKE YOU LESS.

439
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,027

440
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,030
WOW. THIS IS JUST AS BORING IN ENGLAND.

441
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,037
HEY.

442
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,039
HEY.

443
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,543
OH. SORRY.

444
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,045
YOU KNOW WHAT?

445
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,046
I'M SORRY.

446
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,547
I REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID

447
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,049
THAT YOU WERE EMBARRASSING ME.

448
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,550
THAT REALLY WASN'T COOL.

449
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,053
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER

450
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,055
I'VE HAD A REALLY LOUSY DAY.

451
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,557
ME, TOO.

452
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,558
YEAH?

453
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,059
NO!

454
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,562
I HAD THE BEST DAY EVER.

455
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,565
DUDE, CHECK THIS OUT.

456
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,566
ALL RIGHT, NOW

457
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,069
I'M GOING TO FAST FORWARD PAST THE PART WITH YOU

458
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,072
BECAUSE IT IS BORING.

459
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,573
HEY!

460
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,574
SHH, SHH.

461
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,079
Say hi to my friend and tell him you like my hat.

462
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,580
So what's your friend's name?

463
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:02,581
Chandler.

464
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,083
Okay. So, hi, Chandler.

465
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,584
THAT... THAT WAS...

466
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,087
THAT'S FERGIE, BABY!

467
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,091
Joey says you don't really like his hat

468
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,093
but I think it's kind of dashing.

469
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,596
So I hear you're single now.

470
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,597
Yeah, um...

471
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,600
I don't like the hat that much.

472
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,103
HOW DID YOU...? WHEN DID YOU...?

473
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,606
I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE

474
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,607
SO I'M IN MY MAP, AND...

475
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,109
HEY.

476
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,610
HEY.

477
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,614
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAD A LITTLE TALK WITH EMILY.

478
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,116
YES, I DID.

479
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,619
AND YOU ARE WELCOME.

480
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,121
AM I?

481
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,625
AND WAS IT YOUR IDEA TO POSTPONE THE WEDDING?

482
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,628
UM...

483
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,630
I'M GOING TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

484
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,631
WAIT UP.

485
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,633
HEY, HEY.

486
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,635
SINCE YOU'RE THE FIX IT LADY

487
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,636
HERE'S A PICKLE.

488
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,139
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN THE BRIDE SAYS

489
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,142
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE THE WEDDING AT ALL?

490
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,143
SHE SAID THAT?

491
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,144
YEAH.

492
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,145
WHY?

493
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,646
I DON'T KNOW.

494
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,148
I TOLD HER IT WAS STUPID

495
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,650
TO PUT OFF THE WEDDING JUST BECAUSE THE HALL WAS GONE

496
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,152
AND SHE, LIKE, FLIPPED OUT.

497
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,153
OH, MY GOD.

498
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,655
YOU'RE EVEN DUMB ER THAN I AM.

499
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,157
EXCUSE ME?

500
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,161
ROSS, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN PLANNING THIS WEDDING?

501
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,163
I DON'T KNOW. A MONTH.

502
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,166
EMILY HAS PROBABLY BEEN PLANNING IT SINCE SHE WAS FIVE--

503
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,668
EVER SINCE THE FIRST TIME SHE TOOK A PILLOWCASE

504
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,670
AND HUNG IT OFF THE BACK OF HER HEAD.

505
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,673
THAT'S WHAT WE DID.

506
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,676
WE DREAMED ABOUT THE PERFECT WEDDING...

507
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,179
AND THE PERFECT PLACE...

508
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,183
WITH THE PERFECT FOUR TIERED WEDDING CAKE...

509
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,686
WITH THE LITTLE PEOPLE ON TOP.

510
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,198
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT PART

511
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,700
IS THAT WE HAD THE PERFECT GUY

512
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,203
WHO UNDERSTOOD JUST HOW IMPORTANT

513
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,705
ALL THAT OTHER STUFF WAS.

514
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,708
I HAD NO IDEA.

515
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,710
THAT PILLOWCASE THING?

516
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,215
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE JUST DOING THE FLYING NUN.

517
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,219
SOMETIMES WE WERE.

518
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,721
COME ON.

519
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,724
YOU'RE GOING TO HELP ME FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO, OKAY?

520
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,725
OKAY.

521
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,726
COME ON.

522
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,732
WHOA, PRETTY INTENSE, HUH?

523
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,234
YEAH.

524
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,736
HEY, I HOPE ROSS DIDN'T THINK WE JUST WENT IN THERE

525
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,239
BECAUSE WE WERE UNCOMFORTABLE BEING OUT HERE.

526
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,247
I HOPE HE DID.

527
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,755
OOH. I THOUGHT OF A GOOD FLAW.

528
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,756
ROSS POPS HIS GUM.

529
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,758
OH, RIGHT.

530
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,759
WAIT A MINUTE.

531
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,760
I DO THAT, TOO.

532
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,262
YEAH, I KNOW. IT DRIVES ME CRAZY.

533
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,765

534
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,766
I'LL GET IT.

535
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,769
HELLO.

536
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,271
HEY, PHEEBS. IT'S JOEY.

537
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,772
HEY, JOEY. HEY, OH.

538
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,773
OH, I JUST SAW SOMEONE

539
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,276
THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU ON THE SUBWAY

540
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,278
AND I WAS GOING TO GO OVER AND SAY HI

541
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,781
BUT THEN I FIGURED, HE DOESN'T CARE HE LOOKS LIKE YOU.

542
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,783
THAT JUST COST ME FOUR BUCKS.

543
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,286
BUT, LISTEN, I JUST CALLED

544
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,789
TO SEE HOW THE CHICK AND THE DUCK ARE DOING.

545
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,292
THEY'RE HAVING A GREAT TIME WITH THEIR AUNT PHOEBE.

546
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,293
AUNT RACHEL

547
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,295
HASN'T BEEN HELPFUL AT ALL.

548
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,796
SO DO YOU MISS ME?

549
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,799
KIND OF, BUT I'VE JUST BEEN HAVING WAY TOO MUCH FUN.

550
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,301
OH, SO YOU'RE NOT HOMESICK YET?

551
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,804
NO. I DON'T THINK SO.

552
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,307
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THE SEVEN OF US MISS YOU.

553
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,811
WHO'S SEVEN?

554
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,313
WELL, YOU KNOW, ME, RACHEL

555
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,814
THE BIRDS, THE BABIES.

556
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,817
AW, THE BABIES MISS ME?

557
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,819
OF COURSE THEY DO.

558
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,822
OR I'M JUST REALLY HUNGRY.

559
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,823

560
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,325
THE PIZZA GUY'S HERE.

561
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,327
YOU ORDERED PIZZA WITHOUT ME?

562
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,829
YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WERE THINKING ABOUT YOU.

563
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,332
YOU KNOW, WE ORDERED THE JOEY SPECIAL.

564
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,833
TWO PIZZAS?

565
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:15,834

566
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:16,835
YEP.

567
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,337
OKAY, GOT TO GO.

568
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,338
TALK TO YOU LATER.

569
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,341
WAIT. WHERE DID YOU GET IT FROM?

570
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,849
?? ...Where everybody knows your name ??

571
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,351

572
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:36,355
?? And they're always glad you came ??

573
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,858
?? You want to be where you can see ??

574
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,860
?? Troubles are all the same ??

575
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:46,865
?? You want to be where everybody knows your name. ??

576
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,370
MONICA, WHY HAVE YOU

577
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,872
BROUGHT ME HERE OF ALL PLACES?

578
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:54,873
YOU'LL SEE.

579
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,376
I TELL YOU, THIS WEDDING

580
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,378
IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

581
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,380
OH, GOD.

582
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,883
OKAY, BUT IMAGINE A LOT MORE LIGHTS, OKAY?

583
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,387
AND... AND, YOU KNOW, FEWER BRICKS, AND...

584
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,889
AND FLOWERS AND CANDLES.

585
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,891
AND THE MUSICIANS-- THEY CAN GO OVER HERE

586
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,893
AND THE CHAIRS-- THEY CAN FACE THIS WAY

587
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:15,894
AND...

588
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,396
YOU GO.

589
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,898
BUT... BUT IF  YOU DON'T LOVE THIS

590
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,402
THEN WE'LL DO IT ANY OTHER PLACE, ANY OTHER TIME.

591
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,405
REALLY, IT'S FINE. WHATEVER YOU WANT.

592
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,908
IT'S PERFECT.

593
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,411
AND, I DON'T KNOW,  IF IT STARTS TO RAIN...

594
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,912
WELL, THEN WE'LL GET WET.

595
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,918
OH...

596
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,920
I DON'T EVEN HAVE A DATE.

597
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:44,923
 PHEEBS?

598
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,924
YEAH?

599
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,427
DO YOU REMEMBER WHERE THE DUCK FOOD IS?

600
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,430
YEAH, IT'S IN THE GUYS' APARTMENT UNDER THE SINK. WHY?

601
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,432
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO LONDON.

602
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,433
WHAT?!

603
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,934
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO LONDON?

604
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,936
YEAH, I HAVE TO TELL ROSS THAT I LOVE HIM.

605
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,438
NOW, HONEY, YOU TAKE CARE

606
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,441
AND YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE BABIES TILL I GET BACK.

607
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,443
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE FINDING HIS FLAWS STUFF

608
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,444
WE'VE BEEN DOING?

609
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,446
YEAH. THAT DIDN'T WORK.

610
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:08,947
RACHEL, YOU CAN'T GO.

611
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:09,948
ROSS LOVES EMILY.

612
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,949
I KNOW. I KNOW HE DOES

613
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,951
BUT I HAVE TO TELL HIM HOW I FEEL.

614
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,454
HE DESERVES TO HAVE ALL OF THE INFORMATION

615
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,456
AND THEN HE CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION.

616
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,957
THAT'S NOT WHY YOU'RE GOING.

617
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,960
YOU'RE GOING BECAUSE YOU HOPE HE'S GOING TO SAY

618
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,962
"YEAH, I LOVE YOU, TOO, RACH.

619
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,964
FORGET ABOUT THAT BRITISH CHIPPY."

620
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,466
DO YOU THINK HE WILL?

621
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:31,470
NO, BECAUSE HE'S IN LOVE WITH THE BRITISH CHIPPY.

622
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,472
RACHEL, IF YOU GO

623
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,474
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO MESS WITH HIS HEAD

624
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,475
AND RUIN HIS WEDDING.

625
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:37,976
YOU KNOW, IT'S TOO LATE.

626
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,478
YOU MISSED YOUR CHANCE.

627
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,479
I'M SORRY.

628
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,481
I KNOW THIS MUST BE REALLY HARD.

629
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:46,485
IT'S OVER.

630
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,489
YOU KNOW WHAT? NO.

631
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,991
IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL SOMEONE SAYS, "I DO."

632
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,992
I DO.

633
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,494
I DO. I DO.

634
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,995
I DO! I DO!

635
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,999

636
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,002
YEAH, LIKE I CAN REALLY CHASE YOU.

637
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,004
I'M CARRYING A LITTER.
