1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,504
SO, NOW, WHAT IS THIS NOW?

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,505
GOOGILY WORM.

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,007

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,008
AND THIS?

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,509
GLOW POP JIGGLY JAMMER.

6
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,510

7
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,512
BAIT IS SO FUNNY.

8
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,516
HEY, UM, WHAT'S THIS?

9
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,019
OH, A HUNK OF SANDWICH FROM LAST YEAR.

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,022
OH, GELLER'S GOT ONE HOOKED.

11
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,523
OH! LOOKS LIKE A BIG ONE!

12
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:29,029
UH OH, IT'S THE CLASSIC STRUGGLE BETWEEN MAN AND...

13
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,532
SOMEONE KNOCKED OVER A LAMP.

14
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,535
HEY, YOU GUYS, YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO BE GREAT

15
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,537
ABOUT THE FISHING TRIP THIS YEAR?

16
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,539
WHEN MY DAD GETS ME OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,041
AND GIVES ME THAT, "JOEY, WHAT ARE

18
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,542
YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE?" STUFF

19
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,044
I CAN SAY, "WELL, I'M DOING A MOVIE

20
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,045
"WITH CHARLTON HESTON, DAD.

21
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,047
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE?"

22
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,049

23
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,554
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STOP HAVING FUN JUST BECAUSE I'M HERE.

24
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,057
KATHY DIDN'T CHEAT ON ALL OF YOU.

25
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,060
WELL, EXCEPT YOU.

26
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,567

27
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,569
 HEY, JOEY, I DON'T THINK

28
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,571
YOU KNOW WHAT IS SO SWEET? HMM?

29
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,074
THOSE BIRDS HAVE NOT LEFT HIS SIDE THE WHOLE TIME.

30
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,575
YEAH, I WISH THAT ROOSTER WERE DEAD.

31
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,078
HEY, JOEY, I DON'T THINK

32
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,579
THAT YOU SHOULD LEAVE CHANDLER ALONE.

33
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,081
I MEAN, IT'S ONLY BEEN TWO DAYS

34
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,082
SINCE HE BROKE  UP WITH KATHY.

35
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,084
MAYBE YOU CAN GO FISHING NEXT WEEK.

36
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,086
LOOK. THERE'S NOTHING  I CAN DO FOR HIM RIGHT NOW.

37
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,587
HE'S STILL IN HIS SWEAT PANTS.

38
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,089
THAT'S ONLY PHASE ONE.

39
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,591
YOU KNOW, I'LL BE BACK FOR PHASE TWO.

40
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,593
I WOULD NEVER MISS PHASE TWO.

41
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,095
WHAT'S PHASE TWO?

42
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,597
GETTING DRUNK AND GOING TO A STRIP CLUB.

43
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,101
HOW DOES GOING TO A STRIP CLUB

44
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,602
MAKE HIM BETTER?

45
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,104
THERE ARE NAKED LADIES THERE.

46
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,605
OH, AND IT HELPS HIM GET TO PHASE THREE:

47
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,607
"PICTURING YOURSELF WITH OTHER WOMEN."

48
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,609
THERE ARE NAKED LADIES THERE, TOO.

49
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,111
YEAH.

50
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,112

51
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,616
WOULD YOU GIVE ME ONE MINUTE, PLEASE?

64
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,167
SO, THESE WILL MATCH THE JACKET YOU PICKED OUT FOR ME LAST WEEK?

65
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,668

00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,171

67
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,672
THERE IT IS.

68
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,174
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED?

69
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,675

72
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,180

00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,690

80
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:11,691
WHOOPS!

83
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,698
RACHEL, COULD I HAVE A MOMENT?

84
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,699
YEAH, SURE.

85
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,700
I WAS WONDERING...

86
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,202

00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,703

00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,238
BUT I WAS CURIOUS...

106
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,240
DO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS FOR TONIGHT?

107
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,242
NO. NOTHING!

108
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,244
I INVESTED IN THIS NIGHTCLUB AND IT'S OPENING TONIGHT.

109
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,245
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME?

110
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,247
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

111
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,749

I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT.

128
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,277
IT HAS TWO OUT OF THE THREE TENORS.

129
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,280
OH, YAY!

130
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,786
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE KATHY DID THIS TO ME.

131
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,289
I REALLY THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS THE ONE.

132
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,790
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

133
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,294
FROM NOW ON, I'M NOT GETTING OUT OF THIS CHAIR EVER, OKAY?

134
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,796
FROM NOW ON, THIS CHAIR IS "THE ONE."

135
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,298
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS "THE ONE"?

136
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,299
MY SWEAT PANTS.

137
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,800
COME ON, MAN

138
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,804
JUST JUST TAKE THE SWEATS OFF, OKAY?

139
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,307
JUST TAKE THEM OFF, AND WE'LL HAVE SOME FUN.

140
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,313
WOW, AND I CAN'T RESIST THAT LINE.

141
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,315
THAT'S WHY I NEVER WEAR SWEATPANTS.

142
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,818
HEY, HEY.

143
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,819
HI. HI.

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,821
HAVE A GOOD TIME? CATCH ANY BIG FISH?

145
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,823
OH, MY GOD, YOU GUYS HAVE NO IDEA.

146
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,824
WOW, YOU STINK!

147
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,326
OH, ARE YOU KIDDING?

148
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,328
YEAH, THREE DAYS ON THE LAKE WITHOUT A SHOWER.

149
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,831
PLUS, I FELL INTO THAT BIG TUB OF WORMS AT THE BAIT STAND.

150
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,834
HEY, H HOW'S HE DOING?

151
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,337
HE HASN'T GOTTEN OUT OF THAT CHAIR IN TWO DAYS.

152
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,839
HEY, BUDDY, HOW'S IT GOING?

153
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,846
HEY, YOU SEE THAT?

154
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,348
HE JUST NEEDED HIS PAL TO COME HOME.

155
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,850
ALL RIGHT, I GOT TO GO MEMORIZE MY LINES.

156
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,853

157
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,854

00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,357
 HEY.

160
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,858
 HEY, MONICA.

161
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,860
UH OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,862
OH, IT'S...

163
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,866
JOSHUA INVITED ME TO THIS FANCY CLUB OPENING TONIGHT.

164
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,369

00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,876
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

168
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,378

169
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,379
I DON'T KNOW, SWEETIE.

170
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,880
NO!HELP ME!

171
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,882
I CAN'T. I HAVE TO WORK.

172
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,384
PHOEBE...?

173
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,886
I WOULD, BUT I GET MY MORNING SICKNESS IN THE EVENING.

174
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,888
OH, NO, UNLESS SHE WANTS TO SPEND THE NIGHT

175
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,391
HOLDING MY HAIR BACK FOR ME.

176
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,393
OH, GOSH, YOU GUYS, COME ON.

177
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,395
THIS IS... I HAVE TO MEET JOSHUA.

178
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,398
THIS IS MY ONE CHANCE FOR HIM TO SEE THE FUN RACHEL.

179
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,400
YOU KNOW, THE WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT-

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,402
IF SHE WERE MY WIFE RACHEL?

181

YEAH, THAT THAT IS A TOUGHIE...

197
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,945
OH, SHE'S LOOKING

198
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:26,946
DOWN THE HALL.

199
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:27,947

200
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,449
SHE LOOKED RIGHT AT ME.

201
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,952
OH, WAIT, YOU CAN'T SEE PEOPLE THROUGH THAT LITTLE HOLE

202
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,953
CAN YOU?

203
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,956
HELLO?

204
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,957
 HELLO?

205
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,959

206
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,461
OH, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

207
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,962
OKAY, ROSS, PLEASE COME ON.

208
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,464
I THOUGHT WE HAD MOVED ON.

209
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,965
I THOUGHT WE HAD GOTTEN TO A PLACE

210
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,468
WHERE WE COULD BE HAPPY FOR EACH OTHER.

211
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,469
WAS THAT JUST ME?

212
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,971
ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO IT.

213
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,972
OH, THANK YOU.

214
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,974
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

215
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,476
EMILY?

216
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,477
OH, YES.

217
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:58,978
I'M RACHEL GREEN.

218
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,980
THANK GOODNESS. YEAH.

219
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,483
THERE'S BEEN A TEENY, TEENY CHANGE OF PLANS.

220
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,485
TURNS OUT I'M NOT FREE TONIGHT, SO...

221
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,987
REALLY? WELL, THAT'S JUST LOVELY, ISN'T IT?

222
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,489
I MUST HAVE MISSED YOUR CALL

223
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,991
EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T LEAVE THE FLAT ALL DAY.

224
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,493
OH, WELL, NO, I...

225
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,994
NO, NO, NO, THAT'S NOT RUDE.

226
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,996
IT'S PERFECTLY IN KEEPING WITH THE TRIP

227
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,998
WHERE I'VE ALREADY BEEN RUN DOWN BY ONE

228
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:19,999
OF YOUR WIENER CARTS

229
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,501
AND BEEN STRIP SEARCHED

230
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,002
AT JOHN F. KENNEDY AIRPORT.

231
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,504
APPARENTLY TO YOU PEOPLE

232
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,507
I LOOK LIKE SOMEONE WHO'S GOT A BALLOON FULL OF COCAINE

233
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,509
STUFFED UP THEIR BUM.

234
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,513
I I I THINK YOU LOOK GREAT.

235
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,014
GOOD NIGHT.

236
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,016
IT WAS VERY NICE TO MEET YOU ALL.

237
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,020
I'LL GET HER.

238
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,523
PLEASE, HURRY.

239
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,025
OKAY.

240
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,027
SO, DON'T YOU JUST LOVE THE WAY THEY TALK?

241
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,530
"OOH..." UH, YOU KNOW...

242
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,037
OH!

243
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,038
WHAT?

244
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,040
IT KICKED. I THINK THE BABY KICKED.

245
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,041
OH, MY GOD!

246
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,543

247
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,546
OH, NO, WAIT, OH, THAT WAS THE ELASTIC

248
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,047
IN MY UNDERWEAR BUSTED.

249
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,549
MY GOD! I OVERSLEPT!

250
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,051
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE SET A HALF AN HOUR AGO!

251
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,553
I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE!

252
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,054
OH, WAIT, JOEY, YOU CAN'T GO LIKE THAT.

253
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,556
YOU STINK!

254
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,558
I FELL ASLEEP BEFORE I COULD TAKE A SHOWER

255
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,559
AND NOW I DON'T HAVE TIME.

256
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,061
THEY'RE JUST TEN BLOCKS AWAY. IF I RUN, I CAN MAKE IT.

257
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,063
YEAH, RUN TEN BLOCKS.

258
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,064
THAT'LL HELP THE SMELL.

259
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,566
HEY! OH! SLOW DOWN.

260
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,067
NO, KEEP MOVING.

261
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,570
SO, HOW DID IT GO WITH JOSHUA LAST NIGHT?

262
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,573
OH, WELL, I DIDN'T SEE JOSHUA

263
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,575
BUT I DID PUNCH A GIRL IN THE FACE.

264
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,576
WHAT? WHY?

265
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,077
WELL, THE WHOLE NIGHT

266
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,579
WAS HORRIBLE. IT WAS POURING DOWN RAIN

267
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,082
AND WHEN I GOT THERE, THERE WAS NO RACHEL GREEN ON THE LIST

268
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,584
BUT THERE WAS A RACHEL "GREEP."

269
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,586
OH, SO DID YOU GET TO MEET HER?

270
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,089
NO, THERE IS NO RACHEL GREEP

271
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,091
BUT THEN THIS OTHER GIRL OVERHEARD US

272
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,093
AND SHE WAS ALL, "I'M RACHEL GREEP!

273
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,595
I'M RACHEL GREEP!"

274
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,096
AND HE LET HER RIGHT IN.

275
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,598
SO YOU HIT HER IN THE FACE?

276
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,599
NO, SHE WAS ALREADY IN

277
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,601
BUT THEN THIS BIG BITCH BEHIND ME

278
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,103
TRIED TO STEAL MY UMBRELLA, SO I CLOCKED HER.

279
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,106
OH! I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

280
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,108
ALL I WANTED WAS JUST

281
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,611
A FEW HOURS OUTSIDE OF WORK TO SEE JOSHUA

282
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:17,116
SO THAT HE COULD GO AHEAD AND START FALLING IN LOVE WITH ME.

283
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,618
OH...

284
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,620
PHEEBS.

285
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,623
HONEY, THAT'S YOUR NAME.

286
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,124
THAT'S SHORT FOR PHOEBE?!

287
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,127
I THOUGHT THAT'S JUST WHAT WE CALLED EACH OTHER.

288
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,633
 HEY, YOU'RE WEARING PANTS.

289
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,134
THAT'S RIGHT.

290
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,135
WHERE ARE THE GUYS?

291
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,137
I'M READY TO GET DRUNK

292
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,138
AND SEE SOME STRIPPERS.

293
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,640
IT'S 9:30 IN THE MORNING.

294
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,642
THEY GOT A BREAKFAST BUFFET.

295
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,143

296
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,645
HELLO? OH, HEY, ROSS.

297
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,146
OOH! LET ME TALK TO HIM.

298
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,147
OH, MY GOD!

299
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,649
WELL, CAN I JUST...?

300
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,650
SHH! WAIT, WHAT?

301
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,651
SHE'S SHUSHING ME.

302
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,152
IT'S MY PHONE AND SHE'S...

303
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,654
SHH! PLEASE! WHAT'S HE SAYING?

304
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,657
HE'S WITH EMILY AT A BED AND BREAKFAST IN VERMONT.

305
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,659
WHAT? OH, MY GOD!

306
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,160
WHAT? WHO THE HELL IS EMILY?

307
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,162
NO!

308
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,664
 When we first met her

309
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:05,665
SHE WAS SOAKING.

310
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,166
HER FEET WERE WET.

311
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,668
WHO WOULDN'T BE MISERABLE?

312
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,671
I'M TELLING YOU, ONCE I GOT HER INTO A DRY PAIR OF SHOES

313
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,172
SHE WAS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON.

314
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,173
THEY'RE IN VERMONT?

315
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,675
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

316
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,176
OW.

317
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,678
HOW HOW DID HE END UP

318
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,179
IN VERMONT WITH THAT AWFUL WITCH?

319
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,182
WELL, MAYBE SHE DOESN'T HIT HIM ALL THE TIME.

320
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,685
ROSS, COME QUICKLY.

321
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,687
THERE'S A DEER JUST OUTSIDE EATING FRUIT FROM THE ORCHARD.

322
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,188
I GOT TO GO! THERE'S A DEER JUST OUTSIDE

323
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,690
EATING FRUIT FROM THE ORCHARD.

324
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,194
HE HAD TO GO.

325
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,197
THERE WAS A DEER JUST OUTSIDE EATING FRUIT FROM THE ORCHARD.

326
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,700
I DON'T GET THIS.

327
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,201
SHE WAS HORRIBLE.

328
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,203
OKAY, I'M GOING TO GO STAND OVER THERE.

329
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,707
WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH ANYWAY?

330
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,709
I DON'T CARE.

331
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,710
YOU KNOW WHAT?

332
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,211
I'M JUST UPSET

333
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,713
THAT I'M GETTING NOWHERE WITH JOSHUA

334
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,214
THAT... YOU KNOW WHAT?

335
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,716
STILL, YOU DO NOT JUST MEET SOMEONE

336
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,217
AND GO FLITTING OFF TO VERMONT.

337
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,221
WELL, WHEN YOU FIRST MET BARRY, YOU FLITTED OFF TO VAIL.

338
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,224
OH, YOU KNOW, COULD YOU JUST FOR ONCE

339
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,727
NOT REMEMBER EVERY LITTLE THING?

340
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,732
SO, YOU KNOW, UH, WHEN'S HE GETTING BACK?

341
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,233
COUPLE OF DAYS.

342
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,234
YOU KNOW WHAT?

343
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,235
I KNEW SOMETHING

344
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,737
LIKE THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN

345
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,739
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

346
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,740
CHANDLER...

347
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,742
YOU CAN'T JUST GO BACK A PHASE.

348
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,743
YES, YOU CAN.

349
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,244
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT TIME.

350
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,245
YOU CAN'T

351
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,247
GO BACK IN TIME.

352
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,749
WELL, LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU JUST...

353
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,752
WHY DON'T YOU DO YOUR PHASE TWO STRIP CLUB THING WITH US?

354
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,253
YEAH, COME ON, WE CAN BE GUYS.

355
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,255
NO, YOU CAN'T.

356
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,757
COME ON, LET US BE GUYS.

357
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,759
MAYBE WE WANT TO BE GUYS.

358
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,261
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE GUYS.

359
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,764
YOU'D BE ALL HAIRY, AND YOU WOULDN'T LIVE AS LONG.

360
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,766
YOU... WOULD YOU JUST STOP BEING SUCH A WUSS

361
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,268
AND GET THOSE OFF, AND YOU COME

362
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,772
WITH US AND WATCH NAKED GIRLS DANCE AROUND!

363
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,274
OKAY.

364
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,277
I'M SORRY.

365
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,278
COME ON.

366
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,284
HEY. JOEY TRIBBIANI. I'M HERE.

367
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,786
CALM DOWN, WE GOT TIME.

368
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,287
WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE LATE.

369
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,288
OH.

370
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,291
ALL SET.

371
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,296
 LOOK AT THAT.

372
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,299
CHARLTON HESTON EATING A LICORICE WHIP.

373
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,801
YEAH, HE LOVES THEM.

374
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,803
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM WITH...

375
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,804

376
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,305

377
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,807
HEY... WHOA...

378
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,809
YEAH, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

379
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,811
WHAT SMELLS SO BAD?

380
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,312
YOU.

381
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,314
OH. I COULD SEE WHY YOU WOULD THINK THAT

382
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,816
BUT, UH...

383
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,818
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHO I THINK IT IS?

384
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,819
YOU?

385
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,821
NO, NO, IT'S, UH...

386
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,822
IT'S HESTON.

387
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,325
WHAT?

388
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,326
OH, THE MAN REEKS.

389
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,829
SMELLS LIKE HE WENT ON A THREE DAY FISHING TRIP

390
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,830
AND THEN ATE SOME LICORICE.

391
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,331
THERE'S NO WAY HE SMELLS.

392
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,332
HE'S THE ONLY ONE AROUND HERE

393
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,334
WITH A SHOWER IN HIS DRESSING ROOM.

394
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,335
REALLY?

395
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,336
A SHOWER, HUH?

396
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,339
AND, UH, WHICH ROOM MIGHT THAT BE?

397
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,842
THE ONE WITH "HESTON" ON IT.

398
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,345
INTERESTING.

399
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,356
??
?? I'M GONNA TAKE MY TIME

400
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,858
HEY...

401
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,860
I GOT SOME ONES.

402
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,362
YOU WANT TO PUT THEM IN HER PANTIES?

403
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,865
NO, THANKS, MOM.

404
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,868
OH, NO, UM, HI.

405
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,370
THAT, THAT... UM, YOU HAVE TO PUT THAT OUT

406
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,372
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT, SO...

407
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,374
WELL, MAYBE YOU AND YOUR BABY

408
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,877
OUGHT TO GO TO ANOTHER STRIP CLUB.

409
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,880
HA HA, IT'S NOT MY BABY, HA HA HA.

410
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,383
VERY GOOD, YES.

411
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,385
THAT WAS SO GOOD.

412
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,888
REALLY, REALLY ENJOYED IT.

413
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,890
YOU KNOW, VERY EXOTIC.

414
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,892
WELL, I JUST CHECKED OUR MESSAGES

415
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,893
AND JOSHUA DIDN'T CALL.

416
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,894
YOU WOULD THINK

417
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,395
HE WOULD BE WORRIED

418
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,397
ABOUT ME NOT SHOWING UP AT HIS CLUB.

419
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,900
OH, AND YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES IT SO MUCH WORSE?

420
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,402
ROSS IS ALL HAPPY IN VERMONT.

421
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,906
COME ON, LOOK WHERE YOU ARE.

422
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,408
IF YOU GET A SEC, ANOTHER ROUND OF DAIQUIRIS.

423
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,911
REMEMBER, UM, VIRGIN FOR ME, PLEASE.

424
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,912
OH, AND DON'T LET ME LEAVE

425
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,413
WITHOUT GETTING THE NAME OF THAT CARPET GUY.

426
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,415
OH...!

427
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,917
OH, AND SHARON, YOU KNOW WHAT, HON, YOU MIGHT WANT TO JUST...

428
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,920
OH, COME ON!

429
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,421
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT?

430
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,423
I'M JUST GOING TO GO HOME AND CALL KATHY.

431
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,926
WELL, IF YOU THINK IT'LL HELP.

432
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,427
NO, THAT WAS A TEST. YOU KNOW, IN A COUPLE HOURS

433
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,929
I'M GOING TO GET REALLY DRUNK

434
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,930
AND I'M GOING TO WANT TO CALL KATHY

435
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,431
AND YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO STOP ME.

436
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,433
AND THEN AFTER THAT, I'M GOING TO BE SO DRUNK

437
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,434
I'M GOING TO WANT TO CALL JANICE.

438
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,435
YOU SHOULD. HOW IS SHE?

439
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,436
OH!

440
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,941
I THINK SOMEBODY NEEDS ANOTHER LAP DANCE.

441
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,943

442
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,954

443
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,959
HELLO?

444
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,460
WHO'S IN THERE?

445
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,968
HOW YOU DOING?

446
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,469
WHO IN THE HELL ARE YOU?

447
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,971
UH...

448
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,472
I GUESS YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME

449
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,474
IF I SAID I WAS KIRK DOUGLAS, HUH?

450
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,479
PUT SOME PANTS ON, KID, SO I CAN KICK YOUR BUTT.

451
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,482
NO NO NO, NO, NO, WAIT, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

452
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,486
SEE, I'M AN ACTOR.

453
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,487
JOEY TRIBBIANI.

454
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,489
I'M DOING A SCENE WITH YOU TODAY

455
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,991
AND, WELL, I STINK.

456
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,993
YOU'RE IN THIS PICTURE?

457
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:34,994
YEAH, YEAH.

458
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,496
I'M ONE OF THE COPS WHO WON'T WORK WITH YOU

459
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,998
BECAUSE YOU'RE A LOOSE CANNON.

460
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,001
ANYWAY, LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY, BUT I JUST... I STINK.

461
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,004
JOEY, RIGHT?

462
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,006
YEAH.

463
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,507
COME ON, COME ON.

464
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,510
EVERY ACTOR AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER...

465
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,012
AH!

466
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,516
EVERY ACTOR THINKS HE STINKS.

467
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,520
EVEN LAURENCE OLIVIER SOMETIMES THOUGHT HE STANK.

468
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,023
BOB REDFORD WON'T EVEN WATCH HIMSELF.

469
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,524
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

470
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,525
LISTEN TO ME.

471
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,027
OH, YEAH.

472
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,029
I DON'T KNOW ONE ACTOR

473
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,032
WORTH HIS SALT WHO ONE TIME IN HIS CAREER

474
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,034
DIDN'T SAY, "GOD, I STINK."

475
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,537
HELL, I JUST DID A SCENE OUT THERE, FIRST TAKE...

476
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,539
I STUNK THE PLACE UP

477
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,541
BUT...

478
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,043
THE IMPORTANT THING

479
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,544
YOU MUST REMEMBER:

480
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,547
NO MATTER HOW BADLY YOU THINK YOU STINK

481
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:32,051
YOU MUST NEVER, EVER BUST INTO MY DRESSING ROOM

482
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,552
AND USE MY SHOWER.

483
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,056
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

484
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,058
YES, SIR. YES, SIR. I'M I'M VERY SORRY.

485
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,059
WAIT A MINUTE.

486
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,560
TAKE YOUR PANTS.

487
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,063
YEAH, OH, YEAH.

488
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,064
I'M SORRY.

489
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,565
I'M REALLY SORRY.

490
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,567

491
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,069
WHAT A BUSINESS.

492
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,073

493
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,575
SO, WE DID OKAY AT THE STRIP CLUB, RIGHT?

494
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,077
OH, YEAH, THAT WAS GREAT.

495
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,078
THANKS TO YOU

496
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,081
THE HOTTEST COCKTAIL WAITRESS THERE IS QUITTING

497
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,082
TO TEACH THE THIRD GRADE.

498
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,583
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

499
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,584
HE STILL HASN'T CALLED.

500
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,585
WHO? JOSH?

501
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,087
IT'S JOSHUA.

502
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,588
WHAT, HE DOESN'T LIKE "JOSH"?

503
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,589
NO, I DON'T.

504
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,592
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'M GOING TO PUT MY SWEATS BACK ON.

505
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,593
NO, WAIT, WAIT.

506
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,595
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU WERE RIGHT.

507
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,597
WE REALLY WEREN'T GREAT AT BEING GUYS

508
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,099
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHY?

509
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,100
BECAUSE WE'RE GIRLS.

510
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,602
YEAH?

511
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,604
OKAY, DO YOU KNOW WHAT GIRLS ARE REALLY GOOD AT?

512
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,106
STRIPPING.

513
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,109
NO. LISTENING.

514
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,610
SIT.

515
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,114
YOU KNOW, MAYBE JUST IT WOULD REALLY, REALLY HELP

516
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,116
IF YOU WOULD JUST TALK.

517
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,117
YEAH, COME ON.

518
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,119
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?

519
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,621
 YEAH.

520
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,124
AND, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT TO CRY...

521
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,625
THAT'S OKAY, TOO.

522
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,627
OKAY, LOOK, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK

523
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,129
YOU ALL TO LEAVE.

524
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,130
COME ON, CHANDLER.

525
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,631
OH, LOOK, FORGET IT.

526
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,634
WE TRIED, BUT PHASE THREE IS A LOST CAUSE.

527
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,137
OKAY? THOSE STRIPPERS WERE INSANELY HOT

528
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,140
AND I COULDN'T PICTURE MYSELF WITH ANY OF THEM.

529
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,641

530
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,145
THEY REALLY WERE PRETTY, WEREN'T THEY?

531
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,646
OH... OOH...

532
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,648
YOU KNOW, I REALLY LIKED THAT FIGHTER PILOT ONE.

533
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,151
OH, CANDY? OH, SHE WAS SO SPUNKY.

534
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,652
YEAH.

535
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,653
BUT YOU KNOW, I THINK

536
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,156
IF I WERE GOING TO BE WITH A WOMAN...

537
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,160
IT'D BE WITH SOMEONE LIKE MICHELLE

538
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,662
BECAUSE SHE WAS... SHE WAS JUST SO PETITE.

539
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,164
SEE, I DON'T KNOW.

540
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,166
FOR ME IT WOULD HAVE TO BE CHANTAL.

541
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,667
 OH, CHANTAL.

542
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,668
YOU KNOW?

543
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,170
OH, MY GOODNESS. OH...

544
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,671
SHE HAD THE SMOOTHEST SKIN.

545
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,674
I MEAN, WHEN I STUFFED THAT DOLLAR BILL IN HER G STRING

546
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,176
AND GRAZED HER THIGH...

547
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,677
PHASE THREE!

548
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,180
I JUST ACHIEVED PHASE THREE!

549
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,681
REALLY?

550
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,184
I AM TOTALLY PICTURING YOU WITH ALL THOSE WOMEN.

551
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,187
THAT'S... THAT'S NOT PHASE THREE.

552
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,689
WELL, I'M THERE, TOO.

553
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,193
WELL, ARE WE ALL TOGETHER, LIKE IN A GROUP?

554
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,194
STOP IT!

555
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,195
YOU'RE KILLING ME!

556
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,197
I THINK I JUST MOVED ON TO PHASE FOUR.

557
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,199
OH, WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS THAT?

558
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:04,203
WHERE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP EVER.

559
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,705

INCREDIBLE.

573
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,238
I MEAN, THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE HER.

574
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,741
THE WHOLE WEEKEND WAS, WAS LIKE A DREAM.

575
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,244

581
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,755

582
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,259
I MEAN, I... I I ADMIT I WASN'T QUITE THERE.

583
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,261

588
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,771

589
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,773

590
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,774

00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,280
I'M FINALLY WHERE YOU ARE.

594
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,282
OH, THANK GOODNESS.

595
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,785
YEAH, AND... AND THANK YOU FOR EMILY.

596
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,287
OH, NO PROBLEM.

597
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,289
I'M SO GLAD I COULD HELP.

598
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,291
YOU KNOW, HAPPY FOR YOU.

599
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,792
HAPPY FOR YOU.

600
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,793
OH, NO.

601
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,795
HAPPY FOR YOU.

602
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,303
ALL RIGHT, LADIES, HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.

603
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,305
YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES;

604
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,807
YOU TWO GO GET THE OILS;

605
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,810
AND YOU JUST CONSTANTLY SCREAM AT THE TOP OF YOUR VOICE

606
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,313
"CHANDLER'S THE KING! CHANDLER'S THE KING!"

607
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,814
I WANT TO BE WITH HER.

608
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,316
I LIKE HER.

609
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,317
OH, THAT'S FINE.

610
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,818
GO WITH YOUR INSTINCTS, GO WITH YOUR INSTINCTS.

611
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,819
WAIT NOW, WHAT AM I DOING AGAIN?

612
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,820
OH, COME ON, WOULD YOU PLEASE

613
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:02,821
PAY ATTENTION?

614
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,823
I COULD WAKE UP AT ANY MOMENT.

615
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,825
I'M JOSHUA. I'M HERE TO PICK UP RACHEL.

616
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,827
NO, NO. THAT'S NOT JOSHUA.

617
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,829
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

618
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,830
I NEVER MET THE GUY.

619
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,334
SO, ANYWAY, RACHEL, I'M SORRY YOU CAN'T STAY.

620
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,335
THE REST OF US HAVE

621
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,337
A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

622
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,343
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

623
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,345
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, I GOT TO WAKE UP.
