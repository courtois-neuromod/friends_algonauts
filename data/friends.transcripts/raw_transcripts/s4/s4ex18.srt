1
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:03,937
HEY!

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:06,006
HEY. WOW, IT IS TRUE WHAT THEY SAY

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,008
PREGNANT BELLIES LOOK LIKE A DRUM.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,511
HA, HA.

5
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,013
NO, IT'S JUST, I'M SO PREGNANT

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,015
THAT MY GUITAR DOESN'T FIT ANYMORE

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,516
SO I THOUGHT, TILL I'M NOT

8
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,518
I'M JUST GOING  TO PLAY ALL MY SONGS

9
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,519
ON THIS DRUM.

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,021
IT SOUNDS REALLY COOL.

11
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,022
OH, YEAH?

12
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,023
LISTEN, LISTEN.

13
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,024
OKAY.

14
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,528
?? SMELLY CAT, SMELLY CAT ??

15
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,032
?? WHAT ARE THEY FEEDING YOU? ??

16
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,038

17
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,539
WOW, PHEEBS, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,042
I KNOW, I KNOW! AND I'VE ONLY BEEN PLAYING

19
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,543
FOR, LIKE, AN HOUR.

20
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,047
PHOEBE. PHOEBE, HI.

21
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,548
HI. HI. HEY.

22
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,549
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

23
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,550
ACTUALLY, I CAME DOWN

24
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,052
TO ASK YOU A BIG FAVOR.

25
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,553
OH. WELL, DON'T TELL ME

26
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,056
YOU WANT TO KEEP MORE OF YOUR STUFF

27
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,057
IN MY UTERUS.

28
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,058

29
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,059
NO, NO, NO.

30
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,060
OH.

31
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,062
...
OKAY, NOW, SEE

32
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,564
I WANT TO NAME THE GIRL BABY "LESLIE"

33
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,066
AND, UM, FRANK WANTS

34
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,568
TO NAME ONE OF THE BOY BABIES...

35
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,570
"FRANK JR., JR."

36
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,573
WOULDN'T THAT BE "FRANK THE THIRD"?

37
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,075
DON'T GET ME STARED.

38
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,579
ANYWAY, UM, SINCE THERE ARE THREE BABIES

39
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,083
AND, UM, WE BOTH GOT TO PUT OUR NAMES IN

40
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,085
WE WOULD BE TRULY HONORED

41
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,087
IF YOU WOULD NAME THE OTHER BOY BABY.

42
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,588
OH, WOW!

43
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:29,589
THAT'S SO NICE.

44
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,592
OH! OH! "COUGAR."

45
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,595
YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

46
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,097
YEAH.

47
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,598
YEAH.

60
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,082
I LEFT A BRA DRYING ON THE SHOWER ROD.

61
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,584
YOU DON'T THINK YOUR SON WILL THINK IT'S YOURS

62
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:32,585
AND BE HORRIBLY TRAUMATIZED?

63
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,154
HEY, MOMMY CAN HAVE A WIFE

64
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,655
DADDY CAN HAVE A BRA.

65
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,157

66
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,658
OH, IT'S TIME TO GO.

67
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,659
OH, NO, NO, NO.

68
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,661
SEE, THAT THAT CLOCK'S A LITTLE FAST.

69
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,664
UH, WE... WE STILL HAVE 17 MINUTES.

70
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:49,669
HUH. WHAT CAN WE DO IN 17 MINUTES... TWICE?

71
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,171
WOW, THAT'S AMBITIOUS.

72
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,672
MMM...

73
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,673

74
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,176
OKAY, YOU CAN IGNORE THAT. IT'S...

75
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,177
THAT'S CAROL WITH YOUR SON.

76
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,678
UH, BELIEVE ME

77
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,680
WHEN HE'S OLDER, HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

78
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,182
 ROSS?

79
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,683
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

80
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,684

81
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,190
HELLO! HI.

82
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,192
HELLO. HELLO.

83
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,193
HI. HEY.

84
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,694
EMILY, THIS IS CAROL AND SUSAN.

85
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,696
IT'S SO NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

86
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,697
YOU, TOO.

87
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,199
SUSAN'S SHOOTING A COMMERCIAL

88
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,200
IN LONDON NEXT WEEK.

89
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,701
YEAH. I'M SO EXCITED.

90
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,702
I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE.

91
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:23,703
I'LL SHOW YOU AROUND.

92
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:24,704
THAT'D BE GREAT.

93
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,706
ALSO, I WAS HOPING TO CATCH A SHOW.

94
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,708
SO, IF YOU CAN MAKE ANY SUGGESTIONS...

95
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,710
THERE'S TONS OF TERRIFIC STUFF.

96
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,711
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

97
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,712
AH.

98
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,713
OH, I'M SORRY.

99
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,215
OH, WOW.

100
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,217
OH, LOOK AT YOU TWO, BONDING

101
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,219
MAKING US LATE FOR THE AIRPORT, SO...

102
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,221
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

103
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,222
HE'S FINE. HE'S FINE.

104
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,723
IT'S JUST US GETTING ALONG

105
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,724
IS DIFFICULT FOR HIM

106
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,226
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T LIKE ME.

107
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,727
WHAT... OH...

108
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,730
COME ON, THAT'S, THAT'S... IT'S TRUE.

109
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,243
HOW DID WE... LOSE?

110
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,745
HI. HEY.

111
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,747
HEY, DO WE HAVE A BABY NAME YET?

112
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,250
OH, NO. IT'S SO HARD.

113
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,752
I WENT THROUGH THIS WHOLE BOOK AND FOUND NOTHING.

114
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,255
I WANT A NAME THAT'S REALLY, LIKE, YOU KNOW

115
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,758
STRONG AND CONFIDENT, YOU KNOW, LIKE, LIKE "EXXON."

116
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,761
WELL, IT CERTAINLY WORKED

117
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,763
FOR THAT VALDEZ KID.

118
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,266
OH, OH! PHEEBS, YOU WANT A STRONG NAME?

119
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,268
HOW ABOUT "THE HULK"?

120
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,769
I DON'T KNOW.

121
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,271
I'M I'M NOT SURE ABOUT "HULK"

122
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,274
BUT I LIKE THE IDEA OF A NAME STARTING WITH "THE."

123
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,775
OH, YOU WANT A GOOD NAME?

124
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,776
GO WITH "JOEY."

125
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,777
JOEY IS YOUR PAL.

126
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,778
JOEY IS YOUR BUDDY.

127
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,280
"WHERE IS EVERYBODY?"

128
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,782
"WELL, THEY'RE HANGING OUT WITH JOEY."

129
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,284
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT--

130
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,286
IF YOU'RE GOING TO NAME HIM "JOEY"--

131
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,287
YOU SHOULD NAME HIM

132
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,788
"CHANDLER."

133
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,290
OH, COME ON-- CHANDLER'S FUNNY

134
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,792
HE'S SOPHISTICATED, AND HE'S VERY LOVABLE

135
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,794
ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW HIM.

136
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,795
OH, WELL,  HEY

137
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,297
JOEY'S LOVABLE, TOO

138
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,798
BUT THE THING ABOUT JOEY IS

139
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,301
IF YOU NEED HIM, HE'LL BE THERE.

140
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,803
WELL, CHANDLER WILL BE THERE FOR YOU, TOO.

141
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,805
I MEAN, HE MIGHT BE A LITTLE LATE, BUT...

142
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,806
BUT HE'LL BE THERE

143
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,808
AND HE'LL BRING YOU SOME COLD SODA

144
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,312
IF WHAT YOU NEED HIM FOR IS THAT YOU'RE REALLY HOT.

145
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,313
HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

146
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,814
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

147
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,816
WELL, I... I LIKE THE IDEA

148
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,319
OF NAMING HIM AFTER SOMEONE I LOVE

149
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,822
AND "JOEY" AND "CHANDLER" ARE BOTH GREAT NAMES...

150
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,829
BUT... ALL RIGHT, I DON'T...

151
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,332
MAYBE I WILL JUST NAME HIM "THE HULK."

152
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,335
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE MENTIONED IT.

153
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,337
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO NAME MY KID.

154
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,342
 IF YOU WERE HOPING TO SLEEP WITH JOSHUA

155
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,843
FOR THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT

156
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,346
WHICH ONE OF THESE WOULD YOU WANT TO BE WEARING?

157
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,348
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT REALLY CREEPS ME OUT

158
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,350
CHOOSING OTHER PEOPLE'S SEX CLOTHES.

159
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,352
OH. I'M SORRY.

160
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,853
I'M JUST SO EXCITED.

161
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,855
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR MONTHS.

162
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,357
GOT MY HAIR COLORED.

163
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,358
GOT NEW SHEETS.

164
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,859
MAKING HIM A VERY FANCY MEAL.

165
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,860
MM HMM...

166
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,862
WHAT AM I MAKING HIM, BY THE WAY?

167
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,365
WELL, YOU'RE MAKING HIM A FRISEE SALAD

168
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,367
WITH GOAT CHEESE AND PINE NUTS

169
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,869
WILD RICE, ROASTED ASPARAGUS

170
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,871
AND SALMON EN CROUTE.

171
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,873
I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING HIM FILET MIGNON.

172
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,876
YEAH, YOU WERE, BUT THEN YOU DECIDED TO MAKE SALMON

173
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,379
BECAUSE YOU HAD SOME LEFT OVER AT THE RESTAURANT

174
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,881
AND THEN YOU REALIZED IF YOU BITCHED ABOUT IT

175
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,883
THEN YOU WOULD STOP COOKING

176
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,386
AND YOU WOULD HAVE TO MAKE YOUR FAMOUS BAKED POTATO

177
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,387
AND DIET COKE.

178
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,389
WOW, I REALLY GET CRABBY WHEN I COOK.

179
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,890
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE GOING

180
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,892
THROUGH ALL THIS TROUBLE ANYWAY-- HE'S A GUY.

181
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,394
YOU COULD ACTUALLY SERVE THE POTATO

182
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,396
AND HE'D STILL WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU.

183
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,899
YEAH? WELL, THAT IS NOT HOW I OPERATE.

184
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,411
WE GOT TO GET A NEW GAME.

185
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,412
HEY.

186
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,414
HEY. HEY. HEY.

187
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,916
SO, UH, EMILY CALLED LAST NIGHT.

188
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,919
AND NOW YOU'RE GIVING ME THE MESSAGE?

189
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:07,927
TURNS OUT THAT EMILY IS JUST CRAZY ABOUT SUSAN. YEAH.

190
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,930
THEY'RE GOING TO THE THEATER TOGETHER...

191
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,433
THEY'RE GOING TO DINNER...

192
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,935
THEY'RE GOING HORSE BACK RIDING.

193
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,438
GOD, SUSAN IS SO FUN.

194
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,940

195
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,445
LOOK, THIS IS JUST A LITTLE TOO FAMILIAR, OKAY?

196
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,948
FOR FOR, LIKE, SIX MONTHS BEFORE CAROL AND I SPLIT UP

197
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,952
ALL I HEARD WAS, "MY FRIEND SUSAN IS IS SO SMART."

198
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,954
"MY FRIEND SUSAN IS SO FUNNY."

199
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,457
"MY FRIEND SUSAN IS SO GREAT."

200
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,958
YOU ACTUALLY THINK

201
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,460
THAT SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN

202
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,461
BETWEEN EMILY AND SUSAN?

203
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,964
HEY, THEY'RE GOING TO THE GYM TOGETHER.

204
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,467
TWO WOMEN?

205
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,968
STRETCHING?

206
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,470
YOU KNOW, THEY TAKE

207
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,473
A STEAM TOGETHER, THINGS GET A LITTLE PLAYFUL...

208
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,974
DIDN'T YOU SEE PERSONAL BEST?

209
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,976
NO, BUT I'M GOING TO.

210
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,981
HI! HI! YOU'RE CRAZY.

211
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:02,982
THIS IS EMILY.

212
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,484
EMILY IS STRAIGHT.

213
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,985
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

214
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,488
I MEAN, WE THOUGHT CAROL WAS STRAIGHT

215
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,489
BEFORE I MARRIED HER.

216
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:10,990
YEAH, DEFINITELY

217
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,992
I DON'T LIKE THE NAME "ROSS."

218
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,498
WHAT A WEIRD WAY TO KICK ME WHEN I'M DOWN.

219
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,501
NO, NO. I JUST... I MEANT FOR THE BABY.

220
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,002
OH.

221
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,505
WHAT'S WRONG WITH "ROSS"?

222
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,006
WELL, IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW

223
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,509
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN

224
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,511
TO, LIKE, THE HULK, YOU KNOW.

225
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,014
ACTUALLY, THAT- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

226
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,517
IN THE INCREDIBLE HULK, UH, NUMBER 72

227
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,519
DR. BRUCE BANNER FOUND FOUND...

228
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,022
YOU KNOW... NEVER MIND.

229
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,525
MY GIRLFRIEND'S A LESBIAN.

230
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,527
SO, I DECIDED

231
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,028
I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO GO

232
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,030
WITH EITHER "JOEY" OR "CHANDLER."

233
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,031
OH!

234
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,032
OH, OH, OH, OH!

235
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,534
YOU GOT TO PICK "JOEY."

236
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,537
I MEAN, NAME ONE FAMOUS PERSON NAMED "CHANDLER."

237
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,038
RAYMOND CHANDLER.

238
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,540
SOMEONE YOU DIDN'T MAKE UP.

239
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,041

240
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,544
OKAY, THERE ARE NO FAMOUS "JOEYS," EXCEPT FOR...

241
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,545

242
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,046
JOEY BUTTAFUOCO.

243
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,550
YEAH, THAT GUY REALLY HURT US.

244
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,051
AH. YE

245
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,554
WELL, HOW ABOUT A COMPROMISE, THEN, OKAY?

246
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,556
WHAT IF IT'S, YOU KNOW... "CHANOEY"?

247
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,557
OKAY, LOOK-- "JOEY"?

248
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,058
COME ON, THINK ABOUT IT.

249
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,060
FIRST OF ALL, HE'LL NEVER BE PRESIDENT.

250
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,062
I MEAN, THERE'S NEVER GOING TO BE

251
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,564
A PRESIDENT JOEY.

252
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,066
ALL RIGHT, MAN, I DIDN'T WANT TO BRING THIS UP

253
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,068
BUT "CHANDLER" IS THE STUPIDEST NAME

254
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,069
I EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE.

255
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,572
IT'S NOT EVEN A NAME.

256
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,073
IT'S BARELY EVEN A WORD, OKAY?

257
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,576
IT'S KIND OF LIKE "CHANDELIER"

258
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,578
BUT IT'S NOT.

259
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,080
AND THEN, YOU PUT IT TOGETHER WITH "BING"

260
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,582
AND FORGET ABOUT IT.

261
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,084
IT'S A STUPID, STUPID NON NAME.

262
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,090
WOW, YOU'RE... YOU'RE RIGHT.

263
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,594
I HAVE A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE NAME.

264
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,598
I'M SORRY, MAN. I DIDN'T...

265
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,100
I'M I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

266
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,103
SO, I GUESS IT'S "JOEY," THEN.

267
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,112
THIS IS SO NICE.

268
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,114
THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS.

269
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,117
OH, PLEASE. COOKING SOOTHES ME.

270
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,119

271
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,622

272
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,623
SO, DIG IN.

273
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,626
RIGHT. OH, IT  ALL LOOKS SO GOOD.

274
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,127

275
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,128
MMM!

276
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,131
OH, MY GOD.

277
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,132
OH, I KNOW.

278
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,634
MY GOD, THIS IS SO...

279
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,635
THIS RICE IS SO...

280
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,136
I AM SO GOOD.

281
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,137
BEHIND YOU.

282
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,140
OH, YEAH, SORRY.

283
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,141
THEY USED TO LIVE HERE

284
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,143
AND SOMETIMES THEY MIGRATE BACK OVER.

285
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,646
IS THERE, UH... IS THERE SOME WAY

286
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,148
THAT THEY COULD, UH... NOT BE HERE?

287
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,151
IT'S JUST THAT, UH, FARM BIRDS REALLY KIND OF FREAK ME OUT.

288
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,153
YEAH, SURE, OKAY. OKAY.

289
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,154
OKAY, GREAT.

290
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,656
COME ON. SHOO. SHOO.

291
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,157

00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,160
ALL RIGHT. WHOA!

294
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,161
OH, SORRY. COME HERE.

295
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,162
GOOD. THERE YOU GO.

296
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,664
OKAY.

297
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,167

298
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,675
HEY, HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

299
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,677
COME ON.

300
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,178
COME HERE.

301
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,179
ALL GONE.

302
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,180

303
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,682
SO, FARM BIRDS, HUH?

304
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,685
YEAH. IT'S, UH, IT'S MY ONLY WEIRD THING, I SWEAR.

305
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,687
AND I I I WOULD'VE TOLD YOU ABOUT IT

306
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,189
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY WOULD... BE HERE.

307
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,691
OH, OKAY.

308
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:32,692
SO, ALL RIGHT...

309
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,694

310
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,695

311
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,697
OKAY.

312
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,199
SO, CAN I SERVE YOU A LITTLE OF...

313
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,701
WHAT? WHAT'S...? WHAT?

314
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,202
NOTHING. I, UH...

315
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:47,707
IT'S JUST THAT I KNOW THAT THEY'RE STILL OUT THERE.

316
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,208
BUT THEY'RE ACROSS THE HALL.

317
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,210
I MEAN, THAT'S TWO DOORS AWAY.

318
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,212
IT'S GOING TO TAKE THEM A LONG TIME

319
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,214
TO PECK THEIR WAY BACK OVER HERE.

320
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,716

321
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,218
HEY, THAT'S THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

322
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,720
UH...

323
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,221
OKAY, YOU KNOW...

324
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,723
WOULD YOU FEEL BETTER

325
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,224
IF WE WENT SOMEPLACE ELSE?

326
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,226
I MEAN, WE COULD PACK ALL THIS STUFF UP

327
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,228
AND, YOU KNOW, GO TO YOUR APARTMENT.

328
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,230
OH, THEY'RE WORKING ON IT THIS WEEK.

329
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,231
IT'S A TOTAL MESS.

330
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,233
BUT I'M STAYING  AT MY PARENTS' HOUSE.

331
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,234
WE COULD GO THERE.

332
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,235
YOUR PARENTS?

333
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,236
THEY'RE OUT OF TOWN.

334
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,238
OH.

335
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,741
YEAH, IT'S A HUGE PLACE, AND AND IT'S GOT

336
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,242
THIS GORGEOUS VIEW OF THE PARK.

337
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,744
IT'D BE VERY , VERY ROMANTIC.

338
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,245
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

339
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,748
YEAH, THAT WORKS.

340
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,750

341
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,752
YEAH, THEY THEY CAN SMELL THE FEAR.

342
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,756
HEY. HI.

343
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,757
HOW'S BEN?

344
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,259
WELL, I ASKED HIM IF HE WANTED TO EAT

345
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,260
HE SAID, "NO."

346
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,262
I ASKED HIM IF HE WANTED TO SLEEP

347
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,263
HE SAID, "NO."

348
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,765
I ASKED HIM WHAT HE WANTED TO DO

349
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,268
HE SAID, "NO," SO HE'S SWEEPING.

350
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,270
HEY, BUDDY.

351
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,271
HEY.

352
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,272
SO, UM...

353
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,775
ANY WORD FROM SUSAN?

354
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,776
OH, YEAH. SHE SAID

355
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,278
SHE'S HAVING SO MUCH FUN WITH EMILY.

356
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,280
UH HUH, UH HUH.

357
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,283
UH, BY THE BY, DID IT, UH...

358
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,286
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT, I DON'T KNOW

359
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,790
MAYBE THEY MIGHT BE HAVING A LITTLE TOO MUCH FUN?

360
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,291
WHAT'S "TOO MUCH FUN"?

361
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,293
YOU KNOW, THE KIND OF FUN YOU AND SUSAN HAD

362
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,795
WHEN WE WERE MARRIED.

363
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,796

364
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,298
OH, MY GOD, YOU ARE SO PARANOID.

365
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,299
AM I?

366
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:20,800
YES.

367
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,802
AMI?

368
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,303
I CAN'T SPEAK FOR EMILY

369
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,306
BUT SUSAN IS IN A LOVING, COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP.

370
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,809
UH HUH, CAROL, SO WERE WE.

371
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,312
ALL RIGHT, JUST IMAGINE, FOR A MOMENT

372
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,816
THAT SUSAN MEETS SOMEONE, AND THEY REALLY HIT IT OFF.

373
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,318
SAY THEY'RE COMING BACK FROM THE THEATER

374
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,821
AND THEY STOP AT A PUB FOR A COUPLE OF DRINKS.

375
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,323
THEY'RE LAUGHING, YOU KNOW.

376
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,826
SOMEONE INNOCENTLY TOUCHES SOMEONE ELSE.

377
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,328
THERE'S ELECTRICITY.

378
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,330
IT'S NEW, IT'S EXCITING.

379
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,331
ARE YOU TELLING ME

380
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,334
THERE ISN'T EVEN THE SLIGHTEST POSSIBILITY

381
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,837
OF SOMETHING HAPPENING?

382
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,338
MAYBE.

383
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,339
OH, MY GOD!

384
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,842
I DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE IT UNTIL YOU SAID IT!

385
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,849
...AND EVEN THOUGH NONE OF THE KIDS BELIEVED ME

386
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,851
I SWEAR TO GOD, THAT DUCK PUSHED ME.

387
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,352
YEAH.

388
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,355
WOW, THIS PLACE IS FABULOUS!

389
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,857
LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND.

390
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,358
THIS IS THE DOWNSTAIRS LIVING ROOM...

391
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,360
WHAT? THERE'S TWO LIVING ROOMS?

392
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,862
GOD, GROWING UP HERE

393
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,364
THIS PLACE MUST HAVE BEEN A REAL BABE MAGNET.

394
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,867
YEAH, WELL, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

395
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,869
BUT MY PARENTS JUST MOVED HERE.

396
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,370
OH, WELL, YOU SHOULD KNOW

397
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,372
THIS PLACE IS A REAL BABE MAGNET.

398
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,874
WANT TO MAKE OUT?

399
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,878
HERE'S AN IDEA.

400
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,881
WHY DON'T I PUT THE FOOD IN THE FRIDGE

401
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,383
AND WE CAN EAT IT LATER?

402
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,886
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

403
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,889
UM, IS THERE A PLACE THAT I COULD GO FRESHEN UP?

404
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,890
YEAH, YEAH.

405
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,391
UM, JUST DOWN THE HALL

406
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,393
AND, UH, SECOND DOOR TO YOUR LEFT.

407
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,397
OH, HI, DARLING.

408
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,900
MOM, DAD! WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

409
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,401
WE CUT THE TRIP SHORT.

410
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,904
FRANCE SUCKS!

411
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,406
UM, THIS MAY BE A LITTLE WEIRD

412
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,408
BUT I... I'VE GOT A DATE HERE.

413
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:10,910
WELL, SAY NO MORE.

414
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,912
WE'LL GRAB SOME FOOD AND TAKE IT UPSTAIRS

415
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,413
AND BE OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

416
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,414
OH, THAT'D BE GREAT.

417
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,416
SO, YOU DIDN'T GET TO ITALY?

418
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,918
YEP. SUCKS!

419
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,444
HI, YOU.

420
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,947
OH, MY GOD...

421
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:48,948
I KNOW.

422
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,450
I CAN DO MORE THAN COOK.

423
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,953
UH...

424
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,458
I LIKE HER.

425
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,460
SHE SEEMS SMART.

426
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,465
UH... RACHEL, MY PARENTS.

427
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,466
OH, SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

OH, JOSHUA...

WHAT? TH TH THIS? NO.

433
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,980
OH, NO, THIS IS NOT...

434
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,482
THAT'S NOT WHAT... THAT'S NOT WHAT IT IS.

YOU SEE, OKAY, I WORK IN FASHION.

436
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,487

SEE, OH, PART OF MY JOB IS TO WEAR THE CLOTHES

441
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,496
AND THEN I SEE HOW PEOPLE RESPOND

442
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,998
AND THEN I REPORT BACK

443
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,000
TO MY SUPERIORS AT BLOOMINGDALE'S.

444
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,001

00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,516
SO, HAVE YOU KIDS EATEN YET?

452
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,518
WELL, WE WERE GOING TO DO THAT AFTER.

WELL, WE'RE STARVING.

456
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,024
WHY DON'T WE GET SOMETHING TO EAT?

457
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,025

WE'LL BE EATING AND, OF COURSE

00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,539
YOU'LL BE... WEARING THAT.

466
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,045
DUDE, I AM SORRY ABOUT WHAT I SAID.

467
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,047
NOPE. NOPE. YOU'RE RIGHT.

468
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,548
IT IS A RIDICULOUS NAME.

469
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,050
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

470
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,552
YES, IT IS.

471
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:37,056
FROM NOW ON, I HAVE NO FIRST NAME.

472
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,557
SO...

473
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,559
YOU'RE JUST BING?

474
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,064
I HAVE NO NAME.

475
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,566
ALL RIGHT, SO, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO CALL YOU?

476
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,069
OKAY, UH, FOR NOW, TEMPORARILY

477
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,570
YOU CAN CALL ME...

478
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,072
CLINT.

479
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,573

480
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,076
NO WAY ARE YOU COOL ENOUGH TO PULL OFF CLINT.

481
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,579
OKAY, SO, WHAT NAME AM I COOL ENOUGH TO PULL OFF?

482
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,581
UM... GENE.

483
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,585
IT'S CLINT.

484
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,586
IT'S CLINT!

485
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,589
SEE YOU LATER, GENE. BYE, GENE.

486
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,592
IT'S CLINT!

487
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,094
CLINT!

488
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,598
WHAT'S UP WITH GENE?

489
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,602
 YOU WORE YOUR NIGHTIE

490
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,104
TO DINNER?

491
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,105
OH, YEAH.

492
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,606
AND, UH, THE BEST PART, THOUGH

493
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,609
WAS WHEN THE, UH, WAITER SPILLED WATER DOWN MY BACK.

494
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,611
I JUMPED UP AND MY BOOB POPPED OUT.

495
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,613
OH, MY GOD. OH, NO.

496
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,615
IT'S ALL RIGHT-- I GOT NICE BOOBS.

497
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,121
SO, I JUST PICKED UP A MESSAGE FROM EMILY.

498
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,624
SHE AND SUSAN ARE GOING TO A POETRY READING TOGETHER.

499
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:46,625
SO?

500
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,127
SO?

501
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,129
POETRY?

502
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,131
SUSAN'S GAY.

503
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,133
THEY'RE BEING GAY TOGETHER!

504
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,136
EMILY'S STRAIGHT.

505
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,637
OH, WAKE UP!

506
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,141
WOW...

507
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,643
CAROL REALLY MESSED YOU UP.

508
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,145
EXCUSE ME?

509
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,147
YEAH, SHE TURNED YOU

510
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:13,152
INTO THIS THIS THIS UNTRUSTING, CRAZY, JEALOUS SYCOPHANT.

511
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,157
ALL RIGHT, SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT "SYCOPHANT" MEANS

512
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,159
BUT THE REST IS RIGHT.

513
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,161
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

514
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,662
I AM NOT A CRAZY, JEALOUS PERSON.

515
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,664
HUH.

516
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,166
WHAT?

517
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,667
SHE'S TOTALLY RIGHT.

518
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,169
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER

519
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,670
YOU GOT ALL FREAKED OUT ABOUT MARK

520
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,172
AND THERE WAS NOTHING GOING ON.

521
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,673
THIS TOTALLY MAKES SENSE.

522
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,175
IT DOES NOT.

523
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,676
OL SURE IT DOES -- IN HIGH SCHO

524
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,178
YOU WEREN'T JEALOUS AT ALL

525
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,180
EVEN THOUGH ALL YOUR GIRLFRIENDS

526
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,681
WERE CHEATING ON YOU.

527
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,682

528
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,683
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT

529
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,686
SO, UP UNTIL 92, 93, HE WAS VERY TRUSTING.

530
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,188
THEN 94 HIT, CAROL LEFT HIM

531
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,190
AND BAM, PARANOID CITY.

532
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,192
 YEP. ABSOLUTELY.

533
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,193
ABSOLUTELY.

534
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,194
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.

535
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,697
THIS IS NOT FUN!

536
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,698
ALL RIGHT, LOOK...

537
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,700
ALL WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS

538
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,702
DON'T LET WHAT HAPPENED WITH CAROL

539
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,205
RUIN WHAT YOU'VE GOT WITH EMILY.

540
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,209
THE 92 ROSS WOULDN'T.

541
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,711
THANKS.

542
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,215
STILL THINK I WAS RIGHT

543
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,717
ABOUT THAT WHOLE MARK THING THOUGH.

544
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,719
WHA... YA... WHA... YOU KNOW WHAT?

545
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,721
I HOPE EMILY IS A LESBIAN.

546
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,726

547
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,229
DRUMROLL.

548
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,732
OKAY, OKAY...

549
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,234
ALL RIGHT.

550
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,735
HELP.

551
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,239
AM I A MARK OR A JOHN?

552
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,243
WELL, YOU'RE NOT TALL ENOUGH TO BE A MARK...

553
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,246
BUT YOU MIGHT MAKE A GOOD BARNEY.

554
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,248
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I'M SERIOUS, OKAY?

555
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,249
TOMORROW AT 3:30

556
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,251
I'M GOING DOWN TO THE COURTHOUSE.

557
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,253
YOU'LL ACTUALLY  GO THROUGH WITH THIS?

558
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,756
HEY, LOOK, THIS NAME HAS BEEN HOLDING ME BACK MY ENTIRE LIFE.

559
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,259
OKAY, IT'S PROBABLY WHY KIDS PICKED ON ME IN SCHOOL

560
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,261
AND WHY I NEVER DO WELL WITH WOMEN.

599
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,841
OH, SO DID I.

00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,844
THERE'S NO TONGUE.
