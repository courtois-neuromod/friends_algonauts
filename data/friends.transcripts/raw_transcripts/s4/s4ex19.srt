00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,018
?? THE SKY IS CLEAR ??

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,021
?? THE MORNING'S HERE ??

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,522
?? THE MORNING'S HERE... ??

7
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,524
HEY!

8
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,526
DO YOU HAVE TO DO THAT?

9
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,528
IT'S SATURDAY!

10
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,030
OH, COME ON.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,032

I HATE THIS APARTMENT!

17
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,547

18
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,049
I HATE THE COLOR OF THESE WALLS.

19
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,551
I HATE THE FACT THIS PLACE STILL SMELLS LIKE BIRD.

20
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,555
I HATE THAT SINGING GUY.

21
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,057
ARE YOU KIDDING?

22
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,059
I LOVE THAT GUY.

23
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,561

I WILL KILL YOU.

27
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,070
GOD.

28
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,572
I HATE THE FACT THAT MY ROOM IS SO SMALL.

29
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,074
HEY, I HAVE ALL THE SPACE I NEED.

30
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,075
JUST DO WHAT I DID.

31
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,577
MONICA, YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A BED.

32
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,079
YOU SLEEP IN A BALL ON THE FLOOR.

33
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,580
YOU KNOW WHAT?

34
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,083
I AM REALLY TIRED OF YOUR BELLYACHING, OKAY?

35
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,085
I'VE WORKED REALLY HARD AT MAKING THIS

36
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,087
A NICE PLACE FOR US TO LIVE.

37
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,088
I KNOW.

38
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,089
I'M SO SORRY.

39
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,591
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

40
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,093
SEE, THIS IS A GREAT APARTMENT.

41
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,095
SHUT UP! THIS PLACE IS A HOLE!

54
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,149
OH, BLIMEY!

55
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,151
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'VE GOT AN EARRING.

56
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,652
I KNOW, I KNOW. WHO AM  I:

57
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,654
DAVID BOWIE?

58
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,158
HE DOES THAT?

59
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,160
I DON'T KNOW. WHATEVER.

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,663
I THINK IT MAKES YOU LOOK REALLY DANGEROUS.

61
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,165
OH, I KNOW.

62
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,667
YOU KNOW WHAT?

63
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,669
I NEVER WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THIS

64
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,171
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU.

65
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,672
NO, REALLY.

66
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,675
WHEN I'M WITH YOU, I'M LIKE THIS THIS WHOLE OTHER GUY.

67
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,677
I LOVE THAT GUY.

68
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,180
I MEAN, I LOVE YOU, TOO, A LOT

69
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,182
BUT THAT GUY.

70
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,183
I LOVE THAT GUY.

71
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,684
I LOVE BOTH OF YOU.

72
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,685
YEAH?

73
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,688

74
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,191
I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO GO.

75
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,692
THEN DON'T.

76
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,693
STAY HERE.

77
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,695
JUST DON'T GO SO SOON TO LONDON.

78
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,197
JUST ONE MORE DAY.

79
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,699
OH, ROSS, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS TO ME AGAIN. ONE MORE DAY.

80
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,201
YOU KNOW I'D STAY IN A MINUTE

81
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,203
BUT I'VE ALREADY MISSED SO MUCH OF MY WORK

82
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,704
THEY'D FIRE ME.

83
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,208
SO? THEN YOU COULD STAY AS LONG AS YOU WANT.

84
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,709
I WISH I COULD.

85
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,713
OH, NO, DON'T DON'T. .. DON'T START PACKING.

86
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,216
COME ON.

87
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,221
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND PACKING.

88
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,225
LOOK, I JUST DON'T WANT TO LEAVE IT TILL THE LAST MINUTE.

89
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,228
THE LAST TIME I PACKED IN A RUSH, I LEFT MY KNICKERS.

90
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,229
YEAH, I KNOW.

91
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,231
I, UH, I TRIED THEM ON.

92
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,233
YOU DIDN'T!

93
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,234
NO, I DIDN'T.

94
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,735
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE THAT GUY.

95
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,741

96
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,746
HELLO.

97
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,749
HO, HO, HO!

98
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,751
EXCUSE ME?

99
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,753
YOUR PANTS.

100
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,754
OH, YEAH!

101
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,755
YOU LIKE THEM?

102
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,757
I WENT TO A USED CLOTHES STORE

103
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,759
AND GOT, LIKE, A BUNCH OF MATERNITY STUFF.

104
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,262
THESE ARE SO COMFORTABLE.

105
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:28,768
UH, PHEEBS, THOSE ARE SANTA PANTS.

106
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,270
WHAT?

107
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,272
SANTA PANTS.

108
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,774
SANTA CLAUS'S PANTS.

109
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,775
NUH UH.

110
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,778
THEY'RE MATERNITY PANTS.

111
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,780
THEY EVEN CAME WITH A LIST OF BABY NAMES.

112
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,282
SEE?

113
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,286
THESE NAMES ARE GOOD AND THESE ARE BAD.

114
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,787
OH.

115
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,790
HEY.

116
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,791
HEY.

117
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,293
HEY, PHEEBS.

118
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,296
S? SO, HOW ARE THE ELVE

119
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,797
I DON'T KNOW.

120
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,799
HOW ARE THE...

121
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,301
YOU KNOW.

122
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,304
YOUR CLOTHES AREN'T FUNNY.

123
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,309
HEY, GUYS, WHAT SHOULD I WEAR TO A KNICKS GAME?

124
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,312
UH, A T SHIRT THAT SAYS, "I DON'T BELONG HERE."

125
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,815
YOU HAVE KNICKS TICKETS?

126
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,816
YEAH. MY MOM GOT MY DAD'S

127
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,318
SEASON TICKETS IN THE DIVORCE

128
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,819
SO SHE JUST GAVE THEM TO ME.

129
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,821
APPARENTLY, THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD SEATS.

130
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,323
OH, MY GOD!

131
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,825
THESE ARE ALMOST RIGHT ON THE FLOOR!

132
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,328
I COULD SLIP WOODY ALLEN MY RESUME.

133
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,330
DO YOU GUYS WANT THESE?

134
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,333
YEAH! YEAH, WE DO!

135
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,834








OH, WELL, YOU GOT THEM.

136
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,335
ALL RIGHT!

137
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,836
JUST GIVE US

138
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,340
OUR APARTMENT BACK.

139
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,343
WHOA! I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.

140
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,845
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

141
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,347
COME ON.

142
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,849
WE KNOW WHAT THESE ARE WORTH.

143
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,352
WHAT, DO YOU THINK WE'RE STUPID?

144
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,353
NOT STUPID.

145
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,855
YOU'RE MEANER THAN I THOUGHT.

146
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,357
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

147
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,858
FORGET IT, OKAY?

148
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,860
I'M NOT GIVING  UP MY BACHELOR PAD

149
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,362
FOR SOME BASKETBALL SEATS.

150
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,864
YOUR BACHELOR PAD?

151
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,367
HAVE YOU EVEN HAD A GIRL UP HERE?

152
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,370
NO.

153
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,372
BUT, UH... JOEY HAS

154
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,375
AND I USUALLY TALK TO THEM IN THE MORNING TIME.

155
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,379
YEAH, YOU DO.

156
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,886
COME ON.

157
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,390
YES, GUNTHER, CAN I GET TWO CUPS OF CHINO, PLEASE?

158
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,393
GOOD ONE.

159
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,894
HEY, COME ON-- SEASON TICKETS.

160
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:35,895
SEASON TICKETS.

161
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,397
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

162
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,399
FORGET IT. I'M NOT GIVING UP THE APARTMENT.

163
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,401
LOOK, WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID

164
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,403
MY DAD'S COMPANY GAVE SEASON TICKETS

165
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,905
TO THE NUMBER ONE SALESMAN EVERY YEAR.

166
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,907
MY DAD NEVER WON.

167
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,410
OF COURSE, HE WASN'T IN THE SALES DIVISION

168
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,912
BUT STILL, I NEVER EVER, EVER FORGOT THAT.

169
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:54,914
HEY, GUYS.

170
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:55,915
HEY.

171
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,918
OH, MY GOD.

172
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,422
WE DON'T MAKE ENOUGH FUN OF YOU ALREADY?

173
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,923
OH, YEAH.

174
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,925
EMILY CONVINCED ME TO DO IT.

175
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,429
YOU DO KNOW THAT WHAM! BROKE UP?

176
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,931

177
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,434
YEAH, WELL, I LIKE  IT AND EMILY LIKES IT

178
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,935
AND THAT'S WHAT COUNTS.

179
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,939
SO, UH, HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

180
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,442
DON'T TRY AND TALK ALL NORMAL

181
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,444
WITH THAT THING IN YOUR EAR.

182
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,945
WHERE'S EMILY?

183
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,448
SHE'S SAYING GOOD BYE TO HER UNCLE.

184
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,950
MAN, DIDN'T SHE, LIKE, JUST GET HERE?

185
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,452
YEAH! YEAH!

186
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,953
EASY, TIGER.

187
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,955
I JUST... I HATE THIS SO MUCH.

188
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,458
I MEAN, EVERY TIME I GO PICK HER UP AT THE AIRPORT

189
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,460
IT'S SO GREAT, BUT AT THE SAME TIME

190
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,463
I'M THINKING, WELL, I'M GOING TO BE RIGHT BACK THERE

191
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,465
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS DROPPING HER OFF.

192
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,966
SO, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

193
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,967
THERE'S NOTHING TO DO.

194
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,969
I MEAN, SHE LIVES THERE, I LIVE HERE.

195
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,972
I MEAN, SHE'D HAVE TO MOVE HERE.

196
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,974
SHE SHOULD MOVE HERE.

197
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,976
WHAT?

198
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,478
I COULD ASK HER TO LIVE WITH ME.

199
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,479
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

200
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,481
WHY NOT? I MEAN, WHY NOT?

201
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,483
BECAUSE YOU'VE ONLY KNOWN HER SIX WEEKS.

202
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,485
OKAY, I'VE GOT A CARTON OF MILK IN MY REFRIGERATOR

203
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,986
I'VE HAD A LONGER RELATIONSHIP WITH.

204
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:11,491
BUT, GUYS, WHEN I'M WITH HER, IT'S LIKE...

205
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,494
SHE BRINGS OUT THIS THIS THIS GREAT SIDE OF ME.

206
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,997
I MEAN, I LOVE HER, YOU KNOW?

207
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,999
AND I LOVE THE MILK!

208
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,501
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO ASK

209
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,503
SOME BRITISH GIRL TO MOVE IN WITH ME.

210
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,511
JOEY, YOU SAY THINGS NOW.

211
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,013
LOOK, ROSS, HE'S RIGHT.

212
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,014
EMILY IS GREAT.

213
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,516
SHE'S GREAT

214
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,017
BUT THIS IS WAY TOO SOON.

215
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,519
YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO SCARE HER.

216
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,021
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. NO.

217
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,523
YOU DON'T WANT TO WRECK IT.

218
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,024
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TOO FAST.

219
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,026
YEAH. NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

220
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,028
I KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT.

221
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,030
I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT.

222
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,532
THANKS, GUYS.

223
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,533
OKAY, NO PROBLEM.

224
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,535
JUST REMEMBER TO WAKE US UP

225
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,037
BEFORE YOU GO GO.

226
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,548
OH, IT'S TOO HARD.

227
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,550
TOO HARD!

228
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,051
ALL RIGHT, BOYS--

229
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,053
LAST CHANCE FOR THE TICKETS.

230
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:18,057
OTHERWISE, I GIVE THEM TO MY NEW BOYFRIEND JOSHUA.

231
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,059
NO, THANK YOU.

232
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,562
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

233
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,564
COME ON, COME ON-- LET'S TRADE.

234
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,565
THE TIMING'S PERFECT.

235
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,066
I JUST CLOGGED THE TOILET!

236
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,569
LOOK, I WANT THOSE BASKETBALL SEATS

237
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,070
AS MUCH AS YOU DO, OKAY?

238
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,573
BUT WE CAN'T LIVE IN THE SMALL APARTMENT

239
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,074
AFTER WE'VE LIVED HERE!

240
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,577
 DIDN'T YOU EVER READ FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON?

241
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,578
YES...

242
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,581
DIDN'T YOU EVER READ SPORTS ILLUSTRATED?

243
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,083
NO, I DIDN'T READ YOURS.

244
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,086
LOOK, COME ON, WE CAN GO TO THE GAME TONIGHT.

245
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,589
LOOK, THE ONLY WAY I WILL EVEN CONSIDER THIS

246
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,592
IS IF THEY OFFER A LOT MORE THAN JUST SEASON SEATS.

247
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,093
BUT IT'S THE KNICKS!

248
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,095
KS! SCREW THE KNIC

249
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,097
WHOA...

250
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,100
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

251
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,102
I JUST MEANT

252
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,606
THAT THE APARTMENT IS WORTH SO MUCH MORE.

253
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,107
HUH.

254
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,110
AND THE KNICKS RULE ALL.

255
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,113
YEAH! THE KNICKS RULE ALL.

256
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,115
HEY, SO ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT?

257
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,617
NO. NO, WE'RE NOT.

258
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,618
YOU KNOW WHY?

259
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,620
BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN EVEN TRADE.

260
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,123
ALL RIGHT, OKAY, LOOK, WHAT IF YOU COULD KEEP THE APARTMENT

261
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,124
AND GET THE TICKETS?

262
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,126
DONE!

263
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,628
LET ME FINISH.

264
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,630
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A BET-- WINNER TAKES ALL.

265
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,131
WE COULD END UP WITH NOTHING.

266
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,633
OR YOU CAN END  UP WITH EVERYTHING.

267
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,134
OOH, I LIKE THAT.

268
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,637
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

269
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,639
NO! OH, JUST DO IT!

270
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,641
OH! OH, I'M CONVINCED.

271
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,644
COME ON, MAN.

272
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,646
YOU KNOW I'D DO IT FOR YOU.

273
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,648
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

274
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,149

275
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,152
ALL RIGHT, BUT YOU CAN'T USE THAT AGAIN

276
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,153
FOR A WHOLE YEAR.

277
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,154
I'M IN.

278
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,156
OOH! THIS IS SO EXCITING!

279
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,158
OH, GOD, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BET?

280
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,661
OH, OKAY. WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD

281
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,662
LET PHOEBE DECIDE

282
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,665
BECAUSE SHE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO'S IMPARTIAL

283
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,166
AND SHE'S SO PRETTY.

284
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,668
OKAY.

285
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,169
UM... OOH, OOH...

286
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,671
OH, I HAVE A GAME!

287
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,672
OH, THIS IS GREAT!

288
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,674
WHAT'S THE GAME, WHAT'S THE GAME?

289
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,175
UM, WELL, IT DOESN'T HAVE A NAME.

290
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,177
BUT NO, OKAY: "PHOEBE BALL."

291
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,679

292
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,681
NO, IT DOESN'T HAVE A NAME.

293
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,182
UM...

294
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,686
OKAY, MONICA, WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE THING

295
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,688
ABOUT TREES?

296
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,691
THEY'RE GREEN?

297
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,192
GOOD! GOOD! FIVE POINTS!

298
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,194
ALL RIGHT!

299
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,197
 GREAT! ALL RIGHT

300
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,699
JOEY...

301
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,701
SAME QUESTION.

302
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,702
UH...

303
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,704
OH!

304
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,705
HMM. THEY'RE TALL.

305
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,206
OOH! THREE POINTS.

306
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,209
NO. BOTH FINE ANSWERS

307
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,712
BUT WE WERE LOOKING FOR "LEAFY."

308
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,213
"LEAFY."

309
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,217
THAT'S NOT EVEN A GAME.

310
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,719
SHUT UP!

311
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,220
WE'RE WINNING.

312
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,222
YOU WANT TO FINISH THIS RIGHT NOW?

313
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,223
WE GET A DECK OF CARDS.

314
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,725
HIGH CARD WINS.

315
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,726
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

316
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,727
FINE. LET'S DO IT.

317
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,728
OOH! I HAVE CARDS.

318
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,729
OH, GOOD.

319
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,230
YEAH! HERE.

320
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,732
OH, NO. THESE ARE THE TRICK DECK.

321
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,733
OKAY... HERE, YES.

322
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,234
OKAY.

323
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,236
OKAY, YOU GUYS... YOU GUYS PICK FIRST.

324
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,237
OKAY.

325
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,743
FOUR.

326
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,745
YES! THAT'S A LOW ONE NAH!

327
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,748
ALL RIGHT.

328
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,749
PHOEBE, YOU LOOK.

329
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,250
I CAN'T DO IT.

330
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,752
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I CAN?!

331
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,753
OKAY, OKAY.

332
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,754
ACE!

333
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,758

334
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,260
WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING AND HUGGING?

335
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,762
WELL, BECAUSE WE WON OUR APARTMENT BACK!

336
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,763
 WHAT?

337
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,766
ACE IS HIGH: JACK, QUEEN, KING, ACE.

338
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,769
NO, ACE IS LOW: ACE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

339
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,778
I DON'T KNOW.

340
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,780
BUT, BUT, OOH!

341
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,281
OOH!

342
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,283
LOOK IT! AH!

343
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,287
PICK AGAIN, PICK AGAIN!

00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,789
ALL RIGHT, GIMME, GIMME.

00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,290
OKAY. OKAY.

00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,297

350
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,799
I KNOW QUEEN IS HIGH!

351
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,802
AH, NOT AS HIGH AS...

352
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,303
IT WORKED! KING!

353
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,805
WE WIN!

354
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,806

355
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,308
WE PICK AGAIN, WE PICK AGAIN!

356
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,810
WHY? I DON'T KNOW.

357
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,313
TICKETS, PLEASE.

358
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,315

359
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,817
THAT'S COURT SIDE, BABY!

360
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,819
YEAH!

361
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,320
SERIOUSLY, GOOD GAME, THOUGH!

362
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,321
GOOD GAME...

363
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,324
WHAT ARE THEY SO MAD ABOUT?

364
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,826
THEY GOT THE APARTMENT BACK.

365
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:49,829
NO, THEY DIDN'T.

366
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,331

367
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,839
HEY.

368
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,341
PACKED WHILE YOU WERE GONE.

369
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,844
I LEFT SOME KNICKERS UNDER YOUR PILLOW.

370
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,347
MOVE IN WITH ME.

371
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,349
WHAT?

372
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,851
DON'T BE SCARED.

373
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,853
I I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY

374
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,355
AND PEOPLE WILL SAY IT'S TOO SOON

375
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,857
BUT JUST, JUST THINK.

376
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,359
THINK HOW GREAT IT WOULD BE.

377
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,361
OH...

378
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,864
OW. I DON'T KN

379
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,865

380
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,867
OH, LEAVING LONDON. UH...

381
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,869
MY WHOLE FAMILY LIVES THERE.

382
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,370
MY JOB.

383
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,872
WELL, SO YOU'LL GET A JOB HERE.

384
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,373
I MEAN, I'M ALWAYS HEARING

385
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,376
ABOUT THEM FOREIGNERS COMING IN AND STEALING AMERICAN JOBS.

386
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,377
THAT COULD BE YOU.

387
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,380
YEAH, BUT I IT'S MY WHOLE LIFE.

388
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,383
YOU COME TO ENGLAND.

389
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,384
NO, I CAN'T.

390
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,387
I WOULD, I REALLY WOULD, BUT MY SON IS HERE.

391
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,388
I CAN'T LEAVE HIM. ISN'T...?

392
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,390
YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY WAY?

393
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,393
SO. OH, I DON'T THINK

394
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,398
I MEAN, IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF IT WAS WAY INTO THE FUTURE

395
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,401
AND, AND WE WERE GETTING MARRIED, OR SOMETHING.

396
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,402
WHAT?

397
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,904
OH. NO. NO, RIGHT.

398
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,906
UH, I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID "MARRIED."

399
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,408
UH, PLEASE DON'T GET FREAKY ON ME.

400
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,911
UH... I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

401
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,412
I DIDN'T SAY IT. I TAKE IT BACK.

402
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,413
NO, NO, DON'T.

403
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,917
WHY DON'T WE?

404
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,419
WHY DON'T WE WHAT?

405
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,421

406
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,423
GET MARRIED.

407
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,926
YOU ARE MAD.

408
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:27,927
NO, NO! I'M NOT.

409
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,428
IT'S IT'S IT'S PERFECT!

410
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,931
I MEAN, IT'S BETTER THAN YOU JUST MOVING HERE

411
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,432
BECAUSE IT'S US TOGETHER FOREVER

412
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,434
AND THAT'S, THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

413
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,937
WE'VE ONLY KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR SIX WEEKS.

414
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,938
I KNOW. SO WHAT?

415
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,439
I MEAN, WHO'S TO SAY?

416
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,942
DOES THAT MEAN WE, WE CAN'T DO IT?

417
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,944
LOOK, I WAS WITH CAROL FOR FOUR YEARS

418
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,445
BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED

419
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,949
AND I WOUND UP DIVORCED FROM A PREGNANT LESBIAN.

420
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,452
I MEAN, THIS...

421
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,956
THIS MAKES SENSE FOR US.

422
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,958
COME ON!

423
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,959
I MEAN, OUR FIRST DATE

424
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,962
WE ENDED UP SPENDING THE WHOLE WEEKEND IN VERMONT.

425
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,964
I MEAN, LAST NIGHT, I GOT MY EAR PIERCED.

426
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:05,965
ME!

427
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,466

428
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,969
IT JUST FEELS RIGHT.

429
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,470
DOESN'T IT?

430
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,474
MY PARENTS ARE GOING TO BE REALLY MAD.

431
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,976
IS THAT... ARE YOU SAYING "YES"?

432
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,477
IS THAT "YES"?

433
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,979
YES.

434
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,482
YES!

435
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,984
YES? WE'RE GETTING...?

436
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:25,985
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED?

437
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,987
OH, MY GOD!

438
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,488
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED!

439
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,489
WE, WE...

440
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,992
COME HERE, COME HERE.

441
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,498
OW!

442
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,503
EMILY, WILL YOU MARRY ME?

443
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,506
YES.

444
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,012
OH, IT'S A BIT SMALL.

445
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:57,516
DAMN! I THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING TO BE ROMANTIC AS HELL.

446
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,021
IT WAS.

447
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,034
THOSE WERE, LIKE, THE BEST SEATS EVER.

448
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,037
OH, YEAH. HEY! SHOULD WE GIVE THESE SHIRTS TO THE GIRLS

449
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,039
YOU KNOW, KIND OF LIKE A PEACE OFFERING?

450
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,040
OH, YEAH. THAT'S VERY NICE.

451
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,542
PLUS, YOU KNOW, THEY WERE FREE AND THEY'RE TOO SMALL.

452
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,549
OH... OH, GOD!

453
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,057
HEY, YOU WANT A BEER?

454
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,560
WHOA!

455
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,062
I KNOW!

456
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,068
OPEN UP! OPEN UP! OPEN UP!

457
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,071
WE'LL DISCUSS IT IN THE MORNING.

458
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,081
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

459
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,085
WE TOOK OUR APARTMENT BACK.

460
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,090
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

461
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,095
OKAY. IT WAS MY IDEA

462
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,098
BUT I DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.

463
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,099
OH! OH!

464
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,603
WE ARE SWITCHING BACK RIGHT NOW.

465
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,604
NO, WE'RE NOT.

466
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,106
WE'RE NOT LEAVING.

467
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,607
WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE SOMETIME

468
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,109
BECAUSE YOU BOTH HAVE JOBS

469
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,610
AND AS SOON AS YOU DO, WE'RE SWITCHING IT BACK.

470
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,112
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO STOP US.

471
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,113
RIGHT, JOE?

472
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,115
I DON'T KNOW. I...

473
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,619
WHAT?!

474
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,621
I DON'T WANT TO MOVE AGAIN.

475
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,623

476
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,125
I DON'T CARE.

477
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,627
THIS IS OUR APARTMENT AND THEY STOLE--

478
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,130
YOU STOLE!-- OUR APARTMENT.

479
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,133
WE WON THAT APARTMENT FAIR AND SQUARE TWICE

480
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,135
AND I AM GETTING IT BACK RIGHT NOW.

481
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,138
I'M GETTING IT BACK RIGHT NOW!

482
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,140
ALL RIGHT...

483
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,643
WE FIGURED YOU MIGHT RESPOND THIS WAY

484
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,645
SO WE HAVE A BACKUP OFFER.

485
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,647
OH, NO, NO, NO. NO MORE OFFERS.

486
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,149
YOU CAN'T OFFER ANYTHING TO US.

487
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,152
LET US KEEP THE APARTMENT AND...

488
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,653
AS A THANK YOU...

489
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,658
RACHEL AND I WILL KISS FOR ONE MINUTE.

490
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,664
TOTALLY WORTH IT.

491
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,666
THAT WAS ONE GOOD MINUTE.

492
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,667
GOOD NIGHT.

493
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,169
GOOD NIGHT.

494
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,674
MEN ARE SUCH IDIOTS.

495
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,176
I KNOW. CAN YOU BELIEVE

496
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,677
SOMETHING THAT STUPID

497
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,180
ACTUALLY GOT US OUR APARTMENT BACK?

498
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,682
IT'S SO FUNNY TO THINK--

499
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,185
IF YOU HAD JUST DONE THAT RIGHT AFTER THE LAST CONTEST

500
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,187
NO ONE WOULD'VE HAD TO MOVE AT ALL.

501
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,691
L L LET'S PRETEND THAT'S NOT TRUE.

502
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,693
YEAH.

503
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,698
OKAY... SCARF'S DONE.

504
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,202
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

505
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,703
OKAY.

506
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,205
HI.

507
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,206
HEY. HEY.

508
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,707
WHAT'S GOING ON?

509
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,210
ROSS HAS SOME BIG THING TO TELL EVERYONE.

510
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,711
UH... UH, OKAY...

511
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,213

00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,225
OH! ARE YOU PREGNANT, TOO?

516
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,228
UH, NO.

517
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,230

00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,734
WE WE JUST DECIDED TO... TO GO FOR IT.

520
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,736
I MEAN, WE KNOW IT'S A BIT HASTY

521
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,238
BUT, UH...

00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,741

OH, I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,761
WELL, YEAH... CONGRATULATIONS.

I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED.

00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,773
YEAH.

00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,779
