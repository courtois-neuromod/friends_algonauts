1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,505
NEW WALLET, HUH?

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,007
YEAH. IT WAS TIME.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,009
THE OLD CONDOM RING IN THE LEATHER

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,510
JUST DOESN'T SAY "COOL"

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,511
ANYMORE, YOU KNOW?

6
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,014
RACHEL, YOU JUST PUT AN EMPTY CARTON

7
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,515
BACK IN THE FRIDGE.

8
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,017
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT THE GARBAGE

9
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,518
WAS FULL.

10
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,520
HAVE YOU EVER TAKEN OUT THE TRASH?

11
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,522
YEAH.

12
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,025
SINCE YOU'VE LIVED HERE?

13
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,027
WELL, I, UH... THOUGHT

14
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,529
YOU LIKE DDOING IT.

15
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,035
THIRD DOOR ON THE LEFT.

16
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,036
RIGHT.

17
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,047
OH, HEY, MR. TREEGER.

18
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,548
HEY.

19
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,068
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,070
UM...

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,571
OH! OH!

22
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,574
SORRY.

23
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,076
IT'S A LITTLE OLD, BUT...

24
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,577
YOU'RE CLOGGING  UP THE CHUTE

25
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,580
I JUST SPENT A HALF HOUR UNCLOGGING.

26
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,582
OH, I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T...

27
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,085
I DON'T COME IN HERE A LOT.

28
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,586
OF COURSE YOU DON'T.

29
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,088
BECAUSE YOU'RE A LITTLE PRINCESS.

30
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,091
"DADDY, BUY ME A PIZZA."

31
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,093
"DADDY, BUY ME A CANDY FACTORY."

32
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,594
"DADDY, MAKE THE CAST OF CATS

33
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,096
SING 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY' TO ME."

34
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,098
BUT I...

35
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,100
YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST MAKE A MESS

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,102
THE BIG MAN IN THE COVERALLS

37
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,104
WILL COME AND CLEAN IT UP, HUH?

38
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,605
WHY DON'T YOU THINK

39
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,607
OF SOMEONE ELSE FOR A CHANGE?

40
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,612
OKAY. I'M SORRY.

41
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,119

42
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,122
GOD! IF YOU'RE GOING TO CRY ABOUT IT...

43
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,624

56
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,673
WHOA! TREEGER MADE YOU CRY?

57
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,674
YES.

58
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,676
HE SAID REALLY MEAN THINGS

59
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,179
THAT WERE ONLY PARTLY TRUE.

60
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:03,183
I'M GOING TO GO DOWN THERE AND TEACH THAT GUY A LESSON.

61
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,185
PLEASE, IT'S BEST IF WE FORGET ABOUT IT.

62
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,187
THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

63
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,689
YOU WEREN'T ALMOST JUST KILLED.

64
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,690
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

65
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,692
SCHOOL IS IN SESSION!

66
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,198
YOU GUYS, IS THIS A GYM CARD?

67
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,200
OH, YEAH. GYM MEMBER.

68
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,702
I TRY TO GO FOUR TIMES A WEEK

69
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,705
BUT I'VE MISSED THE LAST 1,200 TIMES.

70
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,209
SO WHY DON'T YOU QUIT?

71
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,710
YOU DON'T THINK I'VE TRIED?

72
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,714
YOU THINK I LIKE

73
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,218
HAVING $50 DOLLARS TAKEN OUT OF MY BANK ACCOUNT EVERY MONTH?

74
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,720
THEY MAKE YOU GO ALL THE WAY DOWN THERE.

75
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,224
THEN THEY USE ALL THESE PHRASES AND PEPPINESS

76
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,725
TO TRY TO CONFUSE YOU.

77
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,727
AND THEN THEY BRING OUT MARIA.

78
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,730
WHO IS MARIA?

79
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,233
AH, MARIA...

80
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,734
YOU CAN'T SAY NO TO HER.

81
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,739
SHE'S LIKE THIS LYCRA, SPANDEX COVERED GYM TREAT.

82
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,742
YOU NEED ME TO GO DOWN THERE WITH YOU

83
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,244
AND HOLD YOUR HAND?

84
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,745
NO.

85
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,747
YOU'RE STRONG ENOUGH TO FACE HER ALONE?

86
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,748
OH, NO.

87
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,750
YOU'LL HAVE TO COME.

88
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,256
TRIBBIANI.

89
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,758
HOLD ON. I'LL GET THE PLUNGER.

90
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:22,262
HEY, YOU HOLD ON, PAL.

91
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,763
NOW, YOU MADE MY FRIEND RACHEL CRY

92
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,765
SO NOW YOU'RE GOING TO GO UP THERE

93
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,267
AND YOU'RE GOING TO APOLOGIZE TO HER

94
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,269
UNLESS YOU WANT ME TO CALL THE LANDLORD.

95
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,770
AND TELL HIM WHAT?

96
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,773
MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF "NOT MAKING GIRLS CRY."

97
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,775
MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF A LITTLE SOMETHING

98
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,278
CALLED "THE RENT STABILIZATION ACT OF 1968."

99
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,781
I HAVE ACTUALLY NOT HEARD OF THAT.

100
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,784
YEAH? WELL, YOUR FRIENDS ARE IN VIOLATION OF IT.

101
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,786
I BEEN A NICE GUY UP UNTIL NOW

102
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,288
BUT I DON'T NEED THIS GRIEF.

103
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,290
I'M GOING TO CALL THE LANDLORD

104
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,293
AND TELL HIM THAT MONICA IS ILLEGALLY SUBLETTING

105
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,794
HER GRANDMOTHER'S APARTMENT.

106
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,297
YOUR FRIENDS ARE OUT OF HERE, PAL.

107
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,801
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW?

108
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,308
PLEASE, SOMEBODY TELL ME I DON'T HAVE TO WORK TODAY.

109
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,309
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

110
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,810
MY FIRST MASSAGE

111
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,313
IS THIS INCREDIBLY GORGEOUS GUY

112
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,814
AND EVERY TIME I SEE HIM

113
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,317
I JUST WANT TO DO THINGS TO HIM

114
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,320
THAT I'M NOT ALLOWED TO CHARGE FOR.

115
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,822
SO DO THEM FOR FREE.

116
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:26,326
OH, NO. IT IS FORBIDDEN.

117
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:31,331
NO, NO. MRS. CARTER FIRES PEOPLE FOR MESSING AROUND WITH CLIENTS.

118
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,334
AND IT'S AGAINST MY OATH AS A MASSEUSE.

119
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,336
THEY MAKE YOU TAKE AN OATH?

120
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,338
NO. I MADE MYSELF TAKE ONE.

121
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,840
YEAH, NO FOOLING AROUND WITH CLIENTS

122
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,343
AND, UM... ALWAYS BE PREPARED.

123
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,847
THAT ONE'S ACTUALLY FROM THE BOY SCOUTS

124
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,349
BUT IT JUST MAKES GOOD SENSE.

125
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,352
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GIVE HIM

126
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,853
TO SOMEBODY ELSE?

127
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,355
NO, I CAN HANDLE IT.

128
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,357
NO, I'M A PROFESSIONAL.

129
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,360
OH, PHEEBS, IS THAT A NEW ANKLE BRACELET?

130
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,362
AND YOU GOT A PEDICURE.

131
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,863
YOUR FEET ARE ALL DRESSED UP.

132
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,869
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY PART OF YOU HE CAN SEE

133
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,371
WHEN HE'S ON THE TABLE.

134
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,873
YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOME FEET FLIRTING.

135
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,376
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

136
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,880
THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE TOE RING?

137
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,885
BECAUSE IT'S ARABIAN PRINCESS DAY AT WORK, OKAY?

138
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,387
LEAVE ME ALONE.

139
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,892
OH!

140
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,893
MY HERO! WHAT HAPPENED?

141
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,395
WELL, UH...

142
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,896
I WENT DOWN AND TOLD HIM

143
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,898
NO ONE TREATS MY FRIENDS LIKE THAT

144
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,401
AND HE'D BETTER COME UP HERE AND APOLOGIZE.

145
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,902
WAIT A MINUTE.

146
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,404
WHAT DID HE SAY?

147
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,906
UH... HE SAID HE WASN'T GOING TO APOLOGIZE

148
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,409
BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE LIVING HERE ILLEGALLY.

149
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,412
INSTEAD, WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO IS HAVE YOU EVICTED.

150
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,913
WHAT? EVICTED?

151
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,915
I TOLD YOU NOT TO GO DOWN THERE.

152
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,417
HE MADE RACHEL CRY!

153
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,919
RACHEL ALWAYS CRIES!

154
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,421
THAT'S NOT TRUE!

155
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,423

156
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,425
JOEY, YOU GO DOWN THERE

157
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,427
AND YOU SUCK UP TO HIM.

158
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,428
I MEAN, YOU SUCK

159
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,430
LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SUCKED BEFORE!

160
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,931
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TRY.

161
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,435
BUT, IF I CAN'T, YOU STAY WITH CHANDLER AND I

162
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,936
UNTIL YOU GET SETTLED.

163
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,437
GO!

164
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,938
I'LL CHECK

165
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,939
WITH HIM FIRST

166
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,441
BUT I THINK HE'LL BE COOL.

167
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:21,941
JOEY!

168
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,947
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

169
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,949
NOW REMEMBER WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT:

170
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,451
YOU GOT TO BE STRONG.

171
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,453
YES.YES.

172
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,954
NOW ONE MORE TIME:

173
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,457
"HEY, DON'T YOU WANT A WASHBOARD STOMACH

174
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,958
AND ROCK HARD PECS?"

175
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,960
NO. I WANT A FLABBY GUT

176
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,962
AND SAGGY MAN BREASTS.

177
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,964
GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.

178
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,972
I WANT TO QUIT THE GYM.

179
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,974
YOU WANT TO QUIT?

180
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,480
I WANT TO QUIT THE GYM.

181
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,982
YOU DO REALIZE YOU WON'T HAVE ACCESS

182
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,485
TO OUR NEW FULL SERVICE SWEDISH SPA?

183
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,987

184
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,493
I WANT TO QUIT THE GYM.

185
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,997
OKAY. DAVE, IN THE MEMBERSHIP OFFICE, HANDLES QUITTERS.

186
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,000
EXCUSE ME.

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,502
ARE YOU A MEMBER?

188
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,504
ME?

189
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,005
NO.

190
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,507
SORRY. MEMBERS ONLY.

191
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,011
I WANT TO QUIT THE GYM.

192
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,013
IT'S OKAY, MAN. BE STRONG.

193
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,015

194
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,518

195
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,022
SO, ARE YOU A MEMBER OF ANY GYM?

196
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,024
NO, AND I'M NOT GOING TO BE

197
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,027
SO YOU CAN SAVE YOUR LITTLE SPEECH.

198
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,028
OKAY. NO PROBLEM.

199
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,030
COULD YOU COME HERE FOR A SECOND?

200
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,535
HI. I'M MARIA.

201
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,537
HI, M...

202
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,052
WOW, YOU HAVE REALLY PRETTY FEET.

203
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,055
THESE OLD THINGS?

204
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,059
WOULD YOU SPEND SOME TIME ON MY SCIATIC AREA?

205
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,561
IT'S BEEN KILLING ME TODAY.

206
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,063
YOU MEAN THE...

207
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,567
BY "SCIATIC," YOU MEAN THE...

208
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,569
TOWEL COVERED PORTION.

209
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,070
YEAH.

210
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,573
SURE. YEAH. NO, I CAN DO THAT...

211
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,074
YEAH. BECAUSE, UH...

212
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,577
YOU KNOW, USUALLY THE MUSCLES IN THE SCIATIC AREA

213
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,079
CAN GET, YOU KNOW, REAL NICE AND TIGHT.

214
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,585
YEAH. SO, UM.... TELL ME, RICK

215
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,588
HOW, UM... HOW DID YOU INJURE THE AREA?

216
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,090
OH, A 16 HOUR SIT IN FOR GREENPEACE.

217
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,592
OH.

218
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,102
OW!

219
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,604
DID YOU JUST BITE ME?

220
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,105
NO.

221
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,114
WHAT?

222
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,616
PLEASE DON'T KICK MONICA AND RACHEL OUT.

223
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,618
THIS WASN'T THEIR FAULT. IT WAS MINE.

224
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,620
SHOULD I KICK YOU GUYS OUT INSTEAD?

225
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,121
NO. YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

226
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,624
WHERE WOULD THE CHICK AND THE DUCK LIVE?

227
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,626
YOU HAVE PETS?

228
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,128
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

229
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,630
THOSE ARE, UH... NICKNAMES.

230
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,633
YEAH, I'M THE CHICK AND CHANDLER'S THE DUCK.

231
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,134
HUH. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT

232
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,136
IT WAS THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

233
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,638
COME ON, MAN.

234
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,140
JUST... JUST LET THE GIRLS STAY.

235
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,642
I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

236
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,143
REALLY?

237
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,645
YOU'D DO ANYTHING?

238
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,146
YEAH, YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.

239
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,148
I GOT SOMETHING YOU CAN DO.

240
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,149
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

241
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,154
CAN YOU BE MY DANCING PARTNER?

242
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,159
THAT'S NOT PRISON LINGO, IS IT?

243
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,165
I WANT TO QUIT THE GYM.

244
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,667
NOW, CAN YOU HONESTLY TELL ME

245
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,169
THAT YOU'RE 100% SATISFIED WITH YOUR BODY?

246
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,671
YES, MOST OF THE TIME.

247
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,673
SURE, I HAVE MY BAD DAYS

248
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,676
BUT THEN I REMEMBER WHAT A CUTE SMILE I HAVE.

249
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,678
WE WERE VOTED BEST EQUIPPED GYM IN NEW YORK

250
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,679
TWO YEARS RUNNING.

251
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,180
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO GIVE THAT UP?

252
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,182
YES. I HATE IT HERE!

253
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,185
EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE IN HERE IS VERY HEAVY.

254
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,688

255
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,190
YEAH.

256
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,692
REALLY?

257
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,194
OKAY.

258
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,697
YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE YOUR FRIEND WORK OUT ALONE, DO YOU?

259
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,198
WHAT FRIEND?

260
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,700
YOUR FRIEND, ROSS, JUST JOINED.

261
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,714
HIS DANCING PARTNER? YEAH.

262
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,716
THERE'S THIS SUPERINTENDENTS' DANCE--

263
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,217
THE SUPER BALL...

264
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,221
AND HE WANTS TO IMPRESS MARGE

265
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,223
THIS LADY SUPER THAT HE'S GOT A CRUSH ON.

266
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,726
WHY DOESN'T HE JUST PRACTICE WITH A GIRL?

267
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,727
HE'S TOO SHY.

268
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,729
HE DOESN'T THINK HE'S GOOD ENOUGH

269
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,230
TO DANCE WITH GIRLS YET.

270
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,231
YEAH, RIGHT.

271
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,734
HE ALMOST DANCED ME RIGHT DOWN THAT...

272
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,235
GARBAGE CHUTE.

273
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,238
OH, WOULD YOU LET IT GO, ALREADY?

274
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,741
YOU'RE FINE.

275
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,745
HEY.

276
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,246
HEY. SO, DID YOU QUIT?

277
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,748
NO. I ALMOST DID.

278
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,752
COULDN'T LEAVE ROSS THERE WITHOUT A SPOTTER.

279
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,255
WAIT, NOW, SO YOU JOINED THE GYM?

280
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,257

281
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,258
OH...

282
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,760
AND THAT'S FUNNY WHY?

283
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,261
OH, UM...

284
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,765
I WAS JUST, YOU KNOW, PICTURING YOU

285
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,267
WORKING OUT, AND, UM...

286
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,769
OH, THAT'S IT.

287
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,272
WE'RE DOOMED, OKAY?

288
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,774
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE 50 BUCKS A MONTH

289
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,276
OUT OF OUR ACCOUNTS FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

290
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,778
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

291
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,781
YOU COULD ACTUALLY GO TO THE GYM.

292
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,285

293
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,787
OR...

294
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,790
OR WE COULD GO TO THE BANK

295
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,291
CLOSE OUR ACCOUNTS

296
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,794
AND CUT THEM OFF AT THE SOURCE.

297
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,296
YOU'RE A GENIUS.

298
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,300
OH, MAN, BUT THEN WE WON'T BE BANK BUDDIES.

299
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,803
NOW THERE'S TWO REASONS.

300
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,807
HEY. HEY. HEY.

301
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:28,808
HEY. HEY.

302
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,309
OH, YOU GUYS.

303
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,812
REMEMBER THAT CUTE CLIENT I TOLD YOU ABOUT?

304
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,814
I BIT HIM.

305
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,817
WHERE?

306
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,819
ON THE TUSHIE.

307
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,821
AND THAT'S NOT AGAINST YOUR OATH?

308
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,322
NO. I KNOW.

309
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,825
I'M SORRY, BUT THE MOMENT I TOUCH HIM

310
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,827
I JUST WANT TO THROW OUT MY OLD OATH

311
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,829
AND TAKE A NEW DIRTY ONE.

312
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,831
WELL, NEXT TIME YOU'RE MASSAGING HIM

313
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,833
YOU SHOULD TRY TO DISTRACT YOURSELF.

314
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,834
YEAH, YEAH.

315
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,837
LIKE, WHEN I'M DOING SOMETHING EXCITING

316
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,841
AND I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO... EXCITED

317
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,343
I JUST TRY AND THINK OF OTHER THINGS

318
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,845
LIKE, UH, SANDWICHES

319
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,346
AND, UH, BASEBALL

320
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,848
AND, UH...

321
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,350
CHANDLER.

322
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,853
THANK YOU, JOEY.

323
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,354
OH, NO. THANK YOU.

324
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,359

325
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,863
ALL RIGHT, I'M HERE.

326
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,865
LET'S, UH, GET THIS OVER WITH.

327
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,867
OKAY, WELL

328
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,368
JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD.

329
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,370

330
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,373
DON'T WE NEED TO DO SOME KIND OF PREPARATION FIRST?

331
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,376
LIKE, UH, GET REALLY DRUNK?

332
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,377
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

333
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,880
JUST PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND ME.

334
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,381
YEAH. OKAY.

335
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,389
I I I'M SORRY.

336
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,391
NO, IT'S OKAY

337
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,392
BUT, IF I'M MARGE

338
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,895
MY BREASTS ARE COMING OUT MY BACK.

339
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,897
AW, FORGET IT.

340
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,899
I'M NOT GOING TO BE ANY GOOD AT THIS.

341
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,900
MY MOM WAS RIGHT.

342
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:01,901

343
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,402
I'M JUST A BIG POTATO

344
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,904
WITH ARMS AND LEGS AND A HEAD.

345
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,906
COME ON, MAN.

346
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,909
YOU'RE NOT A POTATO.

347
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,911
I'M SURE AS HELL NOT A DANCER.

348
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,412
IT'S NO USE.

349
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,415
MARGE WILL NEVER GO FOR ME.

350
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,416
AW, COME ON, TREEGER.

351
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,918
DON'T SAY THAT.

352
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:19,919
YOU JUST, UH...

353
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,921
YOU JUST NEED MORE PRACTICE.

354
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,922
HERE. COME ON.

355
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,423
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN.

356
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,424

357
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,426
COME ON.

358
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,428
PLUS, IT WAS PROBABLY MOSTLY MY FAULT.

359
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,430
I MEAN, I'M NOT REALLY THAT COMFORTABLE

360
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,932
DANCING WITH A...

361
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,433
WHOO HOO!

362
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,435
HEY!

363
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,436
YEAH!

364
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,439

365
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,441
SO HOW GOES THE DANCING?

366
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,943
GAY YET?

367
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,947
HA, HA, HA.

368
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,949
YOU GUYS OWE ME BIG TIME.

369
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,955
WHAT WAS THAT?

370
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,957
WHAT?

371
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,459
YOU JUST DID A LITTLE DANCE Y THING.

372
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,961
NO, I DIDN'T.

373
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,962
YES, YOU DID.

374
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,463
YOU DID, LIKE, A LITTLE HOP.

375
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:05,965
YOU ARE SO ENJOYING THIS.

376
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,466
NO, I'M NOT.

377
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,968
AND IT WASN'T A HOP.

378
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,970
IT WAS APAS DE BOURREE.

379
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,971
OH!

380
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,973

381
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,475
YOU KNOW THE WORDS!

382
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,977
YOU ARE SO INTO THIS.

383
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,479
ALL RIGHT. MAYBE I'M ENJOYING IT A LITTLE BIT.

384
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,481
I MEAN, I'M GETTING PRETTY GOOD AT IT.

385
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,484
OH, THIS IS SO SWEET.

386
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,987
JOEY-- OUR LITTLE TWINKLE TOES.

387
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,488
HEY, HEY. HOLD ON.

388
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,490
THIS ISN'T SOME KIND OF GIRLIE DANCE.

389
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,492
IT'S, LIKE, A SPORT. IT'S MANLY.

390
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,493
YEAH.

391
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,494
ALL RIGHT, COME HERE.

00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,996
SHOW ME SOME MANLY MOVES.

393
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,997
ALL RIGHT.

394
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:38,998

395
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:39,999
OKAY.

396
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,002
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO LEAD.

397
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,509
HELLO.

398
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,011
HI.

399
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,013
WE'D LIKE TO CLOSE OUR ACCOUNTS.

400
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,514
CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNTS?

401
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,016
IS THERE SOME PROBLEM?

402
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,517
NO, NO.

403
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,519
NO. WE'D JUST LIKE TO CLOSE THEM.

404
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,021
OKAY.

405
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,523
MS. LAMBERT HANDLES ALL OUR CLOSURES.

406
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,025
WOULD YOU COME OVER HERE

407
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,027
PLEASE?

408
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,029
HI. I'M KAREN.

409
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,032
I WANT TO QUIT THE BANK!

410
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,038
OKAY, BASEBALL.

411
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,040
RICK PLAYING BASEBALL.

412
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,042
OKAY, HE SLIDES INTO SECOND.

413
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,544
MAYBE EVEN HIS PANTS COME DOWN A LITTLE.

414
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,046
OH, NO! WAIT! NO!

415
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,047
NO, NO.

416
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,049
ALL RIGHT, SANDWICHES, SANDWICHES.

417
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,051
UM, OKAY, ON A PLATE.

418
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,553
MAYBE RICK'S PANTS COME DOWN A LITTLE.

419
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,555
NO, NO!

420
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,057
CHANDLER.

421
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,059
OKAY, CHANDLER.

422
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,062
OOH, THAT'S WORKING.

423
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:53,072
CHANDLER'S... KNEES.

424
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,574
CHANDLER'S ANKLES.

425
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,076
CHANDLER'S ANKLE HAIR.

426
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,078
OH, NO.

427
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,081
OKAY, YOU'RE ALL SET.

428
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,082
OH, WOW.

429
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,583
THAT WAS AMAZING.

430
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,085
WAS THAT REALLY JUST AN HOUR?

431
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,586
YEAH...

432
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,589
IN REALLY LONG HOUR WORLD.

433
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,091
WHAT?

434
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,094
OKAY.

435
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,596
I HAVE AN ENORMOUS CRUSH ON YOU

436
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,599
BUT, BECAUSE YOU'RE A CLIENT, I CAN'T ASK YOU OUT

437
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,602
EVEN THOUGH YOU GIVE ME, YOU KNOW, THE FEELINGS.

438
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,604
WOW.

439
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,106
I HAD NO IDEA

440
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,108
BUT, UH, HEY

441
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,110
I CAN ALWAYS FIND ANOTHER MASSEUSE.

442
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,112
REALLY?

443
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,114
YEAH, REALLY.

444
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,620
WHAT?

445
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,123
SUDDENLY, I'M VERY AWARE THAT I'M NAKED.

446
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,626
OKAY, QUIET DOWN.

447
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,632
MR. SIMON'S BEEN WAITING FOR... OH, MY GOD.

448
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,134
WHY WASN'T I OFFERED THAT?

449
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,637
I'D DEFINITELY PAY MORE FOR THAT.

450
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,640
PHOEBE, WE HAVE RULES HERE.

451
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,642
THIS IS NOT THAT KIND OF PLACE.

452
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,144
NO, YEAH, OH, AND I KNOW

453
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,645
BUT THIS ISN'T HOW IT LOOKS AT ALL

454
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,648
BECAUSE RICK IS, UM... MY HUSBAND.

455
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,150
OH, REALLY?

456
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,652
WELL, THEN, YOU BETTER TELL HIS OTHER WIFE

457
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,654
BECAUSE SHE CALLED THREE TIMES

458
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,156
ASKING WHERE HE IS.

459
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,161
YES, I WILL TELL... HER.

460
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,664
SO YOU DIDN'T LEAVE THE BANK?

461
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,166
NO...

462
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,667
AND, SOMEHOW, WE ENDED UP

463
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,171
WITH A JOINT CHECKING ACCOUNT.

464
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,673
WHAT ARE YOU EVER GOING TO USE THAT FOR?

465
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,177
TO PAY FOR THE GYM.

466
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,179
HEY. HEY.

467
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,180
HEY!

468
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,681
SO, I HAD A GREAT DAY.

469
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,183
RICK AND I HIT IT OFF.

470
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,684
WE STARTED MAKING OUT

471
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,687
AND THEN MY BOSS WALKED IN AND FIRED ME FOR BEING A WHORE.

472
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,189
WHAT? WHAT?

473
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,190
YOU GOT FIRED?

474
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,192
IT'S SO WEIRD.

475
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,695
I HAVE NEVER BEEN FIRED FROM ANYTHING BEFORE.

476
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,696
SWEETIE.

477
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,698
I JUST STARTED WALKING AROUND

478
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,201
NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO NEXT, YOU KNOW?

479
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,703
I STARTED ASKING PEOPLE ON THE STREET

480
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,205
IF THEY WANTED MASSAGES.

481
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,208
THEN THESE POLICEMEN THOUGHT I WAS A WHORE, TOO.

482
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,709
OH!

483
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,212
IT'S REALLY BEEN A BAD DAY, WHORE WISE.

484
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,215

485
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:19,718
HEY, DUCK.

486
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,221
IS CHICK HERE?

487
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,223
YEAH...

488
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,726
BUNNY RABBIT.

489
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,728
YOU READY FOR OUR LAST PRACTICE?

490
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,729
YEAH, BUT I THINK THE REASON

491
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,731
WE'RE NOT GETTING THAT SPIN RIGHT

492
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,733
IS BECAUSE MY APARTMENT'S TOO SMALL.

493
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,734
WANT TO USE OUR PLACE?

494
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,735
NO.

495
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,237
I HAD ANOTHER IDEA.

496
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,244
?? NIGHT AND DAY ??

497
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,747
?? YOU ARE THE ONE ??

498
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,253
?
?? ONLY YOU BENEATH THE MOON ?

499
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,754
?? OR UNDER THE SUN ??

500
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:02,761
?
?? WHETHER NEAR TO ME OR FAR ?

501
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,764
?? IT'S NO MATTER, DARLING , WHERE YOU ARE ??

502
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,767
?? I THINK OF YOU ??

503
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:14,273
?? NIGHT AND DAY. ??

504
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,280
WE DID IT!

505
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,281
I KNOW! WE DID IT!

506
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,782
HEY, THAT WAS INCREDIBLE, HUH?

507
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,783
THAT WAS AMAZING!

508
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,785
I MEAN, WE TOTALLY NAILED IT!

509
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,786
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

510
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,787
HEY, LISTEN.

511
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,290
THANKS A LOT, TRIBBIANI.

512
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,291
OH, MY GOD.

513
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,792
LOOK AT THE TIME.

514
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,794
I GOT TO CATCH THE BUS TO THE BALL.

515
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,796
OH. OKAY.

516
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,797
GOOD LUCK.

517
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,299
YEAH.

518
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,302
UNLESS YOU WANT TO PRACTICE THE FOX TROT AGAIN

519
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,803
OR THE TANGO?

520
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,805
UH, THANKS, BUT NO.

521
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:51,310
YOU SEE, I THINK I'M READY TO DANCE WITH GIRLS.

522
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,811
OKAY.

523
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,313
GO GET THEM, TREEGER.

524
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,314
RIGHT.

525
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,320
HEY, UH...

526
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,321
YOU WANT TO COME?

527
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,822
MARGE HAS A GIRLFRIEND.

528
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,823
REALLY?

529
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:05,824
YEAH.

530
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,326
YOU COULD DANCE WITH HER.

531
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,827
SHE'S THE SAME SIZE AS ME.

532
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,330
NO. I'M GOOD.

533
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,840
?? NIGHT AND DAY. ??

534
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,348
SO, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOT SOME GREAT EXPERIENCE HERE.

535
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,349
LET'S SEE.

536
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,850
REASON FOR LEAVING LAST JOB?

537
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,352
YEAH. THEY THOUGHT I WAS A WHORE.

538
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,355
OKAY.

539
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,857
WE'LL GIVE YOU A CALL IF ANYTHING COMES UP.

540
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,859
GREAT.

541
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,861
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
