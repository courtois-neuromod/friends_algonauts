1
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,509
 OH, MAN!

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,011
WHAT IS THAT?

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,013
TREEGER'S SNAKING THE SHOWER DRAIN.

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,014
OH.

5
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,016
 WHAT IN THE NAME

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,518
OF HELL...?!

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,520
HEY, MAYBE HE FOUND YOUR FLIP FLOP.

8
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,524
HEY...

9
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,026
WHOA.

10
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,527
IS THIS PORN?

11
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,029
WHAT DID I DO?

12
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,531
I MUST'VE HIT SOMETHING ON THE REMOTE.

13
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,533
DO WE PAY FOR THIS?

14
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,536
NO. WE DIDN'T EVEN PAY OUR CABLE BILL.

15
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,539
MAYBE THIS IS HOW THEY PUNISH US.

16
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,541
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T PAY OUR PHONE BILL.

17
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,543
FREE PHONE SEX.

18
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,545
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T PAY OUR GAS BILL.

19
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:52,552
WHOA, HEY, THAT LADY'S ALL KINDS OF NAKED.

20
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,055
YEAH. JOEY JUST PRESSED SOMETHING ON THE REMOTE

21
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,057
AND IT JUST... CAME ON.

22
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,558
HEY, THAT HAPPENED TO ME ONCE.

23
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,561
I WAS JUST FLIPPING THROUGH THE CHANNELS, AND BAM!

24
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,063
IT WAS LIKE FINDING MONEY.

25
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,066
LIKE FINDING MONEY WITH NAKED PEOPLE ON IT.

26
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,568
THEN I MADE THE MISTAKE OF TURNING OFF THE TV.

27
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,571
I NEVER GOT IT BACK AGAIN.

28
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,073
AND I'M SAD.

29
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,581
WHY WOULD HE TURN OFF THE TV?

30
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:26,586
 TELEVISION

43
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,633

44
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,135
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

45
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,637
COME ON, DO WE REALLY HAVE TO WATCH THIS WHILE WE EAT?

46
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,139
NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!

47
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,142
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD MAKE THIS GO AWAY.

48
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,146
YEAH, SO NO ONE TOUCHES THE REMOTE

49
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,148
AND NO ONE TOUCHES THE TV.

50
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,651
AND NO ONE TOUCHES THE AIR... AROUND THE TV.

51
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,156
IMAGINE A PROTECTIVE PORN BUBBLE, IF YOU WILL.

52
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,657
OKAY?

53
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,160
I'M AT LEAST GOING TO MUTE IT.

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,161
NO NO NO! NO NO NO!

55
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,164

56
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,666
WE STILL HAVE PORN. YEAH.

57
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,171
HI. HEY.

58
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,672
HONEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

59
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,673
THAT'S TOO HEAVY.

60
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,674
COME HERE.

61
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,676
THANKS.

62
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,178
OH, GOD...

63
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,679
OKAY.

64
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,181
OH, HONEY...

65
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,183
I'M GETTING TOO PREGNANT FOR THIS...

66
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,185
LUGGING AROUND A STUPID MASSAGE TABLE.

67
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,687
I HAVE TO FIND A JOB WHERE I CARRY A SMALLER TABLE.

68
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,688
OR A JOB

69
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,690
WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO CARRY A TABLE.

70
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,192
YOU MEAN

71
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,193
LIKE A DOCTOR?

72
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,195
PHEEBS, YOU'RE BLOCKING THE PORN.

73
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,196
LOOK OUT.

74
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,198
OHH.

75
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,699
OH, MY.

76
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,702
OH, THAT REMINDS ME-- I HAVE TO SEE MY OB GYN TODAY.

77
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,209
HI.

78
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,710
HI.

79
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,713
SO, UH, EMILY JUST WENT TO THE AIRPORT.

80
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,215
OH. WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE HER?

81
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,217
HER UNCLE HAD ALREADY PLANNED ON DOING IT

82
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,720
AND, YOU KNOW, WE SAID OUR GOOD BYES THIS MORNING, SO...

83
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,722
YOU MUST FEEL HORRIBLE.

84
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,225
HEY, THE GUYS HAVE FREE PORN.

85
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,229
NO...

86
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,230
HEY, CHEER UP.

87
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,232
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HER AGAIN, RIGHT?

88
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,234
WELL, I... THAT'S THE THING.

89
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,735
I DON'T KNOW.

90
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,238
WHEN I BROUGHT IT UP, SHE SAID "THIS IS SO FANTASTIC.

91
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,240
"WHY DO WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE?

92
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,241
LET'S JUST ENJOY..."

93
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,744
NO, YOU... D DON'T DO THE ACCENT.

94
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,746
IT REALLY BUMS ME OUT.

95
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,748
EMILY SAID I WAS PRETTY GOOD.

96
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,750
WELL, THAT'S SOMEONE YOU SHOULD HANG ON TO.

97
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,753
YOU HAVE TO SEE HER AGAIN.

98
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,255
WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH?

99
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,756
BECAUSE...

100
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,759
YOU COULD GET TO LIVE OUT MY FANTASY.

101
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,262
YOU'VE HAD FANTASIES ABOUT EMILY?

102
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,265
NO. YOU KNOW.

103
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,766
THE FANTASY.

104
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,269
MEET SOMEONE FROM A STRANGE LAND, FALL IN LOVE

105
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,271
AND SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIVES TOGETHER.

106
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,773
IS THAT WHY, IN JUNIOR HIGH, YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE

107
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,276
WHO HUNG OUT WITH THAT UKRAINIAN KID?

108
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,778
YEAH, THAT, BUT...

109
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,281
PLUS HIS MOM USED TO PUT SOUR CREAM ON EVERYTHING.

110
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,282
AH...

111
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,285
DO YOU LOVE HER?

112
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,788
WE SAID IT WAS ONLY GOING TO BE TWO WEEKS, YOU KNOW?

113
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,292
YOU LOVE HER.

114
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,294
WHA WHAT IS LOVE, REALLY?

115
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,295
OH...

116
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,796
I KNEW YOU LOVED HER.

117
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,299
YOU NEED TO GO TO THE AIRPORT AND TELL HER.

118
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,300
YOU'LL PROBABLY CATCH HER

119
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,802
JUST AS SHE'S ABOUT TO GO TO THE GATE.

120
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,804
YOU'RE GOING TO CALL OUT HER NAME, AND YELL

121
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,807
"I LOVE YOU," AND SHE'S GOING TO SAY "I LOVE YOU, TOO"

122
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,310
AND THEN YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE

123
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,811
THE MOST AMAZING KISS.

124
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,814
EVERYONE AT THE GATE WILL APPLAUD.

125
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,817
I AM A GOOD KISSER.

126
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,819
WELL, THEN YOU TWO CAN...

127
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,323
CAN SNEAK INTO THE COCKPIT...

128
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,825
THINGS'LL START TO HEAT UP...

129
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,826

130
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,329
THEN A STEWARDESS COMES IN...

131
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,333
I'VE BEEN WATCHING TOO MUCH PORN.

132
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,836

133
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:37,837

134
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,839
IS THAT THE HEARTBEAT? THAT'S IT.

135
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,342
OH, MY GOD!

136
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,344
OH, WOW, THIS IS SO COOL.

137
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,846
HAVE WE TALKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY

138
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,848
OF MULTIPLE BIRTHS?

139
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,850
WELL, WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE CARE OF THIS ONE

140
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,354
AND SHOULD I GET PREGNANT AGAIN, I'LL HOLD ON TO YOUR CARD, OKAY?

141
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,856
NO.

142
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,359
I'M GETTING THREE SEPARATE HEARTBEATS.

143
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:03,363
THREE? YOU GUYS WERE WORRIED I WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE ONE.

144
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,865
DOCTORS ARE WRONG ALL THE TIME.

145
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,866
WELL...

146
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,371
WELL, SO ARE YOU SURE THAT THERE ARE THREE?

147
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,372
DEFINITELY.

148
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,873
OH, MY GOD.

149
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,875
OH, MY GOD.

150
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,878
OH, MY GOD.

151
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,380
SO... SO IN A FEW MONTHS

152
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,382
I'M GOING TO HAVE THREE FULL GROWN BABIES

153
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,384
JUST WALKING AROUND INSIDE ME?

154
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,888
OH, OH! AND IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE ONE OF THOSE LOG RIDES

155
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,391
WHERE THEY JUST COME SHOOTING OUT.

156
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,892
GIVING BIRTH TO THREE BABIES

157
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,895
IS NOT THAT DIFFERENT THAN GIVING BIRTH TO ONE.

158
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,896
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

159
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,900
HAVE YOU EVER HAD TRIPLETS?

160
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,402
NO. I'M SORRY. I HAVEN'T.

161
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,404
I'M GOING TO USE THIS A LOT.

162
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,410
OH, OH... PHOEBE.

163
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,911
OH! HI.

164
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,912
HI!

165
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,417
SO, HOW'D IT GO AT THE DOCTOR'S?

166
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,418
OH, WELL, OKAY.

167
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,420
HEY, YOU KNOW HOW WHEN YOU'RE

168
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,921
UM, YOU'RE WALKING DOWN THE STREET

169
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,924
AND YOU SEE THREE PEOPLE IN A ROW

170
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,428
AND YOU SAY, "OH, THAT'S NICE"?

171
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,931
YES! OKAY.

172
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,433
YEAH, WELL

173
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,935
GOOD NEWS-- YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THREE BABIES. AH!

174
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:16,936

175
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,938
THREE BABIES?

176
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,440
UH HUH.

177
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,941

178
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,445
OH... I FINALLY GOT MY BAND!

179
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,946
OH, OH...

180
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,448
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BIG FAMILY.

181
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,450
I ALWAYS WANTED A BIG FAMILY!

182
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,451
OH, GOD

183
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,453
I'M SO GLAD YOU GUYS ARE HAPPY.

184
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,955
I WAS SO AFRAID YOU WERE GOING TO BE ALL FREAKED.

185
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,957
WHY WOULD WE BE FREAKED?

186
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,959
NO, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT'S HARDER

187
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,463
TO RAISE THEM, AND THE ADDED EXPENSE AND, UGH!

188
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,466
OH.

189
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,967
RIGHT.

190
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,969
NO. BACK TO HAPPY.

191
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,472
BACK TO HAPPY!

192
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,973
NO, NO, NO, NO...

193
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,976
IT'S GOING TO BE FINE BECAUSE, UM...

194
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,978
BECAUSE I TEACH HOME EC

195
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,481
AND, UH, I CAN HAVE 30 KIDS

196
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,983
MAKING BABY CLOTHES ALL YEAR LONG.

197
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,486
YOU KNOW, IT'LL BE LIKE...

198
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,489
MY VERY OWN LITTLE SWEATSHOP.

199
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,493
I BEEN THINKING, EVER SINCE YOU SAID

200
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,495
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TRIPLETS...

201
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,499
THE BEST THING FOR ME TO DO IS

202
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,000
DROP OUT OF COLLEGE AND GET A JOB.

203
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,001
NO, FRANK.

204
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,004
NO, YOU CAN'T QUIT COLLEGE. NO.

205
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,506
YOU'RE IN COLLEGE, REALLY?

206
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,508
YEAH. REFRIGERATOR COLLEGE.

207
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,509
YEAH.

208
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,511
YEAH, YOU KNOW

209
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,512
WHEN WE FOUND OUT

210
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,514
WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A BABY, YOU KNOW

211
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,517
I FIGURED, YOU KNOW, LIKE, I SHOULD HAVE...

212
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,518
LIKE A CAREER, YOU KNOW

213
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,020
AND I LOVE REFRIGERATORS.

214
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,523
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP ON YOUR DREAM.

215
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,524

216
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,025
NO, IT'S OKAY.

217
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,528
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THREE KIDS

218
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,031
AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF DREAM.

219
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,033
THREE KIDS AND NO MONEY.

220
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,542
This is the boarding call

221
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,543

222
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,044
 EMILY...

223
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,547
OH, MY GOD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

224
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,550
I JUST... I HAD TO SEE YOU ONE MORE TIME

225
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,051
BEFORE YOU TOOK OFF.

226
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,054
YOU ARE SO SWEET.

227
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,059
THAT'S THAT'S A BIG CANDY BAR.

228
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,064
I HAD THE MOST AMAZING TIME WITH YOU.

229
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,067

230
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,569
This is the final boarding call

231
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,571

WELL, THAT'S ME.

233
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,584
HERE, HAVE THIS-- I'M ONLY ALLOWED

234
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,586
ONE PIECE OF CARRY ON ANYWAY.

235
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,588

236
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,090

I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. UM...

239
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,097
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

240
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,600
I'M JUST GOING TO COME OUT AND SAY IT, OKAY?

241
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,102
UH... I... I THINK...

242
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,606

OH.

244
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,618
THANK YOU.

245
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,628
IT'S NO PROBLEM.

246
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,134
?? BOW CHICKA BOW WOW ??

247
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,136
?? BOW CHICKA BOW WOW. ??

248
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,638
WHAT IS THAT SONG?

249
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,640
IT'S BEEN IN MY HEAD ALL DAY.

250
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,142
IT'S THE THEME FROM GOOD WILL HUMPING.

251
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,148
YOU KNOW WHO DOESN'T EVEN LIKE DIRTY MOVIES?

252
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,650
MY NEW BOYFRIEND, JOSHUA.

253
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,152
YEAH, RIGHT.

254
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,153
NO, HE TOLD ME

255
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,155
HE PREFERS TO LEAVE CERTAIN THINGS

256
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,657
TO THE IMAGINATION.

257
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,659
OH, OH, YEAH, AND DID HE ALSO SAY

258
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,161
THAT HE THOUGHT THAT SOME OF THE DIALOGUE WAS CORNY

259
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,164
AND THAT HE ACTUALLY FOUND IT FUNNY, NOT SEXY?

260
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,166
YES!

261
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,168
YEAH, HE LIKES PORN.

262
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,673
WHERE YOU GOING?

263
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,175
I'M GOING TO FIND OUT IF HE REALLY THINKS

264
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,677
SUPER MODELS ARE TOO SKINNY.

265
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,678
HEY. HEY.

266
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,679
HI.

267
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,681
HOW'D IT GO WITH FRANK AND ALICE?

268
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,182
WELL, FRANK HAS TO QUIT COLLEGE

269
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,184
BECAUSE HIS SUPER FERTILE SISTER'S

270
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,686
HAVING THREE BABIES. UGH.

271
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,689
SO I NEED TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY REALLY FAST

272
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,692
AND I HAD AN IDEA THAT I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT

273
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,694
BECAUSE YOU WORK FOR A BIG COMPANY.

274
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,195
OKAY. INSIDER TRADING.

275
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,697
WHAT INFORMATION IS THERE

276
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,199
THAT YOU CAN GIVE ME?

277
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,702
THEY DON'T REALLY TALK TO US ABOUT THAT STUFF.

278
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,204
I COULD GET YOU SOME FREE WITE OUT, THOUGH.

279
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,209
DID YOU DO WHAT I SAID?

280
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,711
DID YOU TELL HER? I DID.

281
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,212
AND...? WHAT'D SHE SAY?

282
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,714
THANK YOU.

283
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,215
YOU'RE TOTALLY WELCOME.

284
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,217
WHAT'D SHE SAY?

285
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,723
SHE SAID, "THANK YOU."

286
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,725
I SAID, "I LOVE YOU"

287
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,727
AND SHE SAID...

288
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,228
"THANK YOU."

289
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,731
WELL, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

290
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,233
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

291
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,235
DID YOU SAY YOU LOVE HER?

292
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,238
YEAH, WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO GET HER TO DO?

293
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,241
WHAT DO I DO NOW?

294
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,244
YOU PLAY HARD TO GET.

295
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,747
SHE ALREADY LIVES IN LONDON.

296
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,249
SO YOU GO TO TOKYO.

297
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,253
ALL RIGHT, LOOK. FORGET IT.

298
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,254
OKAY? FORGET IT.

299
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,256
YOU TOLD HER YOU LOVE HER. IT'S OVER.

300
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,258
IT IS NOT OVER.

301
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,760
YOU'RE OVER.

302
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,262
WHAT?

303
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,266
YOU KNOW.

304
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,269
OKAY.

305
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,772
GOOD ONE.

306
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,776
IT IS NOT OVER BECAUSE SHE'S GOING TO CALL YOU

307
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,779
AND TELL YOU SHE LOVES YOU, AND THE REASON SHE COULDN'T

308
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,281
IS HER FEELINGS WERE SO STRONG IT SCARED HER.

309
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,783
GO HOME AND WAIT FOR HER CALL.

310
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,785
SHE COULD BE CALLING FROM THE PLANE.

311
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,786
COME ON, NOW. GO, GO.

312
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,287
OKAY, OKAY

313
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,290
BUT IF SHE DOESN'T CALL, IT IS DEFINITELY OVER.

314
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,793
NO, WAIT, WAIT-- UNLESS, EVENTUALLY

315
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,796
I CALL HER, YOU KNOW, TO TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON

316
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,298
AND AND SHE SAYS SHE'LL CALL ME BACK

317
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,800
BUT THEN SHE DOESN'T

318
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,803
THEN... IT'S OVER.

319
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,305
WAY TO BE STRONG, MAN.

320
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,315
HI.

321
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,316
HI. HEY.

322
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,819
CAN WE WATCH CARTOONS ON YOUR TELEVISION?

323
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,320
WE NEED A PORN BREAK.

324
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,822
WE SPENT THE LAST TWO HOURS

325
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,325
WATCHING IN AND OUT AND IN AGAIN.

326
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,329
WELL, SO, WHY DON'T YOU JUST TURN IT OFF?

327
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,831
BECAUSE THEN WE'D BE THE GUYS

328
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,332
WHO TURNED OFF FREE PORN.

329
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:58,337
YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT, LIKE, WHAT YOU GO BY.

330
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,340
RACH, LOOK, I'M GOING TO HAVE A KID SOMEDAY, OKAY?

331
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,342
AND, SOMEDAY, THAT KID IS GOING TO ASK ME

332
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,344
IF I EVER TURNED OFF FREE PORN.

333
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,345
I DON'T WANT

334
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,347
TO HAVE TO TELL HIM THAT I DID.

335
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,349
DID YOU EVER ASK YOUR DAD THAT?

336
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,351
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

337
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,856
OH! GOOD. YOU'RE HERE.

338
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,857
HI. HEY, HI.

339
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,358
WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

340
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,359
OH, THIS?

341
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,861
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU ASKED.

342
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,866
NOW, DON'T YOU HATE IT

343
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,868
WHEN YOU HAVE TO CUT A TIN CAN

344
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,370
WITH AN ORDINARY STEAK KNIFE?

345
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,872
HA.

346
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,875
NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

347
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,877
PREGNANT WOMAN SLAYS FOUR?

348
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,378
 PHOEBE, THEY DIDN'T

349
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,881
MAKE YOU PAY FOR THOSE KNIVES, DID THEY?

350
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,882
NO.

351
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,883
ARE YOU SURE?

352
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,384
NO.

353
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,886
HONEY, YOU WON'T MAKE

354
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,888
ENOUGH MONEY TO HELP FRANK AND ALICE

355
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,889
JUST BY SELLING KNIVES.

356
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,390
NO, NO. I KNOW THAT.

357
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,393
I JUST NEED TO MAKE ENOUGH FOR THE SECOND PART OF MY PLAN.

358
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,895
WHAT'S THE SECOND PART?

359
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,896
MY SATURN DEALERSHIP.

360
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,401

361
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,406
HELLO.

362
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,909
ROSS.

363
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,911
EMILY, HI.

364
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,912
UH...

365
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,915
HOW WAS, HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT?

366
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,917
It was dreadful.

367
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,919
I FELT TERRIBLE ABOUT HOW I ACTED

368
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,421
WHEN YOU SAID THOSE WONDERFUL THINGS.

369
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,424
NO, NO. TH THAT'S THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

370
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,927
UM... I'M JUST GLAD YOU CALLED.

371
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,428
Ross, um...

372
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,932
there's something that I I've got to tell you.

373
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,936
UH, THERE'S THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE.

374
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,442
DOES THAT MEAN THE SAME THING IN ENGLAND

375
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,944
AS IT DOES IN AMERICA?

376
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,448
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHICH ONE OF US SHE WANTS--

377
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,451
ME OR THIS COLIN GUY.

378
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,953
SO I TOLD HER, WHEN SHE FIGURES IT OUT

379
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:54,954
GIVE ME A CALL.

380
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,455
MAYBE I'LL STILL BE AROUND.

381
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,958
OKAY, JUST SO I KNOW, WHEN YOU SAY "STILL AROUND"

382
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,459
DO YOU MEAN STILL AROUND

383
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,461
LIKE YOU MIGHT BE IN A RELATIONSHIP

384
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,463
OR STILL AROUND LIKE YOU MIGHT HAVE DIED

385
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,465
WAITING FOR THE PHONE TO RING?

386
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,967
OH, IT WAS SO RIGHT.

387
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,969
THIS ISN'T HOW IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO.

388
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,470
THERE CAN'T BE ANOTHER GUY.

389
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,472
WELL.

390
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,976
OF COURSE THERE'S ANOTHER GUY!

391
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,478
THIS IS EVEN MORE PERFECT.

392
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,481
NOW YOU HAVE TO PROVE YOUR LOVE.

393
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,483
I'M NOT PROVING ANYTHING, OKAY?

394
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,985
I'M DONE LISTENING TO YOU.

395
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,987
IF I HADN'T LET YOU TALK ME INTO GOING

396
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,488
TO THE AIRPORT IN THE FIRST PLACE

397
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,491
I NEVER WOULD HAVE PUT MY FIST THROUGH THE WALL.

398
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,993
YOU PUT YOUR FIST THROUGH THE WALL?

399
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,496
NO, I MISSED AND HIT THE DOOR...

400
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,999
BUT IT OPENED REALLY HARD.

401
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,501
YOU HAVE TO GO TO LONDON.

402
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,003
WHAT?

403
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,504
YEAH, YOU HAVE TO GO FIGHT FOR HER.

404
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,006
OH, YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE.

405
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,008
YOU ALREADY TOLD HER YOU LOVED HER

406
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,509
AND SHE DIDN'T SAY IT BACK.

407
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,012
THEN SHE CALLED AND TOLD YOU THERE WAS ANOTHER GUY

408
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,514
SO, YEAH, GO TO LONDON; THAT'LL SCARE HER.

409
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,519
WHEN RACHEL WAS WITH PAOLO, WHAT DID YOU DO?

410
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,022
I MADE FUN OF HIS ACCENT.

411
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,024
YOU SAT BACK AND LET HIM HAVE HER.

412
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,526
YOU DIDN'T FIGHT AT ALL; AM I RIGHT?

413
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,527
I JUST TOLD YOU

414
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,030
I MADE FUN OF  HIM BEHIND HIS BACK.

415
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,531
OH, I SEE.

416
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,532
YOU WANT THE SAME THING

417
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,534
TO HAPPEN WITH EMILY?

418
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,536
NO. ALL RIGHT, THEN.

419
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,538
GO FIGHT FOR HER. WHOA!

420
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,541
OH, MAN.

421
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,044
IT'S LIKE A SNAKE PIT.

422
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,046
THAT COULD BE YOU AND EMILY.

423
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,551
THAT, BUT BUT NICER.

424
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,054
JUST GO TO LONDON.

425
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,056
REALLY?

426
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,557
COME ON, SURPRISE HER.

427
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,558
SHOW UP AT HER DOORSTEP.

428
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,560
DON'T LET HER GO WITHOUT A FIGHT.

429
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,062
ALL RIGHT.

430
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,064
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO DO IT.

431
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,566
I'M GOING TO... I'M GOING TO GO TO LONDON

432
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,568
AND I AM GOING TO FIGHT FOR HER.

433
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,570
OKAY. GOOD LUCK.

434
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,072
ROSS. ROSS!

435
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,573
IF YOU'RE GOING TO THE AIRPORT

436
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,077
CAN YOU PICK ME UP ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE TOBLERONE BARS?

437
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,585
OH, OH! I DID IT. I DID IT.

438
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,587
I FIGURED OUT A WAY TO MAKE MONEY.

439
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,090
I'M GOING TO OPEN UP MY OWN MASSAGE PLACE

440
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,591
AND FRANK'S GOING TO HELP ME.

441
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,593
AND WE CAN WORK IT  AROUND HIS SCHEDULE

442
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,595
SO HE DOESN'T HAVE TO QUIT SCHOOL.

443
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,097
?? LA LA LA LA! ??

444
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,599
THAT SOUNDS GREAT, BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO AFFORD IT?

445
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,601
WE WERE WALKING DOWN THE STREET

446
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,603
AND SAW THAT VAN YOU USED FOR CATERING

447
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,105
AND WE REALIZED THAT...

448
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,106
I'M TELLING IT!

449
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,607
OKAY.

450
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,610
OKAY, YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE NEED TRANSPORTATION

451
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,112
BUT THEY ALSO NEED MASSAGES TO RELAX.

452
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,614
SO I JUST FIGURED WE CAN COMBINE THE TWO.

453
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,117
OKAY? I GIVE THE MASSAGES AND FRANK DRIVES.

454
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,618
I CAN FIX UP THE VAN

455
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,121
BOLT A TABLE IN BACK, AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE GOT?

456
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,124
A PLACE THAT NO ONE WILL EVER GET OUT OF ALIVE?

457
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,625
WELL, NO.

458
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,127
THINK ABOUT IT.

459
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,630
IT'S A TAXI THAT PEOPLE TAKE WHEN THEY NEED TORELAX.

460
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,632
IT'S A RELAXI TAXI.

461
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,137
THE NAME IS MY FAVORITE PART!

462
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,639
WELL WELL, I CAME UP WITH IT.

463
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,640
YOU DID NOT!

464
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,642
OH! WHAT?!

465
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,144
NO!

466
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,646
YOU CAME UP WITH "RELAXI CAB."

467
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,148
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

468
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,149
WELL...

469
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,150

470
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,652
HELLO.

471
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,653
OH, MY GOD.

472
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,155
ROSS, ARE YOU IN ENGLAND?

473
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,656
WAS EMILY SURPRISED?

474
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,658
NO, BECAUSE SHE HASN'T COME HOME YET.

475
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,660
SHE HASN'T BEEN HOME ALL NIGHT.

476
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,662
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY STAYING WITH THAT OTHER GUY

477
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,164
AND I'M THE STUPID MORON

478
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,667
WHO SPENT THE WHOLE NIGHT OUTSIDE HER PLACE.

479
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,169
WHAT WAS THAT?

480
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,671
I JUST PUT MY FIST THROUGH ANOTHER WALL.

481
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,173
TELL THE GUY.

482
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,676
ALL RIGHT, WHEN IS THE NEXT FLIGHT OUT?

483
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,677
ABOUT FOUR HOURS.

484
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,179
Stay a couple more hours

485
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,681
and if she doesn't show up by then, just come home.

486
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:43,682
OH, I JUST REMEMBERED.

487
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,184
THERE'S A GIRL AT THE RESTAURANT

488
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,185
THAT WOULD BE PERFECT FOR YOU.

489
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,688
HEY, TELL HIM ABOUT RELAXI TAXI

490
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,192
AND ASK HIM IF HE THINKS THAT'S BETTER THAN RELAXI CAB.

491
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,694
OKAY, IT'S NOT RELAXI CAB.

492
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,697
IT'S RELAXI CAB-- LIKE TAXICAB.

493
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,199
OH, THAT IS BETTER.

494
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,206
 DO YOU HAVE ANY EIGHTS?

495
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,707
NOPE.

496
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,711

497
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,220
ARE WE IN LONDON?

498
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,222
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

499
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,223
YOU CAN'T BE HERE.

500
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,725
I'VE, UH... I'VE COME TO TALK TO ROSS.

501
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,726

502
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,728

503
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,730
WHAT?

504
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,235
NOTHING. NO, NOTHING.

505
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,237
UM, I WAS GOING TO CALL HIM, BUT...

506
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,239
HA! YOU CAME TO TELL HIM YOU LOVE HIM.

507
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,240
I KNEW IT!

508
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,241
I WAS RIGHT!

509
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,742
I'M RIGHT, RIGHT?

510
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,245
I'D REALLY RATHER TALK TO HIM.

511
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,249
I, UH... I'VE BEEN TO HIS APARTMENT

512
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,752
AND HE'S NOT THERE AND, UH, I NEED TO TALK TO HIM, SO...

513
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,754
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE HE IS?

514
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,761

515
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,765
 Ross, are you there?

516
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,769
Ross...

517
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,771
I don't know if you can hear this

518
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,773
but I'm going to talk anyway.

519
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,275
I'M IN THE STATES

520
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,277
WITH YOUR SISTER AND YOUR FRIENDS

521
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,779
AND... IT'S ALL OVER WITH COLIN.

522
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,282
I came here to tell you that and to tell you--

523
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,783
What?

524
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,786
Yes, Joey, you can have all the chocolate you want.

525
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,787
Just take it.

526
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,789
UM...

527
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,293
I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU...

528
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,795
THAT I LOVE YOU.

529
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,797
I LOVE YOU, TOO!

530
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,300
I'M I'M GOING TO CALL YOU RIGHT NOW

531
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,801
FROM THE PHONE BOOTH.

532
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,303
YOU CAN'T HEAR ME...

533
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,307
I WISH I COULD KNOW IF YOU'D HEARD THAT.

534
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,309
I'VE EITHER TOLD YOU I LOVE YOU

535
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,311
OR GIVEN MY NEIGHBORS A GOOD LAUGH.

536
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,313
MRS. NEWMAN, IF YOU'RE LISTENING, BUGGER OFF.

537
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,315
THIS IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

538
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,319
I SUPPOSE THERE'S NOT MUCH CHANCE

539
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,820
YOU DID HEAR THAT AND...

540
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,323
THERE'S THE CALL WAITING, SO...

541
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,824
I SHOULD GO.

542
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,327
OH, WELL.

543
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,331
HELLO.

544
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,832
 Hi.

545
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,338
ROSS, I LOVE YOU.

546
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,839
 OH...

547
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,343
THANK YOU.

548
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,853
HEY.

549
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,355
HEY.

550
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,856
I WAS JUST AT THE BANK

551
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,359
AND THERE WAS THIS REALLY HOT TELLER

552
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,363
AND SHE DIDN'T ASK ME TO GO DO IT WITH HER IN THE VAULT.

553
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,365
SAME KIND OF THING HAPPENED TO ME.

554
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,867
WOMAN PIZZA DELIVERY GUY COMES OVER

555
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,870
GIVES ME THE PIZZA, TAKES THE MONEY AND LEAVES.

556
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,872
WHAT? NO, LIKE, "NICE APARTMENT.

557
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,374
BET THE BEDROOMS ARE HUGE"?

558
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,376
NO. NOTHING.

559
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,378
YOU KNOW WHAT?

560
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,380
WE HAVE TO TURN OFF THE PORN.

561
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,382
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
