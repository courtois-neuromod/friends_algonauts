1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,507
THAT'S, LIKE, THE TENTH TIME I'VE PEED

2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,009
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,012
IT'S ALSO, LIKE, THE TENTH TIME YOU'VE TOLD US.

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,013
YEAH, OH, I'M SORRY.

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,514
IT MUST BE REALLY HARD TO HEAR.

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,517
I TELL YOU, IT'S A LOT EASIER HAVING THREE BABIES PLAYING

7
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,519
BRINGIN' IN DA' NOISE, BRINGIN' IN DA' FUNK

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,521
ON YOUR BLADDER.

9
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,024
OH, I AM SO TIRED OF BEING PREGNANT.

10
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:29,029
I CAN'T SLEEP EXCEPT ON MY BACK, WHICH HURTS, SO I CAN'T SLEEP.

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,533
THE ONLY HAPPINESS I GET IS FROM A CUP OF COFFEE

12
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,536
WHICH, OF COURSE, IS DECAF BECAUSE, OH, I'M PREGNANT.

13
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:40,040
PHEEBS, YOU... YOU WANT A COOKIE?

14
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:45,045
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

15
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,547
SO, UH, PHEEBS, HONEY

16
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,549
HOW ARE THOSE MOOD SWINGS COMING?

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,552
I HAVEN'T REALLY HAD ANY YET.

30
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,103
HEY, GUYS.

31
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,604
HEY. HEY.

32
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,106
ALL RIGHT. HERE'S THE RING.

33
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:50,110
YES, YES. A THOUSAND TIMES, YES.

34
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,612
SO, UH, ANY IDEAS FOR THE BACHELOR PARTY YET?

35
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,114
 WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

36
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,116
BEFORE YOU START HANDING OUT WEDDING RINGS

37
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,617
AND PLANNING BACHELOR PARTIES

38
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,120
DON'T YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHO YOUR BEST MAN'S GOING TO BE?

39
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,121
OH, IT'S AWKWARD.

40
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,622
IT'S AWKWARD, IT'S AWKWARD.

41
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,626
I SORT OF ALREADY ASKED CHANDLER.

42
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,627
WHAT?!

43
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,130
HE GOT TO DO IT AT YOUR FIRST WEDDING.

44
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,631
JOEY, I FIGURED YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

45
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,633
I MEAN, I'VE KNOWN HIM A LOT LONGER.

46
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,635
COME ON, ROSS. I DON'T HAVE ANY BROTHERS.

47
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,637
I'M NEVER GOING TO GET TO BE A BEST MAN.

48
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,639
YOU CAN BE THE BEST MAN

49
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,640
WHEN I GET MARRIED.

50
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,643
I'M NEVER GOING TO GET TO BE A BEST MAN!

51
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,644
WAIT, WAIT.

52
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,146
SO YOU GET TO BE

53
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,147
MY BEST MAN TWICE

54
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,150
AND I DON'T GET TO BE YOURS AT ALL?

55
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,151
OH, NO.

56
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,654
YOU... OF COURSE YOU CAN BE MY BEST MAN.

57
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,159
WHAT ABOUT ME?

58
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,660
YOU JUST SAID I COULD.

59
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,662
I'M NOT EVEN GETTING MARRIED, OKAY?

60
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,665
THIS IS A QUESTION FOR SCIENCE FICTION WRITERS.

61
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,168
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE NOT PICKING ME.

62
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,169
HEY, HOW COULD IT NOT BE ME?

63
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,170
I'M NOT EVEN...

64
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,171
I DON'T EVEN...

65
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,672
ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT?

66
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,174
THAT'S IT.

67
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,176
FROM NOW ON, JOEY, I WANT YOU TO BE MY BEST MAN.

68
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,177
YES!

69
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,180
SHAME ABOUT YOU, THOUGH.

70
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,185
STOP IT.

71
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,686
WHAT?

72
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,688
ONE OF THE BABIES IS KICKING.

73
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,190
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD THING.

74
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,192
IT'S NOT KICKING ME.

75
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,194
IT'S KICKING ONE OF THE OTHER BABIES.

76
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:18,698
OH, DON'T MAKE ME COME IN THERE.

77
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,699
HEY. HEY.

78
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,202
DO YOU GUYS HAVE, LIKE, A BIG BOWL I CAN BORROW?

79
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,204
YEAH. THERE'S ONE RIGHT UNDER THE CABINET.

80
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,205
THANKS.

81
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,706
WHY DO YOU NEED IT?

82
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,208
OH, WE'RE HAVING A BIG PARTY TOMORROW NIGHT. LATER.

83
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,709
 WHOA, HEY.

84
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,711
WERE YOU PLANNING ON INVITING US?

85
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,213
NO, NO.

86
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,214
LATER.

87
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,217
HEY, GET YOUR ASS BACK HERE, TRIBBIANI!

88
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,721
HORMONES.

89
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,722
WHAT PHOEBE MEANT TO SAY

90
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,224
WAS HOW COME YOU'RE

91
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,726
HAVING A PARTY A ND WE'RE NOT INVITED?

92
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,229
OH. IT'S ROSS'S BACHELOR PARTY.

93
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:49,729
SO?

94
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,231
ARE YOU BACHELORS?

95
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,233
NO.

96
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,235
ARE YOU STRIPPERS?

97
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,237
NO.

98
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,239
THEN YOU'RE NOT INVITED.

99
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,240
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

100
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,741
YOU'RE NOT INVITED TO THE PARTY

101
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,742
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE EITHER.

102
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,745
OH, WELL, WHAT PARTY?

103
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,248
WELL, UM...

104
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,250
THE BABY SHOWER FOR PHOEBE.

105
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,252
BABY SHOWER?

106
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,255
WOW... THAT SO DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SOMETHING I WANT TO DO.

107
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,256
LATER.

108
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,258
I CAN'T BELIEVE

109
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,261
I'M GOING TO HAVE A PARTY.

110
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,762
THAT'S SO GREAT!

111
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,265
A PARTY! YAY!

112
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,766
MY GOD!

113
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,268

114
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,772
OH, HONEY...

115
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,774
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

116
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,777
THIS IS WHAT I GOT GOING FOR THE PARTY SO FAR LIQUOR WISE:

117
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,279
"GET A LOT OF LIQUOR."

118
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,780
GREAT, GREAT.

119
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,782
OKAY. NOW, IN TERMS OF THE INVITE LIST

120
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,784
OBVIOUSLY, I GOT YOU, ME AND CHANDLER

121
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,286
AND I'M GOING TO INVITE GUNTHER

122
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,788
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS PRETTY LOUDLY.

123
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,789
I'LL BE THERE.

124
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,291
ALL RIGHT, AND...

125
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,792
OH, LISTEN-- I KNOW IT'S YOUR PARTY

126
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,794
BUT I'D REALLY LIKE TO LIMIT THE NUMBER

127
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,297
OF MUSEUM GEEKS THAT ARE GOING TO BE THERE.

128
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,298
YEAH, TELL YOU WHAT.

129
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,301
LET'S NOT INVITE ANY OF THE ANTHROPOLOGISTS, OKAY?

130
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,303
JUST THE DINOSAUR DUDES.

131
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,808
OKAY. WE'LL NEED A SIX PACK OF ZIMA.

132
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,811
HEY, GUYS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

133
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,313
OH, JUST PLANNING

134
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,815
MY BACHELOR PARTY WITH MY BEST MAN.

135
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,818
YEAH, WELL, GOOD LUCK TRYING TO TOP THE LAST ONE.

136
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,819
YEAH, SEE, I DON'T THINK

137
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,321
IT'S GOING TO BE THAT DIFFICULT

138
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,323
CONSIDERING THIS ONE WON'T TAKE PLACE

139
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,824
IN THE BASEMENT OF A PIZZA HUT.

140
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,326
OH, I'M ROSS, I'M ROSS.

141
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,827
I'M TOO GOOD FOR THE HUT.

142
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,829
I'M TOO GOOD FOR THE HUT.

143
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,331
LOOK. I GOT TO GO PICK UP BEN.

144
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,333
EVERYTHING SO FAR SOUNDS GREAT, JOEY.

145
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,834
JUST REMEMBER TO KEEP IT

146
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,336
ON THE MELLOW SIDE, OKAY?

147
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,338
JUST A COUPLE OF GUYS HANGING OUT PLAYING POKER.

148
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,340
NO NO STRIPPERS OR ANYTHING, OKAY?

149
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,341
YOU GOT IT.

150
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,342
OKAY. SEE YOU LATER.

151
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,843
SEE YA.

152
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,845
HAVE FUN PLANNING

153
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,347
YOUR MELLOW BACHELOR PARTY.

154
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,349
THERE'S GOING TO BE STRIPPERS THERE.

155
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,851
HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT NO STRIPPERS.

156
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,856
HE JUST SAID, "NO STRIPPERS."

157
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,358
OH. I CHOSE NOT TO HEAR THAT.

158
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,361
LOOK WHAT I GOT!

159
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,862
LOOK WHAT I GOT!

160
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,364
LOOK WHAT I GOT!

161
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,367
OH...

162
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,368
CAN YOU BELIEVE

163
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,370
THEY MAKE THESE FOR LITTLE PEOPLE?

164
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,872
AW, LITTLE VILLAGE PEOPLE.

165
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,378
OKAY. LOOK AT THIS ONE.

166
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,380
THIS IS MY FAVORITE.

167
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,381
OH, THAT IS SO SWEET.

168
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,882
I KNOW.

169
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,884
PHOEBE'S GOING TO LOVE DRESSING THEM IN THESE.

170
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,387
HUH. EXCEPT, UH...

171
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,391
PHOEBE'S NOT GOING TO BE THE ONE WHO GETS TO DRESS THEM.

172
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,895
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT GOING TO GET TO KEEP THE BABIES.

173
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,397
OH, MY GOD.

174
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,400
WE ARE THROWING THE MOST DEPRESSING BABY SHOWER EVER.

175
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,901
NO... WAIT A MINUTE.

176
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,902
UNLESS WE GIVE HER

177
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,404
ALL GIFTS THAT SHE CAN USE

178
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,406
AFTER SHE'S DONE BEING PREGNANT--

179
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,907
LIKE REGULAR COFFEE

180
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,908
TEQUILA.

181
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,410
A CARTON OF CIGARETTES.

182
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,411
SHE DOESN'T SMOKE.

183
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,912
IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS.

184
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,914
OH, NO, IT'S A GREAT IDEA. IT'S A GREAT...

185
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,418
OH, AND SOMEBODY CAN GET HER THOSE, THOSE LEATHER PANTS THAT SHE'S ALWAYS WANTED.

186
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,919
OH, SHE'S GOING TO LOVE THAT.

187
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,921
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

188
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,423
YOU ACTUALLY THOUGHT

189
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,925
IT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL BETTER

190
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,926
TO GIVE ME SOMETHING

191
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,429
I CAN'T EVEN USE FOR ANOTHER TWO MONTHS?!

192
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,431
THIS SUCKS! OOH!

193
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,434
WHO GAVE ME THIS?

194
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,436
WELL, UM... I... I...

00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,444
THE BEST PRESENT I EVER GOT! OH!

213
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,477
A LITTLE ANNOUNCEMENT.

214
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,481
I'VE DECIDED THAT MY BEST MAN IS MY BEST FRIEND, GUNTHER.

215
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,985

00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,523
YOU GOT SOME CHILI ON YOUR NECK.

00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,067
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW THEY LET YOU KEEP CHICKENS AND DUCKS AS PETS.

252
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,069
AND I GOT THE DUCK TOTALLY TRAINED, TOO.

253
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,070
WATCH THIS.

254
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,073
STARE AT THE WALL.

255
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,076
HARDLY MOVE.

256
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,079
BE WHITE.

257
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,080
YOU ARE

258
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,082
REALLY GOOD AT THAT.

259
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,084
SO, I HAD FUN TONIGHT.

260
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,587

00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,588
WELL, THANKS, THANKS.

00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,092
AND LISTEN, IF ANY OF MY FRIENDS EVER GET MARRIED

264
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,595

00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,597
YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT.

266
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,600
SO, I GUESS, UM, GOOD NIGHT.

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,101
OH, UNLESS YOU, UH...

268
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,604
UNLESS YOU WANT TO HANG AROUND.

269
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,605
YEAH?

270
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,106
YEAH. I'LL LET YOU PLAY

271
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,107
WITH MY DUCK.

272
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,609

273
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,121
HEY...

274
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,626
STRIPPER?

275
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,638
THE STRIPPER STOLE THE RING!

276
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,640
THE STRIPPER STOLE THE RING!

277
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,141
CHANDLER, GET UP! GET UP!

278
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,143
THE STRIPPER STOLE THE RING!

279
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,144
WHAT?

280
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,646
THE RING IS GONE!

281
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,647
OH.

282
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,148
OKAY. JUST, LIKE, GIVE ME...

283
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,651
A MINUTE TO WAKE UP FOR THIS.

284
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,152

285
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,655
YOU LOST THE RING.

286
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,156
YOU'RE THE WORST BEST MAN EVER.

287
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,658
DUDE, THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

288
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,159
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

289
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,161
I GO TO SLEEP LAST NIGHT, EVERYTHING'S COOL.

290
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,663
I WAKE UP THIS MORNING

291
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,165
THE STRIPPER'S GONE AND THE RING IS GONE.

292
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,167
YOU SLEPT WITH THE STRIPPER?!

293
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,669
OF COURSE.

294
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,171
HI, GUYS.

295
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,172
HI, PHOEBE.

296
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,173
HI, PHOEBE.

297
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,675
I I WANTED

298
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,177
TO APOLOGIZE IF I, YOU KNOW

299
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,680
SEEMED A TAD EDGY YESTERDAY AT MY SHOWER

300
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,682
YOU KNOW.

301
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,683
IT'S JUST THE HORMONES, YOU KNOW.

302
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:24,684
NO. WE...

303
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,686
HORMONES. HORMONES, YEAH.

304
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,688
ANYWAY, I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU.

305
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,689
IT WAS SO SWEET.

306
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,190
OKAY.

307
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,692
YOU'RE SO SWEET.

308
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,193
THANKS.

309
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,695
YEAH.

310
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,197
WOW, YOU SEEM TO BE DOING SO MUCH BETTER. THAT'S GREAT.

311
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,198
HOW ARE THINGS GOING?

312
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,700
GOOD.

313
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,702
OKAY. IT FEELS LIKE IT'S...

314
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,203
EVERYTHING'S BEEN ABOUT ME LATELY.

315
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,205
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH YOU?

316
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,207
OH. WELL, ACTUALLY, WE WERE JUST TALKING

317
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,710
ABOUT ME NOT GOING TO ROSS' WEDDING.

318
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,211
OH.

319
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,713
IT JUST MIGHT BE TOO HARD

320
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,715
GIVEN THE HISTORY AND ALL THAT.

321
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,717
WOW, THIS REMINDS ME OF THE TIME

322
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,719
WHEN I WAS, UM, LIVING ON THE STREET

323
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,721
AND THIS GUY OFFERED TO BUY ME FOOD

324
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,723
IF I SLEPT WITH HIM.

325
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,227
BUT... H HOW IS THIS LIKE THAT?

326
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,729
WELL, LET'S SEE...

327
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,231
IT'S NOT REALLY... LIKE THAT

328
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,734
BECAUSE, YOU SEE, THAT WAS AN ACTUAL PROBLEM

329
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,236
AND, UM, YOURS IS JUST LIKE, YOU KNOW

330
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,238
A BUNCH OF, YOU KNOW, HIGH SCHOOL CRAP

331
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,741
THAT NOBODY REALLY GIVES... YOU KNOW.

332
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,747
WELL, I'M, I'M SORRY.

333
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,248
I GUESS I JUST THOUGHT...

334
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,750
ALL RIGHT, HERE COME THE WATERWORKS.

335
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,251

336
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,754
OH! I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

337
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,255
I CALLED THE COMPANY THAT SENT HER

338
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,757
AND THEY DON'T CARE.

339
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,759
THEN I CALLED 911, AND THEY YELLED AT ME.

340
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,261
IF THIS ISN'T AN EMERGENCY, THEN WHAT IS?

341
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,263
I'LL TELL YOU, JOE, I REALLY WANT TO HELP YOU OUT

342
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,765
BUT I GOT PLANS TO GO SEE TITANIC

343
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,768
SO I'VE GOT TO CALL 911 TO FIND OUT WHAT TIME IT STARTS.

344
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,771
HEY, GUYS.

345
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,273
HEY. HEY.

346
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,776
I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR LAST NIGHT.

347
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,777
WHAT A GREAT PARTY.

348
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,278
AND THE GUYS FROM WORK HAD A BLAST.

349
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,282
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THEM HAD NEVER BEEN TO A BACHELOR PARTY BEFORE.

350
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,786
YEAH, AND ANOTHER ONE HAD NEVER BEEN TO A PARTY BEFORE.

351
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,790
SO, UH, HEY, THAT, THAT WEDDING RING

352
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,291
HUH?

353
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,293
MAN, THAT IS NICE.

354
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,294
YEAH, RIGHT?

355
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,796
I WAS, UH, I WAS THINKING

356
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,298
I MIGHT PICK ONE OF THOSE BABIES UP FOR MYSELF.

357
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,300
WHERE MIGHT ONE GET ONE OF THOSE?

358
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,802
THAT RING?

359
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,304
WHEN MY GRANDMOTHER FIRST CAME TO THIS COUNTRY

360
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,807
THAT RING AND THE CLOTHES ON HER BACK

361
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,809
WERE ALL SHE HAD WITH HER.

362
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,815
SO YOU MIGHT SAY THAT THE RING IS IRREPLACEABLE.

363
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,316
MMM!

364
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,317
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

365
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,820
IT'S BEEN IN MY FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS

366
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,822
AND EVERY BRIDE WHO'S WORN IT

367
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,824
HAS LIVED A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE.

368
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,827
SO YOU MIGHT SAY IT'S A MAGIC RING.

369
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,333
THE STRIPPER STOLE IT.

370
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,836
HUH?

371
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,838
WHAT?

372
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,340
WHAT WHAT DID YOU JUST...?

373
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,843
I THINK I HEARD WHAT HE SAID.

374
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,344
I BELIEVE IT WAS...

375
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,347
OH, YES: "THE STRIPPER STOLE THE RING."

376
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,349
MY... MY RING?

377
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,851
MY MY WEDDING RING?

WELL, I THINK IT ALL STARTED WHEN YOU SAID

381
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,862
"HEY, JOEY, WHY DON'T YOU BE MY BEST MAN?"

382
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,365
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, FINE.

383
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,367

00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,869
DUDE, I I SCREWED UP.

385
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,370

387
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,873
ON THE STRIPPER.

388
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,374
OH, YEAH, WELL, I ALREADY DID THAT.

389
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,876
THEY SAID THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO IT

390
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,878
RIGHT AFTER THEY SOLVE ALL THE MURDERS.

391
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,879

392
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,881

I DID THAT, TOO. THEY WOULDN'T

394
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,384
GIVE ME HER REAL NAME OR HER NUMBER.

395
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,886
THEY SAID IF I BOTHERED THEM AGAIN

396
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,887
THEY'D CALL THE POLICE.

397
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,888
I SAID, "YOU TALK TO THE POLICE

398
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,389
YOU TELL THEM I'M MISSING A RING."

399
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,892

00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,896

402
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,397

403
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,398

00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,960
I'M GOING TO BOIL SOME WATER AND JUST RIP UP SOME SHEETS.

425
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,461
OH. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

426
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,463
IT'S PROBABLY FALSE LABOR.

427
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,465

I KNOW.

488
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,609
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, USUALLY

489
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,611
WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH THE PREGNANT THING

490
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,613
THEN, YOU KNOW, YOU GET TO DO THE MOM THING.

491
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,118
I'M GOING TO BE, YOU KNOW, SITTING AROUND

492
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,121
IN MY LEATHER PANTS DRINKING TEQUILA.

493
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,125
SOME MOMS DO THAT.

494
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,127

00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,629

IT'S LIKE I KNOW THEM, YOU KNOW, AND AND...

499
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,143
IT'S JUST NOT... IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY

500
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,146
WHEN, YOU KNOW, THESE LITTLE BABIES HAVE TO GO AWAY.

501
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,148
OH, I KNOW, SWEETIE, BUT IT'S NOT LIKE

502
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,150
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANYTHING.

503
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,153
I MEAN, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE NIECES AND NEPHEWS.

504
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,155

509
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,665
OR YELLING AT THEM WHEN THEY'RE BAD, YOU KNOW

510
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,667
OR DECIDING TO PUT THEM ON RITALIN

511
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,669
WHEN THEY JUST WON'T CALM DOWN.

512
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,671
YOU KNOW?

513
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,174
I MEAN, YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE ONE THAT THEY COME TO

514
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,175

515
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,676
