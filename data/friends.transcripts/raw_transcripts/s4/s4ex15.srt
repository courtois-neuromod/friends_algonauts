1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,504
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GETTING MY NAILS DONE

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,006
AND YOU SAID IT WAS GOING

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,007
TO BE FUN...

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,508
WHICH IT KIND OF IS.

5
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,510
ALSO, YOU SAID THERE WERE GOING

6
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,012
TO BE OTHER GUYS HERE.

7
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,014
THERE ARE NO OTHER GUYS HERE.

8
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,016
CHANDLER, THERE'S A GUY RIGHT OVER THERE.

9
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,518
THAT'S A MAILMAN.

10
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,021
THAT'S OUR MAILMAN.

11
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,023
: HI. HOW ARE YOU?

12
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,029
CHANDLER, DON'T WORRY.

13
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,032
THIS DOESN'T MAKE YOU ANY LESS OF A GUY.

14
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,533
THAT DOES.

15
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,537
WHAT AM I SITTING ON?

16
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,541
I'D HATE TO THINK WHAT THIS WOMAN WAS SCRATCHING

17
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,043
WHEN THIS BROKE OFF.

18
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,545
HEY, YOU KNOW WHO USED TO HAVE NAILS LIKE THAT?

19
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,546
NO. Janice: OH...

20
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,549
MY... GOD!

34
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:41,234
JOEY, LET ME ASK A QUESTION.

35
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,102
THIS HAS BEEN

36
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,103
DRIVING ME CRAZY.

37
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,105
WHAT DOES THIS LIGHT SWITCH DO?

38
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,106
OH, NOTHING.

39
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,607
DIDN'T IT DRIVE YOU CRAZY

40
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,109
NOT TO KNOW WHAT IT DID?

41
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,611
I KNOW WHAT IT DID-- NOTHING.

42
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:55,115
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE PUT IT THERE IF IT DIDN'T DO SOMETHING.

43
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,616
HOW CAN YOU NOT CARE?

44
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,118
LIKE THIS.

45
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,123
HERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION FOR YOU:

46
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,625
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT LITTLE SILVER KNOB

47
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,626
ON THE TOILET DOES?

48
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,128
SURE. IT FLUSHES IT.

49
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,629
OKAY, GOOD.

50
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,132
SINCE YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU COME OVER

51
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,135
WOULD YOU MIND ACTUALLY USING IT?

52
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,636
HELLO. HEY.

53
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,637

54
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,638

55
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,640
 OH, MY GOD. WOW.

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,642
GUESS WHO WE RAN INTO TODAY.

57
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,645
JANICE.

58
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,646
IS THIS AMAZING?

59
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,648
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

60
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,650
WELL, UM... I'M DIVORCED.

61
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,651

62
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,652
WOW.

63
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,654
YEAH, I'M RIDING THE ALIMONY PONY.

64
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,157

65
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,659
AND THERE IT IS.

66
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,662
I JUST CAME  UP TO SAY HI.

67
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,663
HI.

68
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,165

69
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,666
AND YOU, SWEETIE, I'LL SEE LATER.

70
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,667
OKAY.

71
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,668
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

72
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:49,669
OKAY. BYE. BYE.

73
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,171
BYE. BYE. BYE. OH, BYE.

74
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,172
BYE BYE. BYE BYE.

75
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,173
BYE. BYE. OH.

76
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,674
I CAN'T STAND THE WOMAN.

77
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,677
WHAT?

78
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,679
I THOUGHT YOU WE RE CRAZY ABOUT HER.

79
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,682
I KNOW, BUT YOU KNOW ALL THOSE LITTLE ANNOYING THINGS

80
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,184
THAT SHE DID BEFORE WE FELL IN LOVE--

81
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,686
LIKE HER VOICE AND HER LAUGH AND HER PERSONALITY?

82
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:07,687
THEY'RE ALL BACK

83
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,189
YOU KNOW.

84
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,192
AND SHE'S PICKED UP, LIKE, NINE NEW ONES.

85
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,694
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING BRINGING HER HERE?

86
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,695
THERE'S PEOPLE HERE.

87
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,197
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

88
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,199
I'M TAKING CARE OF IT TONIGHT.

89
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,700
YOU ARE NOT.

90
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,203
YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO BREAK UP WITH HER.

91
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,205
I DON'T HAVE TO BREAK UP WITH HER THIS TIME.

92
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,706
WE'RE NOT INVOLVED.

93
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,708
I'M GOING TO DO A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE.

94
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,211
I'M GOING TO END IT WITH HER BEFORE IT STARTS.

95
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,712
MY ASS IS, LIKE, FROZEN.

96
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,218
YEAH? TRY STICKING  IT IN THE FREEZER FOR 20 MINUTES.

97
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,223
I'M TELLING YOU.

98
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,233
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU REALLY WALK ALONE HERE AT NIGHT.

99
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,735
I MEAN, YOU HEAR SUCH STORIES ABOUT NEW YORK.

100
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,737
NO, IT'S REALLY NOT THAT BAD.

101
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,739
I MEAN, I I FOR ONE FEEL PERFECTLY SAFE.

102
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,740
 EM! EM!

103
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,742

104
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,743
HELP! HELP!

105
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,744
HELP!

106
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,246
COME HERE, LUV.

107
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,247
NO NO NO, ROSS.

108
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,749
ROSS, THESE ARE FRIENDS OF MINE FROM HOME.

109
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,750
LIAM, DEVON...

110
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:11,751
THIS IS ROSS.

111
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:12,752
OH. HI, MATE.

112
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,254
HEY. HOW ARE YOU, MATE?

113
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,255
HA!

114
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,257
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE, HUH?

115
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,259
"HELP! HELP!"

116
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,760
 SO, HOW ARE YOU?

117
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,263
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO RING YOU EVER SINCE I ARRIVED

118
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,265
BUT, UM, WELL, I'VE BEEN RATHER BUSY.

119
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,267
DO YOU REALIZE WE HAVE NOT SEEN

120
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,769
EACH OTHER SINCE THE NIGHT OF THAT U 2 CONCERT?

121
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,272
HUH. OH, MY GOD, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

122
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,773
WELL, ACTUALLY, THE LAST TIME

123
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,776
YOU AND I SAW EACH OTHER  WAS THE NEXT MORNING.

124
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,278
OH, LIAM.

125
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,280
HA! OH, LIAM.

126
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,784
SO, UH, WHAT, WERE YOU GUYS PLAYING SOCCER OR SOME...?

127
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,788
OR OR SHOULD I CALL IT FOOTBALL?

128
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,290
WE WERE PLAYING RUGBY.

129
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,292
WE'RE PLAYING A GAME AT THE PARK TOMORROW.

130
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,794
YOU'RE WELCOME TO PLAY, TOO, IF YOU WANT.

131
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,795
ROSS PLAY RUGBY?

132
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,297
I DON'T THINK SO.

133
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,798

134
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,801
WHAT... WHAT'S SO FUNNY ABOUT THAT?

135
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,802
WELL, I MEAN...

136
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,304
YOU'RE AMERICAN, TO START WITH.

137
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,306
YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE RUGBY HERE.

138
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,309
WELL, WE DIDN'T HAVE FREEDOM HERE

139
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,312
UNTIL 1776 EITHER, SO...

140
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,813
SO, GOOD, THEN. WE'LL SEE YOU

141
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,315
AT RIVERSIDE PARK AT 2:00.

142
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,816
CHEERS. CHEERS. CHEERS.

143
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,319

144
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,321

145
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:29,329
OH, BOY, I JUST LOVE TO SING.

146
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,331
YES, I I KNOW THAT YOU DO.

147
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,334
I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS PEOPLE WERE COMPLAINING

148
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,336
WAS BECAUSE MOST OF THE PEOPLE HAD PAID

149
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,338
TO HEAR THE ACTOR SING "OLD MAN RIVER."

150
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,339
OH, LOOK AT US.

151
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,840
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT

152
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,343
THAT CUPID HAD A STATION AT 14th STREET NAILS?

153
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,845

154
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,348
OKAY, WE HAVE TO TALK.

155
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:53,353
I'M JUST GETTING OUT OF A VERY SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP.

156
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,354
I KNOW...

157
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,357
AND I'M JUST GETTING OUT OF A MARRIAGE.

158
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,359
I MEAN, TALK ABOUT "MEANT TO BE."

159
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,361
RIGHT...

160
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,863
BUT I JUST THINK THIS IS HAPPENING TOO SOON.

161
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,865
OH, TOO SO ON, TOO SCHMOON.

162
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,867
FACE IT, HONEY--

163
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,870
I AM NOT LETTING YOU GET AWAY THIS TIME.

164
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,872
I HEAR YOU...

165
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,873

166
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,877
BUT...

167
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,880
UNFORTUNATELY, MY COMPANY...

168
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,383
IS TRANSFERRING ME OVERSEAS.

169
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,387
OH, NO.

170
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,389
WHERE TO?

171
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,890
TO PARIS?

172
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,891
NO.

173
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,393
NO, NOT NOT PARIS.

174
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,394
OH, TO LONDON?

175
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,396
OH, NO. ROME? VIENNA?

176
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,897
OH, OOH, BARCELONA?

177
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,400
OKAY, COULD YOU JUST STOP TALKING FOR A SECOND?

178
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,903
YEMEN.

179
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,904

180
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,907
THAT'S RIGHT, YES.

181
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,410
I'M BEING TRANSFERRED TO YEMEN.

182
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,911
WHEN?

183
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,413
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY...

184
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,414
OH.

185
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,917
WELL, I WILL JUST HAVE TO SOAK UP

186
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:03,923
EVERY OUNCE OF CHANDLER BING UNTIL THAT MOMENT COMES.

187
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,927
BUT I DO KNOW IT'S SOMETIME TOMORROW.

188
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,932
DONE?

189
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,933
YEP.

190
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,934
HEY.

191
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,935
HEY. HEY.

192
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,437
WHAT'S UP?

193
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,439
THIS SWITCH THING HAS BEEN DRIVING ME CRAZY.

194
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,941
SO I TURNED IT OFF AND CHECKED EVERY OUTLET.

195
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,943
FOUR DON'T WORK, WHICH MEANS ONE OF THEM

196
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,945
HAS TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE SWITCH.

197
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,947
SO, I PLUGGED IN THINGS

198
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,949
IN ALL FOUR OUTLETS THAT MAKE NOISE.

199
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,451
THAT WAY, WHEN I TURN IT ON

200
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,453
I JUST FOLLOW THE NOISE AND FIND OUT

201
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,954
WHICH ONE IT IS.

202
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,457
I BET I STOPPED LISTENING BEFORE YOU DID.

203
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,461
YOU KNOW, YOU YOU ALSO COULD HAVE USED, UH, LAMPS

204
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,463
AND THEN FOLLOWED THE LIGHT.

205
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,965
YEAH, WELL, I'M USING NOISE.

206
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:46,966
ALL RIGHT.

00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:47,967
OKAY.

00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,476
OH, MY GOD, I HEAR SOMETHING.

212
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,477
I HEAR SOMETHING.

213
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,978
WHERE IS IT?

214
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,982

215
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,484

216
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,491
IT'S COMING FROM JOEY.

217
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,992

218
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,994
OH, MY GOD, THAT'S SO FREAKY.

219
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,496
TURN HIM OFF!

220
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,501
 Goes back to England with the set scrum

221
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,002
in center field.

222
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,003
OOH, HEY.

223
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,004

00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,006
CAN WE PUT ON THE NEWS?

225
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,508
I THINK IT MIGHT BE RAINING.

226
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,510
NO. JUST HOLD ON A SECOND.

227
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,012
I'M WATCHING THIS RUGBY THING ON ESPN.

228
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,014
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.

229
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,516
I'M MAN ENOUGH  TO PLAY THIS SPORT.

230
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,518
DUDE, YOU'RE NOT EVEN MAN ENOUGH

231
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,520
TO ORDER THE CHANNEL THAT CARRIES THIS SPORT.

232
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,523
HEY, THERE, ROSS.

233
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,025
HEY.

00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,026
JANICE.

235
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,030
YOU KNOW, UH...

236
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,033
YOU REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO HELP ME PACK.

237
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,036
WHEN YOU SAID ALL YOU WERE GOING TO BE DOING BETWEEN NOW

238
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,538
AND THE TIME YOU LEAVE IS PACKING

239
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,040
YOU REALLY DIDN'T LEAVE ME MUCH CHOICE, DID YOU?

240
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,043
WELL, I THOUGHT I DID, BUT I I GUESS I DID NOT.

241
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,045
HEY.

242
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,547

243
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,548
OH, I'M PACKING.

244
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,049
YOU KNOW, I I'M PACKING

245
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,051
BECAUSE I'M MOVING TO YEMEN TOMORROW.

246
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,554
WELL, THANKS FOR TELLING ME.

247
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,058
I'M ONLY PRETEND MOVING TO YEMEN, OKAY?

248
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,060
IT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN GET RID OF HER.

249
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,061
OH...

250
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,563

HEY, CHANDLER, COME ON.

254
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,572

255
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,073
AND STUFF IT IN YOUR SHOES.

256
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,575
IT'S A REAL SPACE SAVER.

257
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,576
YEAH, I KNOW.

258
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,578

269
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,594
HEY, I CAN HANDLE IT.

270
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,095

271
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:00,099

00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,112
AND IS A HUM KIND OF LIKE A SCRUDDLE?

278
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,113

WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS ANYWAY?

282
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,622
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE GUY

283
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,123

00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,626
I MEAN, HE'S, LIKE... JOE RUGBY.

285
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,128
YOU'RE KIDDING... AND HE PLAYS RUGBY?

286
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,129
THAT'S SO FUNNY.

287
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,631

288
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,632

292
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,139
PLAYING RUGBY WITH HIM WAS, LIKE, HILARIOUS.

293
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,142
SO, I'M GOING TO SHOW HER HOW TOUGH I REALLY AM.

294
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,644

295
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,146
I'M SORRY. YOU'RE RIGHT.

296
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,648
YOU ARE A TOUGH GUY.

297
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,150
YOU ARE THE TOUGHEST PALEONTOLOGIST I KNOW.

298
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,652
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

299
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,654
LOOK, ROSS COULD TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF.

300
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,656

I'LL JUST LOOK REAL ENERGETIC

304
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,663
AND STAY AWAY FROM THE BALL.

305
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,665
OH, LOOK, I'LL BE THAT GUY

306
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,166
RIGHT OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE.

307
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,668
Ojomo to Back to Bracken.

308
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,669
OH!

00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,170

00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,174
THERE WAS A DOG LOOKING AT HIM.

312
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,186
ROSS, ROSS, YOU WANT TO STAY AWAY

313
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,688

314
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,189

315
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,691
DUDE, THEY'RE ALL HUGE.

316
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,193
THEY DON'T LOOK ANY BIGGER THAN ME.

317
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,194
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S

318
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,696
BECAUSE YOU'RE CLOSER TO YOU

319
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,198
SO YOU LOOK BIGGER TO YOU FROM WHERE YOU ARE.

320
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,200
I'M JUST GOING TO GO

321
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,703
AND SAY "HELLO" TO THE LADS, ALL RIGHT?

322
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,704

00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,213

327
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,215
 OKAY, OKAY

328
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,717
I KNOW WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO.

329
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,719
I'VE GOT TO GO "RED ROSS"

330
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,222
YOU KNOW, "RED ROSS"?

331
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,725
TOTALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

332
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,728
COME ON, THE TIME THAT  WE WERE ALL WAITING IN LINE

333
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,729

00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,740
NO.

339
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,741
YOU'LL SEE.

340
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,744
LIAM, DO ME A FAVOR.

00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:25,745
YEAH?

342
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,747
TELL THE LADS TO GO EASY ON ROSS.

343
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,248
IT'S HIS FIRST TIME.

344
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,250
YOU DON'T SAY.

345
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,757
THANKS.

346
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,758

359
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,783

360
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,284
HELP! HELP!

363
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,296
OH! YOU... ARE...  NOT GOING TO BELIEVE IT.

364
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,798
JOSHUA CAME INTO WORK TODAY.

365
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,299
AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENED.

366
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,301
HE ASKED YOU OUT?

367
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,303
NO. BUT I WAS SHOWING HIM SOME CUFF LINKS

368
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,305
AND I FELT HIS PULSE.

369
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,808
SAUCY.

370
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,811
WHAT ARE THESE?

371
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,814
AH! ELECTRICAL PLANS FOR THE BUILDING.

372
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,815
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

373
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,817
SHOULD I BE SCARED?

374
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,818
I KNOW THAT SWITCH

375
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,319
HAS GOT TO DO SOMETHING, OKAY?

376
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,821
SO SO I WENT DOWN TO CITY HALL

377
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,822
AND I GOT THESE.

378
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,323
ALL I HAD TO DO IS PAY $25 DOLLAR

379
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,825
AND WAIT IN LINE

380
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,826
FOR THREE HOURS.

381
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,328
WOW! IF ONLY MORE PEOPLE KNEW.

382
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,333
ALL RIGHT, DO YOU...

383
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,335
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ANY OF THIS?

384
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,337
NO, NO. I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY

385
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,839
OF THIS ELECTRICAL STUFF.

386
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,341
ALL RIGHT, DOES THIS LOOK LIKE A SWITCH?

387
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,843
I DON'T KNOW.

388
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,344
HMM. IS THIS WIRING?

389
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,345
I DON'T KNOW.

390
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,347
THAT LOOKS LIKE A BUNNY, THOUGH.

391
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,359
YOU KNOW, YOU...

392
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,362
REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE ME TO THE AIRPORT.

393
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,364
OH, PLEASE. EVERY MOMENT IS PRECIOUS.

394
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,366
BESIDES, SOMEBODY HAD TO RIDE

395
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,367
IN THAT OTHER TAXI

396
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,369
WITH THE REST OF YOUR LUGGAGE

397
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,872
AND YOUR FRIENDS DON'T SEEM TO CARE VERY MUCH

398
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,873
THAT YOU'RE LEAVING.

399
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,375
WELL, WE'RE NOT REALLY THAT CLOSE.

400
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,879
OKAY, SO, I GUESS THIS IS, UH...

401
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,380
YOU KNOW, GOOD BYE, THEN.

402
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,882
OH, NO!

403
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,383
NO, IT'S NOT GOOD BYE.

404
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,385
I'M NOT LEAVING UNTIL

405
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,386
YOU GET ON THAT PLANE.

406
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,890
OKAY, WELL, I GUESS JUST WAIT HERE, THEN.

407
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,395
HI. I NEED A FAKE TICKET TO YEMEN.

408
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,396
ONE TICKET TO YEMEN?

409
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,397
OH, NO, NO.

410
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,899
NO, NO, NO, NO.

411
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,902
I JUST NEED... I JUST NEED A PRETEND TICKET.

412
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,903
I I'M SORRY, SIR.

413
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,904
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

414
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:05,905
WHAT WOULD YOU GIVE A KID

415
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,907
IF HE WANTED A TICKET TO PLAY WITH?

416
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,909
ARE YOU TRAVELING

417
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,410
WITH A CHILD?

418
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,912
NO.

419
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,914
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

420
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,915
SHE'S GOING TO THINK

421
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,917
THAT I'M HANDING YOU A CREDIT CARD

422
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,919
BUT WHAT I'M REALLY GOING TO DO

423
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,921
IS HAND YOU A LIBRARY CARD.

424
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,424
UH... SIR, A TICKET TO YEMEN IS $2,100 DOLLAR

425
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,927
AND WE DON'T TAKE LIBRARY CARDS.

426
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,929
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

427
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,930
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

428
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,931

429
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,432
DO YOU HAVE TO STAY?

430
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,935
AMERICAN EXPRESS?

431
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,941
ROSS!

432
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,945
 OH!

433
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:46,946
I CAN'T BELIEVE

434
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,447
THEY'RE DOING THAT TO HIM.

435
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,949
I TOLD THEM TO GO EASY ON HIM.

436
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,951
WELL, NO OFFENSE, BUT, YOU KNOW

437
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,953
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND YOU

438
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,454
YOU KNOW, WITH THE ACCENT, SO...

439
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:56,956

440
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,457
THAT'S JUST HALFTIME.

441
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,458
THERE'S MORE OF THIS.

442
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,459
 OH, HEY.

443
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,961
 HEY.

444
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,462
DID YOU SEE ME?

445
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,964
I WAS PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

446
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,466
THAT IS ONE FUN GAME.

447
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,467
RIGHT. HEY, DO ME A FAVOR.

448
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:09,969
COULD YOU JUST GRAB ME

449
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,971
A BOTTLE OF WATER? THANKS.

450
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,472

451
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,473
I I THINK I'M DYING.

452
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,474
I I REALLY DO.

453
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,976
OH, YOU POOR BABY...

454
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,978
TELL MY SON THAT I LOVE HIM.

455
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,479
OKAY.

456
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,981
OH, EXCELLENT.

457
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,983
OH, OKAY, GOT TO HAVE SOME MORE FUN.

458
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,484
ROSS, THEY ARE KILLING YOU OUT THERE.

459
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,486
MM MMM.

460
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,487
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

461
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,489
SHE'S RIGHT. YOU HAVE TO STOP.

462
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,491
WHAT? NO. NO, I'M NOT STOPPING.

463
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,993
I'M "RED ROSS."

464
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,494
DUDE, YOU GO BACK OUT THERE

465
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,996
YOU'RE GOING TO BE DEAD ROSS.

466
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,998
I DON'T CARE. I AM NOT QUITTING.

467
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,499
I AM GOING TO FINISH THIS GAME.

468
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,001
IF YOU INSIST ON DOING THIS

469
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,502
AT LEAST LET ME HELP YOU.

470
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,005
NO. GOD, NO. THAT  IS NO PLACE FOR A WOMAN.

471
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,007
THOSE GUYS WILL GRAB ANYTHING.

472
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,009
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS SAYING.

473
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,510
I JUST MIGHT KNOW A FEW THINGS

474
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,013
THAT COULD HELP YOU INFLICT SOME PAIN.

475
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,514
I LIKE THAT. YEAH?

476
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,517
LISTEN CLOSELY: DEVON HAS GOT A WEAK ANKLE.

477
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,518
HUH?

478
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,021
ONE SWIFT KICK, AND HE'LL BACK OFF.

479
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,022
BAD ANKLE. GOT IT!

480
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,024
AND THAT BIG BLOKE WITH THE BEARD...

481
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,025
UH HUH?

482
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,026
HE'S GOT A TRICK HIP.

483
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,027
HUH HA!

484
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,528
YEAH. AND DAVID OVER THERE

485
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,031
I'VE HEARD THAT HE DOESN'T WEAR A CUP.

486
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,032
WELL, I COULD USE THAT.

487
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,534
TRICK HIP, NO CUP. OKAY, OKAY!

488
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,536
AND AND LIAM-- LIAM'S GOT BAD KNEES.

489
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:18,537
YOU HIT HIM RIGHT

490
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,539
AND HE'LL GO DOWN LIKE A LAMP.

491
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,041
BUT BUT LIAM'S ON MY TEAM.

492
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,043
I DON'T CARE. YOU JUST GET THEM!

493
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,544
I'M GOING TO GET HIM!

494
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,547
OKAY, I AM GOING BACK IN.

495
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,548

496
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,552
HEY, "RED ROSS," YEAH.

497
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,556
HI.

498
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,557
HI.

499
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,563
WHAT'RE WHAT'RE, WHAT ARE THESE?

500
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,067
OH, JUST SOME PICTURES I MADE AND HUNG UP.

501
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,069
THOUGHT THEY'D BRIGHTEN UP THE PLACE.

502
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,570
THEY DO, DON'T YOU THINK?

503
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,573

504
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,575
NO, NO, DON'T! DON'T!

505
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,576

506
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,577

507
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,081
I KNOW THERE'S NO HOLE THERE.

508
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,083
I JUST REALLY LIKE THAT PICTURE.

509
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,586
OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT THIS!

510
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,088
OKAY, BUT THERE IS

511
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,089
A WIRE BACK THERE.

512
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,591
THAT SWITCH IS CONNECTED TO SOMETHING.

513
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,594
I DON'T CARE. THE WIRES HAVE COME LOOSE IN YOUR HEAD.

514
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,595
I I JUST THOUGHT

515
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,097
IF I COULD FOLLOW THE WIRE

516
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,099
I COULD FIND OUT WHAT IT DID.

517
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,100
AND DID YOU?

518
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,102
NO.

519
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,604
DISAPPEARS BACK THERE BEHIND THAT BASEBOARD.

520
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,106
FOR A MINUTE THERE

521
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,107
I THOUGHT IT WENT DOWNSTAIRS.

522
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,109

523
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,112
SAY HELLO TO MRS. KATRAKAS.

524
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,613
HELLO, DARLING.

525
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,615
HELLO, MRS. KATRAKAS.

526
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,618
HEY, MRS. KATRAKAS, DO YOU KNOW KENNY?

527
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,620
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KID...

528
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,122

529
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,627
NOW, ARE YOU SURE

530
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,130
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO SEE A DOCTOR?

531
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,632
AW, NO. THAT'LL JUST BRING ME DOWN.

532
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,134
THIS WAS GREAT.

533
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,136
I MEAN, I I I WAS GREAT.

534
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,137
THIS WAS A GREAT DAY.

535
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,138
YOU KNOW WHAT?

536
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,639
I'M BUYING EVERYONE COFFEE.

537
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,641
WOULD SOMEONE JUST GRAB MY WALLET?

538
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,642
IT'S IN MY POCKET.

539
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,144
YEAH, SURE. NO, NOT YOU.

540
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,645
OKAY. LOOK, YOUR EYE'S

541
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,647
STILL POPPING  OUT A LITTLE THERE.

542
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,149
I'M GOING TO GO GET SOME ICE.

543
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,150
OOH, ICE, YEAH.

544
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,651
I'M SO IN THE MOOD FOR ICE.

545
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:13,652
YEAH.

546
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,154
AAH...

547
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,655
YOU WERE AMAZING OUT THERE.

548
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,656
OH...

549
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,658
I KIND OF WAS, WASN'T I?

550
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,659
OH, MY GOD!

551
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,663
I MADE A MAN TWICE MY SIZE CRY.

552
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,166
I MEAN, I HAVEN'T DONE THAT SINCE I WAS FOUR

553
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,169
AND I WASHED MY DAD'S PORSCHE WITH ROCKS.

554
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,173
YOU REALLY ENJOYED YOURSELF, DIDN'T YOU?

555
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,174
PLEASE, ARE YOU KIDDING?

556
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,675
I I HURT THREE HUGE MEN.

557
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,677
I GAVE A GUY A BLOODY NOSE.

558
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:42,181
I MEAN, I'M I'M NOT PROUD OF IT, BUT...

559
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,682
I REALLY AM.I MEAN...

560
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,683

561
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,186
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.

562
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,189
YEAH. WONDERFUL, AMAZING YOU.

563
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,191
I THINK YOU'VE GOT A CONCUSSION.

564
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,692
NO. NO, I'M SERIOUS.

565
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,693
THANK YOU.

566
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,696
YOU'RE WELCOME.

567
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,198

568
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,700
I'M SORRY. DID THAT HURT YOU?

569
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,202
IT'S WORTH THE PAIN.

570
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,703

571
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,704
YOU KNOW WHAT?

572
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,206
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S NOT.

573
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,207
SORRY.

574
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,215
 This is the final boarding call for flight 664 to Yemen.

575
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,720

DO YOU EVEN KNOW

579
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,229
HOW LONG YOU'RE GOING TO BE GONE?

580
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,730
WELL, JUST UNTIL

581
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:36,735
WE FIND AN ENERGY SOURCE TO REPLACE FUEL.

582
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,738
OH. WELL, I'LL WRITE YOU EVERY DAY.

583
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,739
OKAY.

584
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,243

585
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,247

586
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,248

587
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,762
CHANDLER?

588
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,763
NOPE.

589
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,265
CHANDLER!

590
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,267
JANICE, THERE YOU ARE. THERE YOU ARE.

591
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,768
I HAD TO HAVE ONE LAST KISS

592
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,770
AND ALSO, YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE

593
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,772
RIGHT AFTER I  GOT ON THE PLANE.

594
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:17,776
NO, NO. I I WANT TO SEE YOU TAKE OFF.

595
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,279
WELL, THEN I GUESS I'M GOING TO YEMEN.

597
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,286
WHEN WE GET TO YEMEN

598
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,288
CAN I STAY WITH YOU?

599
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:39,264
ALL RIGHT. THE SUPER COULDN'T FIGURE OUT

600
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:40,766
WHAT IT DID.

601
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:44,269
A $200 DOLLAR AN HOUR ELECTRICIAN COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT IT DID.

602
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,772
I'VE HAD SEVEN PRETTY SERIOUS SHOCKS.

603
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,774
I OFFICIALLY GIVE UP.

604
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,809
THANK GOD.

605
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,312
GUESS JOEY WAS RIGHT.

606
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,315
IT DOES NOTHING.

607
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,321
SEE?

608
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,826
I'M DOING  IT.

609
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,329
I AM TOTALLY DOING IT.

610
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,837
I LOST IT.
