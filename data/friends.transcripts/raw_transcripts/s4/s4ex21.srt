1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,005
IT SEEMS LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,006
SO MUCH IS HAPPENING.

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,009
I KNOW. ROSS IS GETTING MARRIED...

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,012
PHOEBE'S... MAKING PEOPLE.

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,513
EVERYBODY'S DOING STUFF.

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,015
AND WE JUST SIT HERE.

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,016
IF I DIED, THE ONLY WAY

8
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,018
PEOPLE WOULD EVEN KNOW THAT I WAS HERE

9
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,520
WOULD BE BY THE ASS PRINT ON THIS CHAIR.

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,023
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

11
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,026
WASTING... OUR LIVES.

12
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,028
I MEANT FOR LUNCH.

13
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:32,032
LOOK, WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING, OKAY?

14
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,033
SOMETHING HUGE.

15
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,034

16
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,036
WE COULD CLIMB MT. EVEREST.

17
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,539
NO. NOT SOMETHING STUPID-- SOMETHING HUGE.

18
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,541
NO, NO, I SAW AN AD FOR THIS VIDEO.

19
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,543
PEOPLE CLIMB THAT THING EVERY DAY.

20
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,045
WE COULD TOTALLY DO THAT.

21
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,548
WHY NOT? I MEAN, IT'S JUST... IT'S JUST CLIMBING.

22
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,550
IT'S JUST... IT'S JUST STEEP.

23
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,052
YEAH.

24
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,553
WE'RE GOING TO EVEREST, OKAY?

25
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,056
IT'D BE NICE TO LEAVE AN ASS PRINT ON EVEREST.

26
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,057
HEY. HEY.

27
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,058
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

28
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,560
WE'RE GOING TO CLIMB MT. EVEREST.

29
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,561
YEAH, BABY!

30
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,562
REALLY?

31
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,564
I LOOKED INTO THAT.

32
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,567
YEAH, BUT I MEAN, IT COSTS, LIKE, $60,000 DOLLAR

33
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,069
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD DIE

34
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,572
AND... YOU WOULD DIE.

35
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,074
OH... WELL.

36
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,577
WE COULD GET THAT EVEREST VIDEO THOUGH.

37
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,079
YEAH, WE COULD DO THAT

38
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,581
WITHOUT, YOU KNOW, RISKING OUR LIVES AT ALL.

39
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,583
AND WHILE WE'RE DOWN AT THE VIDEO STORE

40
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,085
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WE COULD RENT?

41
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,586
DIE HARD.

42
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,088
OH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

43
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,090
I JUST REMEMBERED THAT EVEREST THING

44
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,092
IS ONLY AVAILABLE THROUGH MAIL ORDER.

45
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,593
OH, WELL.

46
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,596
SO YOU GUYS WILL STAY HERE AND HANG OUT WITH ME?

47
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,099
YEAH. YEAH.

48
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,600
BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

49
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,603
ONE OF THESE DAYS, WE'RE GOING TO GET OFF OUR BUTTS

50
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,105
AND RENT DIE HARD AGAIN.

51
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,107
YEAH, WE ARE!

64
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,157
WOW.

65
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,158
THAT WAS FAST.

66
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,659
IT USUALLY TAKES ME TWO HOURS

67
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,661
TO GET BEN TO GO DOWN FOR HIS NAP.

68
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,662
HE'S SUCH A LITTLE SWEETHEART.

69
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,164
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE JUST SAID?

70
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,665
WHAT? GOOD NIGHT, MOMMY.

71
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,169
OH... YEAH. THAT'S CAUSE HE'S GOT LOTS OF MOMMIES.

72
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,670
YEAH, IN FACT

73
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,672
IT'S KIND OF BECOME HIS WORD FOR WOMAN.

74
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,174
AH.

75
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,675
SO WHAT DID WE DECIDE?

76
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,678
DOES YOUR UNCLE NATHAN GET AN INVITE OR NOT?

77
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,181
OH, GOD, NOBODY LIKES HIM.

78
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,682
AND HE'S SO CHEAP.

79
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,685
I MEAN, HE'D NEVER FLY TO LONDON IN A MILLION YEARS.

80
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,187
YEAH, INVITE HIM.

81
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,190
HEY, DID I DO THESE NEAT ENOUGH?

82
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,691
YEAH. THEY'RE FINE.

83
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,193
YEAH?

84
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,194
IF ANYONE ASKS

85
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,696
WE'LL SAY THAT BEN ADDRESSED THEM.

86
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:17,697

87
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,200
OH. SO YOU INVITED RACHEL, THEN?

88
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,202
T? SURE. WHY NO

89
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,203
REALLY?

90
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,704
YEAH.

91
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,706
WELL, DON'T THINK I'D BE COMFORTABLE

92
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,708
HAVING ANY OF MY OLD LOVERS THERE.

93
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,210
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

94
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,212
DO YOU THINK MAYBE  WE SHOULDN'T INVITE HER?

95
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,713
OH, NO, NO, ROSS.

96
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,215
YOU KNOW I ABSOLUTELY ADORE RACHEL.

97
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,716
IT'S JUST THAT...

98
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,219
WELL, I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A BIT AWKWARD FOR YOU.

99
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,721
BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY YOUR DECISION.

100
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,723
MORE TEA?

101
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,225
YEAH. SURE.

102
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,226
EARL GREY?

103
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,727
HUH? FINE.

104
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,729
INVITE WHOEVER YOU WANT.

105
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,236
I DON'T WANT TO BE SINGLE, OKAY?

106
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,238
I JUST, I JUST , I JUST WANT

107
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,739
TO BE MARRIED AGAIN.

108
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:08,248
AND I JUST WANT A MILLION DOLLARS!

109
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,249
RACHEL?

110
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,251
OH, GOD, MONICA, HI.

111
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,752
THANK GOD.

112
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,754
 OKAY, EVERYBODY...

00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,257
THIS IS RACHEL , ANOTHER LINCOLN HIGH SURVIVOR.

114
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,758
THIS IS EVERYBODY.

115
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,759

HEY. HI. OH!

OH, GOD!

121
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,270
YOU KNOW, YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW THIS

122
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,772
BUT BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL, I HAD A, UM...

123
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,274
MAJOR CRUSH ON YOU.

124
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,775
I KNEW.

125
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,776
YOU DID? OH.

126
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,777

127
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,779
I ALWAYS FIGURED YOU JUST THOUGHT

128
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,781
I WAS MONICA'S GEEKY OLDER BROTHER.

129
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,283
I DID.

130
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,784
OH!

131
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,287
LISTEN, DO YOU THINK--

132
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,789
AND TRY NOT TO LET MY INTENSE VULNERABILITY

133
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,791
BECOME ANY KIND OF A FACTOR HERE--

134
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,793
BUT DO YOU THINK

135
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,796
IT WOULD BE OKAY IF I ASKED YOU OUT SOMETIME, MAYBE?

136
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,299
YEAH.

137
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,301
MAYBE.

138
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,303
OKAY.

139
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,306
OKAY, MAYBE I WILL.

AH...

147
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,829
IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.

148
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,833
YEAH, I'VE A QUESTION.

149
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,837

00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:51,851
UM, WELL, FOR A WHILE NOW, I'VE BEEN WANTING TO, UM...

154
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,852
OH...

00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,854
THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT. LOOK AT

00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,862
?? TOP OF THE WORLD LOOKIN' ??

161
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,864

162
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:10,370
?? AND THE ONLY EXPLANATION I CAN FIND... ??

163
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,372
LISTEN, IF YOU WANT THIS CART

164
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,375
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE ME WITH IT!

165
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,380
YES!

166
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,381
DID YOU SEE THAT!?

167
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,382
YOU WERE INCREDIBLE!

168
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,384
A BRAND NEW WOMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

169
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,886
I COULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT YOU.

170
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:27,887
NO, IT'S JUST...

171
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,395
OKAY, UM, UH...

OH!

174
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,400
OH!

175
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,901
I'M FINE. I'M FINE.

176
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,403
YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO TELL ME

177
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,904
YOU EVER HAD FEELINGS FOR ME.

178
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,905
WHAT?

179
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,407
I WAS DOING GREAT WITH JULIE

180
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,908
BEFORE I FOUND OUT ABOUT YOU.

181
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,411
I WAS DOING GREAT BEFORE I FOUND OUT ABOUT YOU.

182
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,413
YOU THINK IT'S EASY FOR ME TO SEE YOU WITH JULIE?

183
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,416
THE POINT IS, I... I DON'T NEED THIS RIGHT NOW.

184
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,418
OKAY? IT'S IT'S TOO LATE.

185
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,420
I'M WITH SOMEBODY ELSE; I'M HAPPY.

186
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,921
THIS SHIP HAS SAILED.

187
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,922
FINE. GO AND DO THAT.

188
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,424
FINE. FINE.

189
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,925
I DON'T NEED YOUR STUPID SHIP!

190
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,926
GOOD.

191
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,431
OH!

192
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,433

193
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,477
ROSS, DO YOU REALIZE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE

194
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,978
I'M DOING SOMETHING I ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT?

195
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,980
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE

196
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,483
I'M DOING SOMETHING THAT I'M ACTUALLY GOOD AT?

197
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,484
IF YOU DON'T GET THAT...

198
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,985
HEY, I GET THAT.

199
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,487
I GET THAT BIG TIME, AND I'M HAPPY FOR YOU

200
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,988
BUT I'M TIRED OF HAVING A RELATIONSHIP

201
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,989
WITH YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE.

202
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,491
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.

203
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,992
WELL, NEITHER DO I!

204
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,494
IS THIS ABOUT MARK?

205
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,995

206
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:16,996
OH, MY GOD!

207
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,997
OKAY, IT'S NOT.

208
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:18,998
OH, MY GOD!

209
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,000
I CANNOT KEEP HAVING

210
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,003
THIS SAME FIGHT OVER AND OVER AGAIN, ROSS.

211
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,005
NO, YOU'RE MAKING THIS TOO HARD!

212
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,006
I'M MAKING THIS TOO HARD?

213
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,508
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

214
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,009
I DON'T KNOW! I DON'T KNOW!

215
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,512
LOOK, MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST TAKE A BREAK.

216
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,514
YOU'RE RIGHT. LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

217
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,015
LET'S COOL OFF, OKAY?

218
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,518
LET'S GET SOME FROZEN YOGURT OR SOMETHING.

219
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,519
NO...

220
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,020

221
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,022
A BREAK FROM US.

222
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,528
DO I KNOW WHY WE'RE RUSHING?

223
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,029
YEAH. YOU KNOW THE GIRLFRIEND

224
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,531
I TOLD YOU ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

225
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,032
WELL, IT TURNS OUT

226
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,034
THAT SHE WANTS TO GET BACK TOGETHER WITH ME...

227
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,536
OH, I FOUND IT!

228
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,538
THAT'S SO GREAT FOR YOU GUYS!

229
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,539
YEAH.

230
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,040
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

231
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,542
OH, THANK YOU.

232
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,543
I... HEY!

233
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,044

234
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,047
RACHEL!

235
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,049
HI!

236
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,552
OH... YOU GOT MY MESSAGE, HUH?

237
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,554
YEAH. OH, YOU ARE RIGHT ON TIME!

238
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,056
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY-- CAN I BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND AGAIN?

239
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,058
YES, YOU CAN, VERY MUCH.

240
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,561
AH...!

241
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,564
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE. JUST GET OUT!

242
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,566
I WANT TO STAY. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

243
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,068
ALL RIGHT. HOW WAS SHE?

244
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,570
UH OH.

245
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,074
WH WHAT?

246
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,576
WAS SHE GOOD?

247
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,577
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

248
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,580
ROSS, YOU SAID

249
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,081
YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT.

250
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,583
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT! HOW WAS SHE?

251
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,585
SHE WAS...

252
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,586
AWFUL.

253
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,087
HORRIBLE. NOT GOOD.

254
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,589
NOTHING COMPARED TO YOU.

255
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,591
SHE WAS DIFFERENT.

256
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,092
UH OH! OOH!

257
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,095
GOOD DIFFERENT?

258
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,598
NOBODY LIKES CHANGE.

259
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,599
I...

260
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,601
JUST STOP THAT!

261
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,102
WHAT? OKAY! OKAY!

262
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,605
THE WAY YOU OWNED UP TO EVERYTHING

263
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:10,109
IT JUST SHOWED ME HOW MUCH YOU'VE GROWN, YOU KNOW?

264
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,613
I MEAN, MY MOM NEVER THOUGHT THIS WOULD WORK OUT.

265
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,114

266
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,618
SHE WAS ALL, "ONCE A CHEATER, ALWAYS A CHEATER."

267
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,120
MM HMM.

268
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,122
OH... I JUST WISH

269
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,625
WE HADN'T LOST THOSE FOUR MONTHS.

270
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,127
BUT IF TIME WAS WHAT YOU NEEDED

271
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,130
JUST TO GAIN A LITTLE PERS PEC TIVE...

272
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,633
THAT'S...

273
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,136
WE WERE ON A BREAK!

274
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,148
YOU SEEM TO REALLY LIKE HER.

275
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,150
YEAH, BUT WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

276
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,652
WE BOTH AGREED IT WAS GOING TO BE

277
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,154
A TWO WEEK THING, YOU KNOW-- NO COMMITMENT.

278
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,658
ROSS, THAT GIRL JUST SPENT THE ENTIRE EVENING

279
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,159
TALKING TO YOUR FRIENDS

280
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,662
YOU ASKING TO HEAR  STORIES ABOUT

281
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,164
LOOKING THROUGH MONICA'S PHOTO ALBUMS...

282
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,166
I MEAN, YOU DON'T DO THAT

283
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,669
IF YOU'RE JUST IN IT FOR TWO WEEKS.

284
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,671
YOU THINK? HUH.

285
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,673
YOU'VE GOT, LIKE, 14 HOURS

286
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,675
UNTIL SHE HAS TO BE AT THE AIRPORT

287
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,678
AND YOU'RE SITTING HERE IN A HALLWAY WITH A...

288
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,181
28 YEAR OLD CHEERLEADER WITH A FAT LIP.

289
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,684

290
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,686
HEY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

291
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,187
YEAH.

292
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,195

293
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,201
OH, THIS IS SO AMAZING.

294
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,703
I CAN'T BELIEVE

295
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,706
MY BROTHER'S GETTING MARRIED AND IN LONDON.

296
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,207
I MEAN, IT'S SO ROMANTIC.

297
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,210
HEY, PRETTY SMART.

298
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,712
TISSUE PAPER.

299
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,214
YOU'RE AT THE WEDDING, YOU HAVE TO CRY...

300
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,215
"HANDKERCHIEF?"

301
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,217
"NO. I GOT MY INVITATION."

302
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,221
OH, LOOK! ISN'T THIS ADORABLE?

303
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,224
ROSS LET BEN ADDRESS MINE.

304
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,225
HELLO.

305
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,227
HEY. HEY.

306
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,229
HEY, DID YOU GET YOUR INVITATION

307
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,230
TO ROSS'S WEDDING?

308
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,732
NO.

309
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,233
WELL, DON'T WORRY, MAN.

310
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,235
I GET TO BRING A GUEST.

311
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,236
WE'LL SHOW HIM.

312
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,738
SO JEALOUS YOU'RE ALL GOING.

313
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,239
I CAN'T BELIEVE I NEVER KNEW

314
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,742
THAT YOU CAN'T FLY IN YOUR THIRD TRIMESTER.

315
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,243
I DIDN'T KNOW EITHER.

316
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,245
I KNEW THAT.

317
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,747
SO DIDN'T KNOW THAT

318
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,250
BUT YOU SHOULD SEE YOUR FACES.

319
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,251
HI, GUYS. WHAT'S UP?

320
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,252
HEY. HEY.

321
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,254
WE'RE HANGING OUT.

322
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,260
WHAT'S THIS?

323
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,262
IS THIS ROSS'S WEDDING INVITATION?

324
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:47,266
SEE, MAYBE THAT'S THE ONE WE SHOULD HAVE ACTUALLY HIDDEN.

325
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,268
OH, NO, NO. GUYS, COME ON.

326
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,770
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

327
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,772
I'M HAPPY FOR HIM.

328
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,775
I AM. I REALLY... I'M... I...

329
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,777
I'LL WORK ON IT.

330
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,779
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

331
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,780
MMM.

332
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,283
RACHEL, YOU'RE GOING TO COME THOUGH, AREN'T YOU?

333
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,785
NEY OH, HO

334
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,786
I DON'T KNOW. I...

335
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,287
THIS ISN'T ONE OF THOSE, YOU KNOW

336
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,789
"SHE DOESN'T COME, WE DON'T COME," RIGHT?

337
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,791
BECAUSE I ALREADY BOUGHT MY TICKET...

338
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,292
DUDE, YOU'RE NOT EVEN INVITED.

339
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,297
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE REAL WEIRD...

340
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,298
IS IF YOU WEREN'T THERE.

341
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,300
JUST SAY YOU'LL THINK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

342
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,303
NO, I'LL THINK ABOUT IT. YEAH.

343
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,307
WHO'S THIS FROM?

344
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,308
OH, THAT'S ROSS'S.

345
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,810
OH.

346
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,311

347
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,816
OH, MY GOD.

348
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,819
HE REMEMBERED!

349
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,820
REMEMBERED WHAT?

350
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,321
IT WAS LIKE MONTHS AGO.

351
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,323
WE WERE WALKING  BY THIS ANTIQUE STORE

352
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,325
AND I SAW THIS PIN IN THE WINDOW

353
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,327
AND I TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS JUST LIKE

354
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,830
ONE MY GRANDMOTHER HAD WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

355
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,833
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE HE REMEMBERED.

356
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,835
THIS MUST HAVE COST HIM A FORTUNE.

357
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,836
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE DID THIS.

358
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,838
ROSS? REMEMBER BACK IN COLLEGE

359
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,339
WHEN HE FELL IN LOVE WITH CAROL

360
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,841
AND BOUGHT HER

361
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,843
THAT RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE CRYSTAL DUCK?

362
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,344
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

363
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,354

364
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,859
OH... MY GOD.

365
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,360
 Flight 457

366
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,362
from Beijing now arriving.

367
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,367
OH, MY GOD.

368
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,869
ROSS AND I WERE IN GRAD SCHOOL.

369
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,370
 WE HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER

370
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,371
SINCE THEN.

371
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,873
WELL, I LAND IN CHINA.

372
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,374
GUESS WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THE DIG.

373
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,876
JULIE!

374
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,879
JULIE, ISN'T THAT GREAT?

375
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,380
I MEAN, ISN'T THAT JUST

376
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,884
KICK YOU IN THE CROTCH, SPIT ON YOUR NECK FANTASTIC?

377
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,889
OH, THAT IS SO SWEET.

378
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,391
NO...

379
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,392

380
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,393
NO, OKAY.

381
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,895
NO, YOU HANG UP.

382
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,897
NO, YOU... OKAY.

383
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,898
OKAY.

384
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,400
ONE, TWO, THREE.

385
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,404
WELL, YOU DIDN'T HANG UP EITHER.

386
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,907
SHE DIDN'T HANG UP. SHE DIDN'T HANG UP.

387
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,913
OKAY, NO.  NO, YOU HANG UP.

388
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,415
YOU, YOU, YOU...

389
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,421
ROSS?

390
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,423
HI. IT'S RACHEL.

391
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,928
I'M JUST CALLING TO SAY THAT, UM, EVERYTHING'S FINE

392
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,430
AND I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU

393
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,933
AND YOUR CAT.

394
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,939
SO, OBVIOUSLY, I AM OVER YOU.

395
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,942
I AM OVER YOU

396
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:48,447
AND THAT, MY FRIEND, IS WHAT THEY CALL "CLOSURE."

397
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,952
RACHEL, GOT A MESSAGE FROM YOU.

398
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,953
OH, MY GOD, ROSS, NO.

399
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:54,954
HANG UP THE PHONE.

400
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,455
GIVE ME THE PHONE.

401
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,957
GIVE ME THE GOD DAMNED PHONE!

402
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,458
GIVE ME THE PHONE.

403
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,467
YOU'RE OVER ME?

404
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:09,969
OH, GOD.

405
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,970
WHAT, YOU'RE, UH...

406
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:11,971
OH, GOD.

407
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,472
Y YOU'RE OVER ME?

408
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,477
WHEN WERE YOU...

409
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,479
UNDER ME?

410
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,482
WELL... BASICALLY...

411
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,984

412
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,987
LATELY, I'VE, UH...

413
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,991
I'VE, UH, SORT OF HAD FEELINGS FOR YOU.

414
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,492
OKAY, I NEED TO LIE DOWN.

415
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,495
HE BROKE UP WITH JULIE.

416
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,997

417
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,000
WELL, GO HUG HER, FOR GOD'S SAKES!

418
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,502
REALLY?

419
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,004
REALLY.

420
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,007
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN YOU, RACH.

421
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,508
OH, GOD.

422
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,017
OH... OH...

423
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,020
LISTEN, I'M SORRY, I HAD TO WORK TONIGHT.

424
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,522
OH, THAT'S OKAY.

425
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,024
YOU WERE WORTH THE WAIT.

426
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,025
OH.

427
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,528
AND I DON'T JUST MEAN TONIGHT.

428
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,531
?? I NEVER DREAMED ??

429
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,534
?? THAT I'D MEET SOMEBODY LIKE YOU ??

430
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:22,541
?? I NEVER DREAMED THAT I... ??

431
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,043
WHAT... AH...

432
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,555
OH, GOD!

433
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,558
OH, HONEY...

434
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,060
OH, IT'S OKAY.

435
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,563
OH, NO, YOU JUST ROLLED OVER THE JUICE BOX.

436
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,068
GUNTHER, PLEASE TELL ME

437
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,070
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO RACHEL

438
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,572
ABOUT ME AND THE GIRL FROM THE COPY PLACE.

439
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,573
I'M SORRY.

440
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,576
WAS I NOT SUPPOSED TO?

441
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,085
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO ENDED IT, REMEMBER?

442
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,087
YEAH, BECAUSE I WAS MAD AT YOU

443
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,089
NOT BECAUSE I STOPPED LOVING YOU.

444
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,591
YOU STILL LOVE ME?

445
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,094
NO.

446
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,595
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

447
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,097
WHAT ARE YOU...?

448
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,099
DO YOU WANT TO... GET BACK TOGETHER?

449
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,101
NO... MAYBE.

450
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,602
I DON'T...

451
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,604
I DON'T KNOW.

452
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,607
I JUST... I FEEL...

453
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,118
I CAN'T BELIEVE I EVEN THOUGHT

454
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,120
OF GETTING BACK TOGETHER WITH YOU.

455
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,121
WE ARE SO OVER!

456
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,123
OH... OH... UH...

457
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,125
FINE BY ME!

458
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,627
NOW AND HEY, JUST SO YOU K

459
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,129
IT'S NOT THAT COMMON

460
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,131
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO EVERY GUY

461
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,633
AND IT IS A BIG DEAL!

462
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,636
I KNEW IT!

463
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,149
Rachel's coming out.

464
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,152
Doesn't she look pretty, Jack?

465
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,653
OH, MY GOD!

466
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,156
THIS IS US GETTING READY FOR THE PROM.

467
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,157
OH!

468
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,658
WE DON'T HAVE TO WATCH THIS.

469
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:20,659
YEAH, WE DO.

470
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,161
COME ON! COME ON!

471
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,662
 Get a shot of Monica.

472
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,165
 WAIT. HOW DO YOU ZOOM OUT?

473
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,167
THERE SHE IS.

474
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,168
WHOA!

475
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,169
SHUT UP!

476
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,671
THE CAMERA ADDS TEN POUNDS.

477
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,674
SO, HOW MANY CAMERAS ARE ACTUALLY ON YOU?

478
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,677
 Dad, turn it off!

479
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,678
 IT IS OFF.

480
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,180
IT'S NOT.

481
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,181
 RIGHT, ROSS?

482
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,185
OH, COME ON.

483
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,687
LOOKING GOOD, MR. KOTTER.

484
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,692
I CAN'T GO TO MY OWN PROM WITHOUT A DATE.

485
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,694
I CAN'T. IT'S TOO LATE.

486
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,697
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING, I DON'T WANT TO GO EITHER.

487
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,200
I HAVE A WONDERFUL IDEA.

488
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,202
YOU SHOULD TAKE RACHEL TO THE PROM.

489
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,204
WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH. LET'S TURN IT OFF.

490
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,705
NO, NO, I WANT TO SEE.

491
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,207
WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO WATCH.

492
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,708
 Come on, kid.

493
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,210
LET'S GO.

494
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,711
 ARE YOU HANDSOME.

495
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,213
 LET'S SHOW THEM!

496
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,217

497
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,718
OKAY, DAD.

498
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,220
RACHEL, READY OR NOT

499
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,222
HERE COMES YOUR KNIGHT IN SHINING...

500
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,723
OH, NO.

501
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,725
BYE! DON'T WAIT UP!

502
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,227
OKAY, CHIP!

503
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,728
LET'S  GO.

504
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,730
 OH, DEAR.

505
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,733
JACK, HOW DO I TURN THIS OFF?

506
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,737
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THAT.

507
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,740
YEAH, WELL...

508
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,260
SEE? HE'S HER LOBSTER.

509
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,770
NO!

510
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,772
YOU'RE REALLY NOT GOING?

511
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,275
YEAH.

512
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,777
IT'S JUST GOING TO BE TOO HARD.

513
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:23,282
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, IT'S ROSS.

514
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,785
HOW CAN I WATCH HIM GET MARRIED?

515
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,287
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST...

516
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,788
IT'S FOR THE BEST, YOU KNOW?

517
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,290
IT IS. IT'S...

518
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,792
PLUS, SOMEBODY'S GOT TO STAY HERE WITH PHOEBE.

519
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,295
YOU KNOW, SHE'S GOING TO PRETTY BIG BY THEN

520
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,298
AND SHE'LL NEED SOMEONE TO HELP HER TIE HER SHOES.

521
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,301
DRIVE HER TO THE HOSPITAL

522
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,802
IN CASE SHE GOES INTO LABOR...

523
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,306
YOU DON'T HAVE A CAR, AND YOUR LICENSE EXPIRED.

524
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,807
I KNOW.

525
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,310
YEAH, SEE, THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO

526
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,312
AND I HAVE SO LITTLE TIME TO DO IT IN.

527
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,218
ALL RIGHT, CHECK THIS OUT--

528
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,220
SAYS HERE THERE'S A PLACE YOU CAN GO

529
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,822
TO RENT VIDEOS OF ALL THE MUSEUMS.

530
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,825
"IT'S ALMOST AS GOOD AS BEING THERE."

531
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,327
IT'S BETTER.

532
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,829
YOU CAN'T GO TO A MUSEUM IN YOUR UNDERWEAR.

533
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:14,333
WELL, YOU COULD, BUT PROBABLY JUST THE ONE TIME.

534
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,337
I BET WE COULD GET VIDEOS OF ALL THE SIGHTS.

535
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,339
GET A VCR IN OUR HOTEL ROOM

536
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,341
WE'D NEVER EVEN HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE.

537
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,843
IF WE DO THAT, WE'VE GOT TO RENT DIE HARD.

538
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:29,848
OH HO, I BET THE BRITISH VERSION IS GOOD.
