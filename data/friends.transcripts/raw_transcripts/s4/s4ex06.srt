1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,504
THANK YOU FOR THE DELICIOUS DINNER.

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,506
YOU'RE WELCOME FOR THE DELICIOUS DINNER.

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,508
HEY! WHAT ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING AT?

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,511
 ROSS AND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD.

5
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,513
YEAH, COME TO PAPA!

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,520
I KNOW!

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,523
PROBABLY THE ONLY TIME I'LL EVER SAY THIS

8
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,526
BUT DID YOU SEE THE ASS ON HER?

9
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,028
WHERE DID YOU...?

10
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,029
WHEN DID YOU...?

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,030
HOW DID YOU...?

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,532
HOW DID YOU GET A GIRL LIKE THAT?

13
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,035
YEAH, SO, WHAT IS SHE...

14
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,536
LIKE, A SPOKES MODEL?

15
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,038
AEROBICS INSTRUCTOR? WHAT?

16
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,041
ACTUALLY, SHE'S A PALEONTOLOGY DOCTORAL CANDIDATE

17
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,044
SPECIALIZING IN THE CENOZOIC ERA.

18
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,047
OKAY, BUT THAT'S, LIKE, THE EASIEST ERA.

19
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,549
I'VE SEEN HER AT WORK

20
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,051
BUT I ALWAYS FIGURED...

21
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,552

22
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:56,056
BUT, UH, I MADE HER DINNER

23
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,557
WE HAD A GREAT TIME

24
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,060
AND WE'RE GOING OUT AGAIN TOMORROW.

25
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,064
MAYBE SHE AND HER FRIENDS ARE HAVING A CONTEST

26
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,566
TO SEE WHO BRINGS HOME THE BIGGEST GEEK.

27
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,567
FINE BY ME.

28
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,069
HOPE SHE WINS.

29
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,073
HEY, WE SHOULD HAVE A CONTEST.

30
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,574
CAN YEAH. SEE WHO

31
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,077
BRING HOME THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

32
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,078
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, JOE.

33
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,579
WE COULD CALL IT "LIFE."

46
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:09,295
YOU GUYS HAVE ANY WRAPPING PAPER?

47
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,799
OH! IS IT FOR MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT?

48
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,635
PHEEBS, IT WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY, LIKE, MONTHS AGO.

49
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,638
YEAH, BUT REMEMBER YOU SAID YOU ORDERED SOMETHING SPECIAL

50
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,141
AND IT JUST HADN'T COME YET?

51
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,644
WELL, I HAVE A CALL IN ABOUT THAT.

52
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,146
OH, OKAY.

53
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,648
ACTUALLY, THIS IS FOR KATHY'S BIRTHDAY.

54
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,151
IT'S AN EARLY EDITION OF HER FAVORITE BOOK.

55
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,152
OH!

56
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,154
THE VELVETEEN RABBIT.

57
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,656
OH, MY GOD. WHEN THE BOY'S LOVE MAKES THE RABBIT REAL...

58
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,158
OKAY, BUT DON'T TOUCH IT

59
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,660
BECAUSE YOUR FINGERS HAVE DESTRUCTIVE OILS.

60
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,661
OH.

61
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,663
WELL, THEN YOU BETTER KEEP IT AWAY

62
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,166
FROM ROSS'S HAIR.

63
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,667
THIS IS PRETTY RARE.

64
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,169
HOW DID YOU GET THAT?

65
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,170
OH, IT WASN'T A BIG DEAL.

66
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,672
I JUST WENT TO A COUPLE OF BOOKSTORES

67
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,174
TALKED TO A COUPLE OF DEALERS

68
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,176
CALLED A COUPLE OF THE AUTHOR'S GRANDCHILDREN.

69
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,178
AW, HONEY, THAT'S SO SWEET.

70
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,180
YEAH, AND WHAT A GREAT WAY

71
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,182
TO SAY, "I SECRETLY LOVE YOU

72
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,683
ROOMMATE'S GIRLFRIEND."

73
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,685
IT DOESN'T SAY THAT.

74
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,687
DOES IT?

75
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,691
HOW DO YOU THINK IT WILL LOOK WHEN YOU GET HER

76
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,194
SOMETHING INCREDIBLY MEANINGFUL AND EXPENSIVE

77
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,195
AND HER BOYFRIEND JOEY

78
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,696
GIVES HER AN ORANGE?

79
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,198
OKAY, I'LL JUST MAKE SURE

80
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,700
JOEY GETS HER SOMETHING REALLY GREAT.

81
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,203
IT'S GOT TO BE BETTER THAN THAT BOOK.

82
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,704
OOH! LIKE A CROSSBOW!

83
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,207
YEAH.

84
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,708
ONCE AGAIN, I AM SORRY.

85
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,210
THANK YOU.

86
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,211
BYE.

87
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,713
I JUST HAD TO TURN DOWN A JOB

88
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,715
CATERING A FUNERAL FOR 60 PEOPLE.

89
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,717
OH, MY GOD!

90
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,219
WHAT HAPPENED?

91
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,221
60 GUESTS.

92
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,226
SO, UH, WHY'D YOU HAVE TO TURN IT DOWN?

93
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,727
BECAUSE  I DON'T HAVE

94
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,229
THE MONEY OR EQUIPMENT

95
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,730
TO HANDLE SOMETHING THAT BIG

96
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,232
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

97
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,233
THERE'S NO WAY.

98
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,235
WHAT IS WITH ALL THE NEGATIVITY?

99
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,238
YOU SOUND LIKE "MONICAN'T", NOT "MONICAN."

100
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,243
"MONICA."

101
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,245
YOU HAVE BEEN PLAYING AROUND WITH CATERING

102
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,246
FOR OVER THREE YEARS.

103
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,748
DO YOU WANT TO BE A CATERER OR NOT?

104
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,250
I DON'T KNOW.

105
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,252
THERE YOU GO! THAT'S THE SPIRIT!

106
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,753
NOW, IF YOU NEED MONEY

107
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,256
I WILL LEND YOU MONEY

108
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,758
BUT JUST GET MOVING!

109
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,761
REALLY? I NEED $500 FOR FOOD AND SUPPLIES AND STUFF.

110
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,264
IT'S WORTH IT IF IT'LL GET YOU MOVING.

111
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,266
YOU HAVEN'T WORKED IN MONTHS.

112
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,767
YOU'RE NOT WORKING EITHER.

113
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,270
YES, BUT I'M DOING THIS.

114
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,771
THAT'D BE GREAT.

115
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,772
THANK YOU.

116
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,274
HEY.

117
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,776
HEY! HEY.

118
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,280
CAN I BORROW THE KEYS TO YOUR APARTMENT?

119
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,281
WHY?

120
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,782

121
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,783

122
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,785
YOU CAN PEE HERE!

123
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,289

124
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,290
YES, I CAN.

125
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,291
OF COURSE.

126
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,792
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

127
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,793
IT'S OKAY.

128
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,296
THE DUCK'S USING OUR BATHROOM ANYWAY.

129
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,798
HEY, JOE

130
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,801
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING KATHY FOR HER BIRTHDAY?

131
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,803
WE'VE ONLY GONE OUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

132
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,805
YOU THINK I GOT TO GET HER SOMETHING?

133
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,808
YES. YOU HAVE TO GET HER SOMETHING REALLY NICE.

134
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,310
OH! I KNOW.

135
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,312
AND NOT ONE OF YOUR COUPONS

136
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,314
FOR AN HOUR OF "JOEY LOVE."

137
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,321
OOH! A CROSSWORD! CAN I HELP?

138
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,822
NO!

139
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,324
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

140
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,326
LAST WEEK, I GOT ALL BUT THREE ANSWERS.

141
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,328
I WANT TO FINISH ONE WITHOUT HELP.

142
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,329
FINE.

143
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,332
BUT YOU CAN'T HELP ME DEVELOP

144
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,334
MY NEW UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE.

145
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,835
HEY.

146
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,836
HOW'D IT GO?

147
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:37,837
OH, MY GOD!

148
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,839
IT WAS THE BEST FUNERAL EVER!

149
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,341
EVERYONE LOVED THE FOOD

150
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,342
AND GUESS WHAT?

151
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,843
I GOT ANOTHER FUNERAL TOMORROW--

152
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,346
THE DEAD GUY FROM TODAY'S BEST FRIEND.

153
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,850
IT IS LIKE I AM THE OFFICIAL CATERER

154
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,851
FOR THAT ACCIDENT.

155
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,853
GOD, I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU!

156
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,854
OH, THANKS.

157
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,856
CHECK OUT MY NEW CATERING STUFF.

158
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,857

159
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,359
LOOK! I'M AN OMELET STATION!

160
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,861
"OMELET, MADE TO ORDER."

161
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,863
I'LL HAVE ONE, PLEASE.

162
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,365
PLUS MY MONEY.

163
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,366
OH.

164
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,369
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU NEEDED IT BACK RIGHT AWAY.

165
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,871
YOU TOLD ME TO GO BE A CATERER.

166
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,373
SO I WENT, I BE'D.

167
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,375
I USED IT TO BUY

168
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,377
ALL THIS STUFF.

169
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,878
"ABORIGINE!"

170
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,882
OH... NO.

171
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,384
I GOT ANOTHER JOB TOMORROW.

172
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,387
I'LL PAY YOU BACK WITH THE MONEY FROM THAT.

173
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,888
OH! OKAY.

174
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,890
OOH, SORRY I ACTED LIKE A BANK.

175
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,394
"ABORIGINE!"

176
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,396
OH, NO, I TRIED THAT ALREADY.

177
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,408
HMM...

178
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,409
UM...

179
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,911
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN?

180
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:56,416
DID HOMO ERECTUSHUNT WITH WOODEN TOOLS?

181
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,919
ACCORDING TO RECENT FINDINGS.

182
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,920

183
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,422

184
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,431
HERE, MITZI!

185
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,433
HERE, MITZI.

186
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,934
UH...

187
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,936
MITZI IS...?

188
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,937
MY HAMSTER.

189
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,439
I HOPE SHE'S OKAY.

190
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,941
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN A WHILE.

191
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,943
HAVE A SEAT.

192
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,945

193
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,946
UH...

194
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,947
OH, HEY!

195
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,449
DO YOU, UH...

196
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,452

197
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,954
DO YOU HAVE ANY, UM...

198
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,456
CINNAMON FRUIT TOASTIES?

199
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,457
WHAT?

200
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,459
WELL, I DO.

201
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,463
WHY DON'T WE GO BACK TO MY PLACE

202
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,465
LIGHT A COUPLE OF CANDLES

203
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,467
BREAK OPEN A BOX OF CINNAMON FRUIT TOASTIES.

204
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:49,969
I'D RATHER NOT.

205
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,471
OH, YEAH?

206
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,472
WHY NOT?

207
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,473
OKAY, UM...

208
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,975
DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY

209
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,979
BUT YOUR PLACE KIND OF HAS A WEIRD SMELL.

210
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,987
IS EVERYTHING IN THE CAR?

211
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,490
YEP. DID YOU SETTLE THE BILL?

212
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,491
NO.

213
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,992
I HATE THIS PART.

214
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,995
OH! LOOK WHAT WE ALMOST LEFT!

215
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,497
THAT'S NOT MINE.

216
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,498
OH, ALL RIGHT.

217
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,000
OOH! LOOK WHAT WE ALMOST TOOK!

218
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,508
EXCUSE ME, MS. BURKART.

219
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,011
WELL, WE'RE ALL CLEANED UP IN THE KITCHEN.

220
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,013
OH, GOOD.

221
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,516
THANK YOU.

222
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,517
UM...

223
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,518

224
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,520
AND, WELL, THERE'S JUST...

225
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,523
THE SMALL MATTER OF THE, UM...

226
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,524
DEAR?

227
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,025
JUST THE MATTER OF...

228
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,027
THE PAYMENT?

229
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:53,533
JACK USED TO HANDLE THE FINANCES.

230
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,536

231
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,540
DID YOU GET IT?

232
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,042
NO, BUT I MADE A WIDOW CRY.

233
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,544
SEE YOU IN HELL.

234
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,554
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD ALL DO?

235
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,556
GO SEE A MUSICAL.

236
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,059
SURE.

237
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,561
AND YOU KNOW

238
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,062
WHICH ONE WE SHOULD SEE?

239
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,567
THE 1996 TONY AWARD WINNER.

240
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,069
I MEAN, THAT ONE'S GOT TO BE GOOD.

241
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,571
DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW

242
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,573
THE NAME OF THAT ONE?

243
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,575
I DON'T KNOW, UH...

244
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,076
GREASE?

245
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,078
NO.

246
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,081
RENT?

247
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,082
YES!

248
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,584
RENT.

249
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,587
OKAY, SO WHEN DO YOU WANT TO GO?

250
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,087
WHAT?

251
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,089
OH, I'M SORRY, I CAN'T.

252
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,591
I'M BUSY.

253
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,594
HEY.

254
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,597
MAN, IT IS SO HARD TO SHOP FOR GIRLS.

255
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,599

256
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,602
YES, IT IS-- AT "OFFICE MAX."

257
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,105
WHAT DID YOU GET HER?

258
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,609
A PEN.

259
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,111
IT'S TWO GIFTS IN ONE.

260
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,114
IT'S A PEN THAT'S ALSO A CLOCK, HUH?

261
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,616
HA HA!

262
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,117
YOU CAN'T GIVE HER THAT.

263
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,118
WHY NOT?

264
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,620
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT 11!

265
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,121
AND IT'S NOT

266
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,123
THE SEVENTH NIGHT OF HANUKKAH!

267
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,130
HONEY, WHAT HE MEANS IS, WHILE THIS IS A VERY NICE GIFT

268
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,133
MAYBE IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING A BOYFRIEND GIVES?

269
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,134
SURE, IT IS.

270
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,136
SHE NEEDS A PEN FOR WORK

271
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,138
SHE'S WRITING, SHE TURNS IT OVER--

272
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,141
"WHOA! IT'S TIME FOR MY DATE WITH JOEY!"

273
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,146
LOOK, WHAT DID YOU GET FOR ANGELA DELVECCHIO

274
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,147
FOR HER BIRTHDAY?

275
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,650
SHE DIDN'T HAVE A BIRTHDAY WHILE

276
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,151
WE WERE GOING OUT.

277
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,653
FOR THREE YEARS?

278
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:58,658
WELL, LOOK, IT'S TOO LATE, AND I GOT AN AUDITION.

279
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,660
I CAN'T SHOP ANYMORE!

280
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,662
ALL RIGHT, I WILL GO OUT

281
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,665
AND I WILL TRY TO FIND SOMETHING FOR HER, OKAY?

282
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,166
THANKS, MAN.

283
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,169
OH, WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, COULD YOU GET HER A CARD?

284
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:14,674
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO WRITE HER A LITTLE POEM, AS WELL?

285
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,677
OR JUST GET A CARD  THAT HAS A POEM

286
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,679
ALREADY IN IT.

287
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,181
OH, SO IT'S A CARD

288
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,184
BUT IT'S ALSO A POEM HOLDER.

289
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,690
YOU HAVE TO GET OUR MONEY!

290
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,192
PHEEBS, SHE COULDN'T STOP CRYING.

291
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,696
WITH THOSE THICK GLASSES, HER TEARS LOOKED GIANT.

292
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,197
I KNOW IT'S TOUGH.

293
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,701
YOU KNOW THE FIRST THING I DID AFTER MY MOTHER'S FUNERAL?

294
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,702
WHAT?

295
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,203
PAID THE CATERER.

296
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,205
LOOK, I'VE HAD A LOT OF JOBS

297
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,707
AND THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE

298
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,710
WHO JUST ALWAYS TRY TO GET OUT OF PAYING.

299
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,713
IT'S EITHER, "THAT MASSAGE WASN'T LONG ENOUGH"

300
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,716
OR, "I DON'T RECOGNIZE ANY OF THOSE SONGS"

301
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,718
OR, "THESE SOMBREROS AREN'T BIG ENOUGH.

302
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,219
BAD LITTLE WHITE GIRL."

303
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,721
OKAY.

304
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,724
SO YOU... YOU THINK SHE'S FAKING?

305
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,726
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE WEREN'T ANY TEARS

306
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,227
TILL YOU SHOWED HER THE BILL.

307
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,730
PHOEBE, SHE SOUNDED PRETTY UPSET TO ME.

308
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,232
?? YOU'RE A GRAND OLD FLAG ??

309
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,734
?? YOU'RE A HIGH FLYIN' FLAG ??

310
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,737
?? AND FOREVER IN PEACE MAY YOU WAVE... ??

311
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,238
SHE SEEMS FINE NOW.

312
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,239
?? THE LAND I LOVE  ??

313
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,241
?? THE HOME OF  ??

314
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,744
??THE FREE AND THE BRAVE.??

315
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,745
SO YOU JUST LEFT?

316
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,747
HER PLACE WAS REALLY THAT BAD?

317
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,250
YOU KNOW HOW YOU THROW YOUR JACKET ON A CHAIR

318
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,752
AT THE END OF THE DAY?

319
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,754
LIKE THAT, ONLY INSTEAD OF A CHAIR

320
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,755
IT'S A PILE OF GARBAGE.

321
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,259
AND INSTEAD OF A JACKET, IT'S A PILE OF GARBAGE.

322
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,261
AND INSTEAD OF

323
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,763
THE END OF THE DAY

324
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,264
IT'S THE END OF TIME

325
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,767
AND GARBAGE IS ALL THAT HAS SURVIVED.

326
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,770
HERE.

327
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,772
WOW. THANKS.

328
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,774
SO, UH, WHAT HAPPENED?

329
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,775
NOTHING HAPPENED.

330
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,276
I HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE.

331
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,779
ALL RIGHT. NEXT TIME, YOU TAKE HER TO YOUR PLACE.

332
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,280
NO. I TRIED THAT.

333
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,782
SHE SAYS IT HAS A WEIRD SMELL.

334
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,784
WHAT KIND OF SMELL?

335
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,286
I DON'T KNOW-- SOAP?!

336
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,788
ALL RIGHT. LISTEN, ROSS.

337
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,289
YOU LIKE THIS GIRL, RIGHT?

338
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,291
YOU WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN? YEAH.

339
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,293
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO DO IT

340
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,295
IN THE MESS!

341
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,798
YEAH, OKAY. YOU'RE RIGHT.

342
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,799
YEAH.

343
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,802
I MEAN, UH, WHO CARES ABOUT A LITTLE SLOPPINESS?

344
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,804
YEAH. IT'S, UH...

345
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,806
IT'S ENDEARING, REALLY.

346
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,807
ALL RIGHT.

347
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,810
NOW, YOU GO GET THAT BEAUTIFUL PIG.

348
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,312

349
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,319
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

350
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,822
I JUST SPENT THE ENTIRE AFTERNOON

351
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,824
LOOKING FOR A PRESENT FOR KATHY

352
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,826
THAT WOULD BE BETTER THAN THE RABBIT.

353
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,327
ANY LUCK?

354
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,829
OH, YEAH.

355
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,330
I FOUND THIS GREAT PLACE CALLED

356
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,832
"INVISIBLE THINGS FOR KATHY."

357
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,334
CAN YOU GIVE ME A HAND WITH ALL THIS STUFF?

358
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,335
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

359
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,838
WHY DON'T YOU JUST RETURN THE BOOK

360
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,341
LET JOEY GIVE HER THE CLOCK PEN AND YOU GET HER SOMETHING

361
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,343
WORSE THAN THAT... LIKE A REGULAR PEN.

362
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,847
SHE'S REALLY GOING TO LOVE THIS, YOU KNOW?

363
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,850
THE BOTTOM LINE IS I WANT HER TO HAVE IT

364
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,352
EVEN IF I DON'T GET TO BE THE ONE

365
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,854
WHO GIVES IT TO HER.

366
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,356
OH, HONEY, THAT'S SO SWEET.

367
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,859
YEAH? YOU DON'T THINK IT'S JUST PATHETIC?

368
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,862
OOH! "PATHETIC."

369
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,366
HEY! I'M MEETING KATHY IN TEN MINUTES.

370
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,868
I BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU.

371
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:29,869
WHERE?

372
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,371
OUR PLACE, THE HALL!

373
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,873
I... WE...

374
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,376
I GOT SOMETHING FOR HER.

375
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,385
IT'S A BOOK.

376
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,887
A BOOK?

377
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,388

378
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,391
IS IT, LIKE, A BOOK THAT'S ALSO A SAFE?

379
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,895
IT'S A BOOK THAT'S JUST A BOOK.

380
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,397
IT'S AN EARLY EDITION OF THE VELVETEEN RABBIT.

381
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,399
IT WAS HER FAVORITE BOOK AS A KID.

382
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,402
SO, UH, JUST LET ME KNOW IF SHE LIKES IT, OKAY?

383
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,904
OH, YOU GOT IT. THANKS, MAN.

384
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,406
THANKS FOR DOING THIS. I OWE YOU ONE.

385
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,912
HEY! THERE WASN'T CHANGE FROM THAT 20, WAS THERE?

386
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,416
NO. IT CAME OUT TO AN EVEN 20.

387
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:19,919
WOW.

388
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,421
THAT'S ALMOST AS MUCH AS A NEW BOOK.

389
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,926

390
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,929
?? JEEPERS, CREEPERS ??

391
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,430
?? WHERE'D YOU GET THOSE PEEPERS? ??

392
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,432
?? JEEPERS, CREEPERS...??

393
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,435
YOU DIDN'T GET THE MONEY, DID YOU?

394
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,437
MAYBE I CAN TRY AT INTERMISSION?

395
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,940
OH, PHOEBE, COME ON.

396
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,441
LET'S JUST GO.

397
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,944
NO! HEY, WE'RE NOT LEAVING TILL WE GET PAID.

398
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,445
WHO DOES SHE THINK SHE IS?

399
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,447
I WAS TALKING TO THE FLORIST.

400
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,949
SHE DIDN'T GET PAID EITHER.

401
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,951
OR THE LIMO DRIVER, OR THE PRIEST--

402
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,954
AND HE CAN GET THE DEAD GUY DAMNED FOR ALL ETERNITY.

403
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,958
WELL, I... I'M NOT GOING BACK OUT THERE.

404
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,961
FINE. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

405
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,964
HEY, WIDOW.

406
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,966
?? COME ON ALONG AND LISTEN TO ?? WIDOW?

407
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,468
?? THE LULLABY OF... ?? EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME!

408
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,971
THANKS.

409
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,474
UM, CLEARLY, THIS IS A VERY, VERY HARD TIME FOR YOU

410
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,478
UM, BUT WE PROVIDED A SERVICE AND WE DESERVE TO BE PAID

411
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,480
BECAUSE YOU ATE THAT SERVICE

412
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,482
AND, UM, WE ARE NOT LEAVING HERE

413
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,484
UNTIL WE ARE PAID EVERY PENNY, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT, LADY?

414
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:30,489
WE'RE PART TIME CATERERS AND WE HAVE NO PLACE ELSE TO GO.

415
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,991
OH, ALL RIGHT.

416
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,993
I'LL GET MY BAG.

417
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,494
GOOD.

418
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,504
I'M GOING TO LEAVE SOME CARDS HERE.

419
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,509
PLEASE THINK OF US  FOR YOUR NEXT EVENT.

420
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,018
SO, YOU WANT TO COME INSIDE?

421
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,020
YES.

422
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,024
YES, I DO.

423
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,534
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

424
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,036
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.

425
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,063
GUESS WHO.

426
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,566
UH... DEPARTMENT OF SANITATION?

427
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,069
IT'S ME.

428
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,570
OH.

429
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,583
OH!

430
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,584
WHAT?

431
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,586
OH, CHERYL!

432
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,088
OH, ROSS!

433
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,091
OH! OH!

434
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,097

435
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,100
OH... GOD.

436
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,101

437
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,103

438
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,107
ROSS, NO!

439
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,108
NO, NO, NO!

440
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,109
IT'S MITZI. IT'S MY...

441
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,611
IT'S MY HAMSTER! IT'S MITZI!

442
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,113
OH, MY GOD.

443
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,115
I'M SO SORRY. I MUST HAVE FREAKED OUT.

444
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,617
OH, THANK GOD, IT'S NOT MITZI.

445
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,618

446
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,120
IT'S JUST A RAT.

447
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,125
I DID IT.

448
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,626
OH! I FINISHED IT!

449
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,628
I DID IT ALL BY MYSELF!

450
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,630
AND THERE'S NOBODY TO HUG.

451
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,132

452
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,633
MOVE!

453
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,140
HEY.

454
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,641
HEY, YOU GUYS!

455
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,144
I FINISHED THE CROSSWORD BY MYSELF. HUG ME.

456
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,146
YAY! THAT'S SO GOOD.

457
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,647
CONGRATULATIONS.

458
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,648
THANK YOU.

459
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,150
HOW'D THE CATERING GO?

460
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,151
OH, IT WAS GREAT.

461
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,652
THE WIDOW WOULDN'T PAY

462
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,154
SO PHOEBE YELLED AT HER TILL SHE DID.

463
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,657
YEAH. I'M A HARD ASS.

464
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,659
AND I'M A WUSS.

465
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,162
AND WE SHOULD BE PARTNERS.

466
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,663
YEAH-- HARD ASS AND WUSS.

467
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,165
WE COULD FIGHT CRIME.

468
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,169
WAIT A MINUTE, PHOEBE.

469
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,170
WE SHOULD BE PARTNERS.

470
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,172
WE SHOULD BE CATERING PARTNERS.

471
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,173
THINK ABOUT IT.

472
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,674
YOU'RE NOT WORKING RIGHT NOW

473
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,676
AND WE HAVE SUCH A GREAT TIME TOGETHER.

474
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,178
OKAY.

475
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,180
I COOK, YOU TAKE CARE OF THE MONEY.

476
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,182
OH! IT'LL BE LIKE I HAVE A WIFE IN THE '50s.

477
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,683

478
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,188
HEY.

479
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,190
HEY. HOW'D IT GO?

480
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,191
HOW'D SHE LIKE THE GIFT?

481
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,192
MAN, SHE LOVED IT.

482
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,194
SHE'S SHOWING MONICA AND RACHEL NOW.

483
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,695
OH, YEAH? THAT'S GREAT.

484
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,197
LISTEN. I GOT TO TELL YOU.

485
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,699
I FEEL KIND OF BAD TAKING CREDIT FOR THIS

486
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,701
BECAUSE, MAN, AM I GOING TO GET

487
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,203
A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THIS.

488
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,205

489
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,208
HEY.

490
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,709
HEY.

00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,711
HEY. HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

492
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,213
THANK YOU.

493
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,715
YOU KNOW, UH, CHANDLER GOT YOU A GIFT, TOO.

494
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,717
NO, HE DIDN'T.

495
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,221
YEAH, HE DID.

496
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,723
LOOK. IT'S RIGHT THERE ON THE COUNTER. HO HO HO!

497
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,732
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

498
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,734
I'M SORRY.

499
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,738
YOU REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO.

500
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,240
WOW.

501
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,742
SEE, YOU THINK IT'S JUST A PEN

502
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:47,246
BUT THEN YOU TURN IT OVER AND IT'S ALSO A CLOCK.

503
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,747
YEAH.

504
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,249
NO. THIS IS GREAT.

505
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,251
THANK YOU, CHANDLER.

506
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,253

00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,756
WANT TO GO TO BED?

509
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,759
I'LL BE IN IN A MINUTE.

510
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,766
OH, UH, DON'T FORGET YOUR COUPON.

511
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,274
GOOD NIGHT.

UM, THANK YOU FOR THE GIFT.

513
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,279
OH, UH, YEAH.

514
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,282
I JUST KNEW THAT SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE WRITING

515
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:27,286
YOU YOU DON'T ALWAYS KNOW THE EXACT TIME.

516
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,289
NO. I DIDN'T MEAN THE PEN.

517
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,790
THANK YOU FOR THE BOOK.

518
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,293
UH, THE BOOK?

519
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,794
THE VELVETEEN RABBIT?

520
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,297
I HAVE A FEELING YOU HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.

521
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,799
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

522
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,801
WELL, WHEN JOEY GAVE IT TO ME

523
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,305
HE SAID, "THIS IS BECAUSE I KNOW YOU LIKE RABBITS

524
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,307
AND I KNOW YOU LIKE CHEESE."

525
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,310
THANKS. I LOVE IT.

526
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,312
AND I KNOW HOW HARD IT MUST HAVE BEEN

527
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,313
FOR YOU TO FIND.

528
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,814
OH, WELL.

529
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,817
BY THE WAY, IN CASE YOU MISSED THAT, THAT SOUND WAS:

530
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,320
OH, WELL.

531
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,821
YOU MUST REALLY LIKE JOEY

532
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,324
TO GO TO ALL THAT TROUBLE FOR HIM.

533
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,825
OH, YEAH! HE'S MY...

534
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,332
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

535
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,336
WELL...

536
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,338
GOOD NIGHT.

537
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,849
HEY, THAT COUPON EXPIRES, YOU KNOW.

538
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,225

539
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:41,727
HI.

540
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:42,861
UH, YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

541
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,863
I'M MONICA GELLER, ROSS'S SISTER.

542
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,365
OH, YEAH. YOU KNOW, IT'S TOO BAD

543
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,366
THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

544
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:48,867
YEAH.

545
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,869
ANYWAY, HE TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR APARTMENT

546
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,870
AND, UM, WELL...

547
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,872
I COULDN'T SLEEP THINKING ABOUT IT.

548
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,375
SO, UH...

549
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,378
WOULD IT BE OKAY IF I CLEANED IT?

550
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,381
NO?

551
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,884
I WON'T BE ABLE TO SLEEP.
