00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,507

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,513
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

3
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,517
JOEY. JOEY.

4
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:21,021
JOEY. JOEY, JOEY, JOEY, JOEY, JOEY...

00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,524
JOEY... JOEY... JOEY.

00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,027
JOEY. JOEY!

7
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,030
ALL RIGHT!

8
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,537

9
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,544
OH, OH, DID DID... DID I WAKE YOU?

23
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,595
GUNTHER, COULD I GET

24
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,597
ANOTHER CUP OF COFFEE, PLEASE?

25
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,600
SO, UH, WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU' RE NOT WORKING HERE?

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,602
YOU DON'T NEED

27
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,604
TO FILL THESE SILENCES.

28
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,106
OH, OKAY, THANKS.

29
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,109
CHANDLER, THAT'S, LIKE

30
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,610
YOUR FOURTH CUP OF COFFEE.

31
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,112
OKAY, DO ME.

32
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,116
I'VE HAD A CERTAIN NUMBER OF JUICES.

33
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,620
WELL, I AM DRINKING LOTS OF CUPS OF COFFEE BECAUSE I AM EXHAUSTED

34
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,122
BECAUSE JOEY STARTED SNORING.

35
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,124
HE'S IN A DIFFERENT ROOM.

36
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,625
HE'S REALLY THAT LOUD?

37
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,127
OH, YOU SHOULD HEAR ME.

38
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,129
IT'S NOT SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF, OKAY?

39
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,630
YOU HAVE TO GO TO A SLEEP CLINIC.

40
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,632
LOOK, I TOLD YOU I'M NOT GOING TO ANY CLINIC.

41
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,633
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.

42
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,135
YOU'RE THE ONE WITH THE PROBLEM.

43
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,136
YOU SHOULD GO

44
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,139
TO A QUIT BEING A BABY- AND LEAVE ME ALONE CLINIC.

45
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,641
THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE.

46
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,642
YEAH, THEY DO.

47
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,145
QUIT BEING A BABY AND LEAVE ME ALONE.

48
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,646
THERE, YOU JUST HAD

49
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,148
YOUR FIRST CLASS.

50
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,150
YOU KNOW, I USED TO  GO OUT WITH THIS GUY

51
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,651
THAT WAS A REALLY LIGHT SLEEPER

52
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,153
AND WHENEVER I'D START TO SNORE

53
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,654
HE'D JUST ROLL ME OVER...

54
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,656
OH, YEAH...

55
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,659
HE WOULD JUST ROLL ME OVER

56
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,161
AND I WOULD STOP SNORING.

57
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,164
NEXT TIME YOU SNORE, I'M ROLLING YOU OVER.

58
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,665
I GOT TO DO WHAT I GOT TO DO.

59
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,667
YOU GOT TO DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.

60
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,669
HEY, GUYS.

61
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,670
HEY. HEY.

62
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,674

63
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,676
OH, THE OLYMPICS.

64
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,180
HAVE YOU GUYS PICKED A DATE YET?

65
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,182
HUH? OH, NO, NOT YET.

66
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,684
I STILL CANNOT BELIEVE YOU'RE ENGAGED.

67
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,186
JUST BECAUSE

68
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,189
IT'S HAPPENING SO FAST, NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A LOSER.

69
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,691
THANKS. UH, HAS ANYONE SEEN RACH?

70
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,194
OH, SHE'S UPSTAIRS NOT DOING THE DISHES.

71
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,695
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

72
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,697
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT DOING THEM THIS TIME.

73
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,200
I DON'T CARE IF THOSE DISHES JUST SIT IN THE SINK

74
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,701
UNTIL THEY'RE  ALL COVERED WITH...

75
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,203
I'LL DO THEM WHEN I GET HOME.

76
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,206
YEAH. OH, HEY, LISTEN

79
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,211
YEAH, BUT IT DIDN'T FIT.

80
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,213
WELL, LUCKILY, THERE'S A STORE HERE HAS ONE LEFT IN HER SIZE

00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:06,486

YOU'RE GOING TO A CLINIC...

205
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,505
AND A PAJAMA STORE.

206
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,512
DOES SHE USE THE CUPS?

207
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,514
YES, I BELIEVE SHE DOES.

208
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,518

209
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,520

00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,542

215
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,543
UH, JUST A SECOND!

216
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,545

217
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,546
PHOEBE?

00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,549
CAN YOU HOLD ON JUST ONE MINUTE?

220
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,552
NO, YOU HAVE TO LET ME IN RIGHT NOW!

221
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,053
ARE YOU ALONE?

222
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,555
YES.

223
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,556
ALL RIGHT.

224
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,560

225
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,061

226
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,566
THIS SUCKS.

227
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,568
I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD TO STAY UP ALL NIGHT

228
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,070
BEFORE I GO TO THIS STUPID SLEEP CLINIC.

229
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,572
I'M SO TIRED.

230
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,074
IT'S 6:00.

231
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,577
HI.

232
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,078
HEY, I HEAR THAT YOU AND JOSHUA

233
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,581
ARE GOING OUT TO DINNER WITH ROSS AND EMILY

234
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,083
AND I THINK THAT'S-- I THINK THAT'S REALLY COOL.

235
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,586
YEAH, RACHEL, I THINK YOU'RE HANDLING THAT

236
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,587
REALLY WELL.

237
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,589
WHAT DO YOU ME AN, "HANDLING" IT?

238
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,090
THERE'S NOTHING TO HANDLE.

239
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,593
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS

240
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,595
IF IT WASN'T FOR ME AND JOSHUA.

241
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,097
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET MARRIED ANYWAY.

242
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,599
WHAT?

243
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,101
COME ON. THEY RUSHED INTO THIS THING SO FAST

244
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,603
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

245
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,606
I MEAN, THEY'RE GOING TO BE ENGAGED FOR, LIKE, WHAT, A YEAR?

246
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,607
AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY

247
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,609
ONE OF THEM IS GOING TO REALIZE WHAT THEY'VE DONE

248
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,110
AND THEY'RE GOING TO CALL THE WHOLE THING OFF.

249
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,613
I'M TELLING YOU, YOU'RE GOING TO BE DANCING AT MY WEDDING

250
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,114
BEFORE YOU'RE DANCING AT THEIRS.

251
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,116
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T DANCE AT WEDDINGS.

252
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,618
WHY NOT?

253
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,120
BECAUSE WEDDINGS ARE A GREAT PLACE TO MEET WOMEN

254
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,623
AND WHEN I DANCE, I LOOK LIKE THIS:

255
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,133
HEY, MAN.

256
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,635
HEY.

00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,639
SO, WHAT'RE YOU GUYS DOING FOUR WEEKS FROM TODAY?

258
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,139
NOTHING.

259
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,140
NOTHING.

260
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,642

261
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,645

262
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,649
GREAT, BECAUSE EMILY AND I ARE GETTING MARRIED IN A MONTH.

263
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,151

273
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,665
THAT HER PARENTS GOT MARRIED

274
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,667
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE TORN DOWN, SO...

275
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,669

00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,443
YEAH.

387
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:44,944
OKAY.

388
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,951
THAT WAS A TERRIBLE THROW!

389
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,954
WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO THROW IT RIGHT TO YOU.

390
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,455
THAT'S NOT REAL.

391
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,456
LOOK AT ME.

392
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,458
MY BIG CONCERN IS WHAT'S REAL?

393
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,963
OH, MY GOD.

394
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,966
WE'RE REALLY SAD, AREN'T WE?

395
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,971
YEAH, I THINK WE ARE.

396
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,974
THIS ISN'T EVEN MY DRESS.

397
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,977
YEAH, WELL, AT LEAST YOU DIDN'T RENT YOURS

398
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,479
FROM A STORE CALLED "IT'S NOT TOO LATE."

399
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,486
I'M CHANGING OUT OF THIS.

400
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,488
ME, TOO.

401
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,991
IN, LIKE, A HALF AN HOUR?

402
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:32,992
ME, TOO.

403
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,493
OKAY. ALL RIGHT, NOW

404
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,995
THROW IT STRAIGHT THIS TIME.

405
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,496
OKAY. OKAY.

406
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,498
I'M GETTING MARRIED NEXT!

407
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,000
YAY!

408
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:49,008
I HATE MY REGULAR CLOTHES NOW, YOU KNOW?

409
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,010
IT'S LIKE I LOOK DOWN AND AND I KNOW

410
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,512
THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE THE MOST SPECIAL DAY

411
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,513
OF MY LIFE.

412
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,516
YEAH, I MEAN, IT WAS KIND OF FUN FOR A WHILE

413
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,019
BUT DIDN'T YOU START FEELING KIND OF SILLY?

414
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,020
I GUESS.

415
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,521
YEAH.

416
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,525
OH, MY GOD!

417
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,526
OH!

418
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,029
YOU'RE SUCH A CHEATER!

419
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,530
HELLO, LITTLE ONES.

420
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,531
HEY... HEY...

421
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,533
SO IS JOEY GOING TO STOP SNORING?

422
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,536
YEP, AND A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AGREED TO GO OUT WITH ME.

423
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,039
JOEY WANTED TO ASK HER OUT

424
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,541
BUT, UH, YOU KNOW, SHE PICKED ME.

425
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,043
OH, HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

426
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,546
BECAUSE I'M COOLER.

427
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,548
NO, SERIOUSLY.

428
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,053
WELL, SHE'S, YOU KNOW, SHE'S THE KIND OF GIRL...

429
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,554
JOEY WAS UNCONSCIOUS.

430
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,060
HEY, YOU GUYS, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

431
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,062
OH, MY GOD.

432
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,063
WHAT IS THAT?

433
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,066
OH... THEY GAVE IT TO ME AT THE SLEEP CLINIC

434
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,069
AND IT'S GOING TO HELP ME NOT TO SNORE.

435
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,072
WELL, ARE YOU ASLEEP RIGHT NOW, JOE?

436
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,575
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO WEAR IT UNLESS YOU ARE.

437
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,078
I KNOW I DON'T HAVE TO.

438
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,080
IT TASTES GOOD.

439
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,084
PLUS, YOU LOOK COOL.

440
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,593
I HOPE I DIDN'T STRETCH OUT EMILY'S DRESS TOO MUCH.

441
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,596
NO, YOUR BUTT'S NOT THAT MUCH BIGGER THAN HERS.

442
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,600
WELL, I JUST CALLED JOSHUA.

443
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,102
OH, HOW'D IT GO?

444
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,603
WELL, I DID MY BEST TO CONVINCE HIM

445
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,105
THAT I'M NOT SOME CRAZY GIRL

446
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,107
WHO IS DYING TO GET MARRIED--

447
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,609
THAT I'M JUST GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME.

448
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,610
WHAT'D HE SAY?

449
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,612
WELL, UH, HIS ANSWERING MACHINE

450
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,613
WAS VERY UNDERSTANDING.

451
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,617

452
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,619
I FEEL BLUE.

453
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,122
AW, SWEETIE, OH...

454
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,623
HONEY, I'LL BET YOU ANYTHING

455
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,125
HE'S GOING TO CALL YOU AGAIN.

456
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:51,130
YEAH, MAYBE, BUT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK I EVEN CARE.

457
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,134
I DON'T THINK... HE'S THE ONE I'M SAD ABOUT.

458
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,136
YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT I SAID

459
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,638
I AM TOTALLY OKAY WITH ROSS GETTING MARRIED

460
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,640
BUT AS IT TURNS OUT

461
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,643
I DON'T THINK I AM HANDLING IT ALL THAT WELL.

462
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,145
YEAH, MAYBE.

463
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:10,149
AN AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY.

464
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,650
ANY LUCK?

465
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,152
WELL, YEAH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, HOW ROSS AND I

466
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,154
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ON AGAIN, OFF AGAIN

467
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,656
ON AGAIN, OFF AGAIN.

468
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:21,660
I GUESS I JUST FIGURED THAT SOMEWHERE DOWN THE ROAD...

469
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,663
WE WOULD BE ON AGAIN... AGAIN.

470
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,665
YOU KNOW WHAT?

471
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,167
I THINK WE ALL DID.

472
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,168
YEAH.

473
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,669
HEY.

474
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,670
HEY. HEY.

475
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,179
SO, GOT US RESERVATIONS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT, OKAY?

476
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,181
HOW ABOUT ERNIE'S AT 9:00?

477
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,684
YEAH, WELL, YOU, UH, BETTER MAKE IT FOR THREE.

478
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,186
OH, SEE, I I DON'T KNOW

479
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,688
IF WE'RE GOING TO BE HUNGRY AT 3:00.

480
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,692
THREE PEOPLE.

481
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,195
JOSHUA'S NOT GOING TO BE THERE.

482
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,696
WHAT HAPPENED?

483
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,199
UM, WELL, I THINK- - I THINK HE BROKE UP WITH ME.

484
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,701
NO. WHY?

485
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,705
WELL... APPARENTLY, HE SCARES EASY.

486
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,208
OH, RACHEL, I'M SORRY.

487
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,210
WELL... THAT'S OKAY.

488
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,713
SOMETIMES... THINGS DON'T WORK OUT

489
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,217
THE WAY YOU THOUGHT THEY WOULD.

490
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,219
COME HERE.

491
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,720
OH...

492
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,223

493
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,727
WELL, HEY, DON'T YOU HAVE

494
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,229
TO GO PICK UP EMILY?

495
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,730
YEAH.

496
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,731
YEAH.

497
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,732
ARE YOU OKAY?

498
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,234
YEAH.

499
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,735
I GOT MY GIRLS.

500
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,740
OKAY.

501
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,248
UGH.

502
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,249

503
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,750
OH...

504
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,758
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT CHEER YOU UP?

505
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,759
WHAT?

506
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,265
YOU KNOW, I GOT TO TELL YOU

507
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,767
THIS REALLY DOES PUT ME IN A BETTER MOOD.

508
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,269
MM HMM.

509
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,271
OH. I WISH THERE WAS A JOB

510
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,774
WHERE I COULD WEAR THIS ALL THE TIME.

511
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,277
MAYBE SOMEDAY THERE WILL BE.

512
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,778

513
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,280
OH, GOD, THAT'S CHANDLER.

514
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,281
HE WAS GOING TO COME BY

515
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,783
AND BORROW SOME CANDLES FOR HIS BIG DATE.

516
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,784
OH, OKAY.

517
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,786
RACHEL, DON'T GET  IT; HE'LL SEE US.

518
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,288
THE GROOM CANNOT SEE THE BRIDE.

519
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,290
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MARRY CHANDLER.

520
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,792
NOT AFTER THIS.

521
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,296
OKAY, GUYS... JUST RELAX.

522
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,802
IDO...

523
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,808
I GOT TO GO.

524
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,310
OH, NO, JOSHUA...

525
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,311
JOSHUA...

526
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,812
OH...

527
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,816
YEAH, WELL, THAT OUGHT TO DO IT.

528
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,822
FOOD'S HERE.

529
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,824
FAIR ENOUGH.

530
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,827
15 MINUTE WARNING!

531
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,829
LATER...

532
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,335

533
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,337

534
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:29,848
DUDE, I AM TRYING TO SLEEP.
