1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,005
HEY.

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,007
HEY, CHECK IT OUT. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,508
JOEY HAS BEEN HOLDING HIS BREATH

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,010
FOR ALMOST FOUR MINUTES.

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,517
DUDE, ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?

6
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,019
PHEEBS

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,520
I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,521
UH HUH. WHAT?

9
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,023
WELL, SINCE I'M MOVING OUT

10
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,025
AN AND YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL...

11
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,026
OH... HOW ABOUT

12
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,527
I MOVE IN WITH YOU?

13
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,029
WELL, THAT WOULD BE GREAT

14
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,031
BUT THEN WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT DENISE?

15
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,033
WHO'S DENISE?

16
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,034
MY ROOMMATE.

17
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,035
DO YOU HAVE A ROOMMATE?

18
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,537
YES, DENISE. DENISE.

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,041
WHAT IS WITH THE SECRECY, PHOEBE, HUH?

20
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,542
AND WHAT ABOUT THIS DENISE?

21
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,044
IS SHE CUTE?

22
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,545
PHEEBS, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

23
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,547
HOW CAN YOU HAVE A ROOMMATE THAT NONE OF US KNOW ABOUT?

24
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,050
MAYBE BECAUSE YOU NEVER LISTEN TO ANYTHING THAT I SAY.

25
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,551
I TALK ABOUT HER ALL THE TIME.

26
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,552
DENISE!

27
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,554
 HEY, RACH, LISTEN...

28
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,556
I WAS THINKING, UH, I'M GOING TO HAVE

29
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,058
AN EXTRA ROOM OVER AT MY PLACE.

30
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,059
OH, THAT'S TRUE.

31
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,061
YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU MOVE IN WITH ME?

32
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,062
IT'LL BE GREAT-- WE CAN, LIKE,

33
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,064
STAY UP LATE TALKING, AND WATCH MOVIES...

34
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,566
AND YOU KNOW ABOUT NAKED THURSDAYS, RIGHT?

35
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,571
YEAH, YEAH, I THINK I'M GOING TO FIND MY OWN PLACE.

36
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,073
HEY, HEY!

37
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,575
I THOUGHT NAKED THURSDAYS WAS JUST OUR THING, MAN.

46
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,116
HEY.

47
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,117
HI.

48
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,618
SO WHAT DID RACHEL SAY

49
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,620
WHEN YOU TOLD HER YOU WERE STILL MARRIED TO HER?

50
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,122
OH, THAT. UM...

51
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,124
SHE TOOK IT REALLY WELL.

52
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,625
OH. YOU DIDN'T TELL HER, DID YOU?

53
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,127
NO.

54
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,629
OF COURSE NOT, BECAUSE YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HER.

55
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,630
I AM NOT IN LOVE WITH HER.

56
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,132
SHE WAS VERY UPSET

57
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,134
ABOUT HAVING TO MOVE OUT SO I I DIDN'T TELL HER

58
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,635
WE WERE STILL MARRIED

59
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,137
BECAUSE SHE'D ONLY GET MORE UPSET.

60
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,638
I I I JUST, I COMFORTED HER

61
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,639
AS A FRIEND.

62
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,141
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, COMFORTED HER?

63
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,143
IT WAS NOTHING, JUST GAVE HER A HUG.

64
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,146
UH HUH! A CLASSIC SIGN OF LOVE, THE HUG.

65
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,648
IT'S ALSO A SIGN OF FRIENDSHIP.

66
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,151
YEAH, NOT IN YOUR CASE, LOVEY LOVERSON.

67
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,653
IT WAS A HUG, OKAY?

68
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,155
A SIMPLE HUG.

69
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,658
I WAS A FRIEND BEING A FRIEND

70
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,160
TO A FRIEND.

71
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,662
USE THE WORD "FRIEND" MORE.

72
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,663
JUST TELL ME THIS--

73
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,665
DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT SMELL HER HAIR?

74
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,667
S SM SMELL HER HAIR?

75
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,170
WELL, WHAT IF I DID?

76
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,673
90% OF A WOMAN'S PHEROMONES COME OUT THE TOP OF HER HEAD.

77
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,676
THAT'S WHY... THAT'S WHY WOMEN ARE SHORTER.

78
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,180
SO THAT MEN WILL FALL IN LOVE WHEN THEY HUG THEM.

79
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,682
COME ON, ROSS, YOU'RE A SCIENTIST.

80
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,186
I WAS HUGGING HER AS A FRIEND, OKAY.

81
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,688
IT'S NOT MY FAULT HER... HER HAIR GOT IN MY FACE.

82
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,190
SHE'S GOT A LOT OF IT

83
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,192
AND IT SMELLS ALL, ALL, UH...

84
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,693

85
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,195
COCONUTTY.

86
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,198
WHAT? OH...

87
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,700
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE FEELINGS FOR RACHEL.

88
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,203
MAYBE IT MEANS I HAVE FEELINGS FOR COCONUTS.

89
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,204
OKAY. WHATEVER YOU SAY

90
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,206
BUT JUST BE CAREFUL, ALL RIGHT?

91
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,208
RACHEL'S NOT IN THE SAME PLACE YOU ARE.

92
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,210
OKAY, IF THE PLACE YOU'RE REFERRING TO

93
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,711
IS BEING IN LOVE

94
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,214
THEN SHE IS IN THE SAME PLACE AS ME

95
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,217
BECAUSE I AM NOT IN THAT PLACE.

96
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,219
OKAY, I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT

97
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,720
BUT, YOU KNOW

98
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,722
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE YOU WERE SPEAKING

99
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,724
THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF LOVE.

100
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,230
HEY. HI.

101
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,731
DUDE, SOME GUY JUST CALLED FOR YOU.

102
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,732
WHO WAS IT?

103
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,234
I DON'T KNOW.

104
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,736
HOW ABOUT, "THANKS FOR TAKING THE MESSAGE"? GEEZ.

105
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,738
HEY, LISTEN, YOU KNOW

106
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,740
WHEN YOU MOVE IN, RACHEL'S ROOM'S

107
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,741
GOING TO BE EMPTY.

108
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,742
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT

109
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,244
WHAT WE WANT TO DO WITH IT?

110
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,245
SURE.

111
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,247
OKAY. I WAS THINKING WE SHOULD HAVE

112
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,748
A BEAUTIFUL GUEST ROOM, RIGHT?

113
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,749
WITH A MAHOGANY SLEIGH BED

114
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,252
AND BEDSIDE TABLES WITH FLOWERS ON IT ALL THE TIME.

115
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,253
AND THEN WE CAN HAVE

116
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,255
A ROLL TOP DESK WITH LITTLE COMMENT CARDS

117
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,756
SO PEOPLE CAN TELL US HOW MUCH

118
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,258
THEY LOVED STAYING HERE.

119
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,259
OR WHATEVER, YOU KNOW.

120
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,760
I REALLY HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT MUCH.

121
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,764
WELL, I LIKE THAT IDEA... OBVIOUSLY.

122
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,767
BUT I WAS THINKING MAYBE... MAYBE... MAYBE IT COULD BE

123
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,269
A GAME ROOM, YOU KNOW?

124
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,271
I MEAN, YOU CAN BUY OLD ARCADE GAMES

125
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,274
LIKE, UH, LIKE SPACE INVADERS AND ASTEROIDS FOR $200 DOLLARS.

126
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,776
THE REAL ONES, THE BIG, BIG, BIG ONES.

127
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,279
NO.

128
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,780
OKAY, SO YOU MEAN "NO"

129
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,284
AS IN, "GEE, CHANDLER, WHAT AN INTERESTING IDEA.

130
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,288
LET'S DISCUSS IT BEFORE WE REJECT IT COMPLETELY."

131
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,290
OH, I'M SORRY. OF COURSE.

132
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,293
YES, INTERESTING IDEA.

133
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,295
TALK ABOUT IT, BUT... NO.

134
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,797
SO THAT'S IT?

135
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,300
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, ARCADE GAMES

136
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,801
GO IN THE BEAUTIFUL GUEST ROOM.

137
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,802
THE BEAUTIFUL GUEST ROOM'S

138
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,304
GOING TO BE FILLED WITH ANTIQUES.

139
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,306
WHICH IS WHY ASTEROIDS IS PERFECT.

140
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,308
IT'S THE OLDEST GAME.

141
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,811
WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST THE BEAUTIFUL GUEST ROOM?

142
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,814
NOTHING. I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST THE BEAUTIFUL GUEST ROOM

143
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,816
ESPECIALLY SINCE EVERYBODY THAT WE KNOW

144
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,318
LIVES ABOUT 30 SECONDS AWAY.

145
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,820
ARE YOU MOCKING ME?

146
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,821
NO, I'M NOT MOCKING YOU

147
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,323
OR YOUR "BEAUTIFUL GUEST ROOM."

148
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,829
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

149
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,832
OH, NOTHING. MONICA AND I HAD A STUPID FIGHT.

150
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,834
BUT YOU'RE STILL MOVING IN TOGETHER, RIGHT?

151
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,336
BECAUSE MY AD CAME OUT TODAY.

152
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,840
"WANTED, FEMALE ROOMMATE: NONSMOKER, NON UGLY."

153
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,843
NICE.

154
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,844
YEAH?

155
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,846
I JUST FIGURED, AFTER LIVING WITH YOU

156
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,848
IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING CHANGE OF PACE

157
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,849
TO HAVE A FEMALE ROOMMATE.

158
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,851
YOU KNOW? SOMEONE I COULD LEARN FROM.

159
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,853
SOMEONE... SOMEONE WHO'S DIFFERENT THAN ME

160
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,357
AND WHAT'S MORE DIFFERENT THAN ME-- A GUY WHO'S NOT 19--

161
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,360
THAN, SAY, A GIRL WHO IS 19?

162
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,861
HUH?

163
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,364
NOT JUST A HAT RACK, MY FRIEND.

164
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,368
PHEEBS, I HAVE TO ASK YOU...

165
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,870
SHH! I'M SWAMPED RIGHT NOW.

166
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,373
YOU'RE JUST STARING INTO SPACE.

167
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,376
UM, I'M TRYING TO MOVE THAT PENCIL.

168
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,378
THIS ONE?

169
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,880
IT WORKED!

170
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,883
PHEEBS, THIS WHO LE APARTMENT THING

171
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,385
IS A NIGHTMARE.

172
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,886
EVERY PLACE THAT I CAN AFFORD

173
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,388
COMES WITH A ROOMMATE WHO IS A FREAK.

174
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,889
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS.

175
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:35,395
"WANTED, FEMALE ROOMMATE: NONSMOKER, NON UGLY."

176
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,899
THAT'S PROBABLY JUST SOME 12 YEAR OLD KID

177
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,401
TRYING TO GET GIRLS TO CALL.

178
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,404
I MEAN, IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S NOTHING.

179
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,405
THIS CITY IS FULL.

180
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,906
WAIT, NO, LOOK AT THIS.

181
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,910
"TWO BEDROOM, TWO BATH, MUST BE NONSMOKER.

182
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,412
SATAN WORSHIPERS OKAY."

183
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,915
OH, YEAH, BUT IT'S ON THE GROUND FLOOR.

184
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,418
HEY.

185
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,919
HEY.

186
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,921
RACH, UH, YOU STILL LOOKING FOR A PLACE?

187
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,922
YEAH. WHY?

188
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,425
OKAY, THERE'S THIS GUY, WARREN, FROM THE MUSEUM

189
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,427
AND HE'S GOING ON A DIG FOR, LIKE, TWO YEARS

190
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,429
AND HE'S GOT THIS GREAT PLACE

191
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,931
HE NEEDS TO SUBLET, SO, UH... YOU INTERESTED?

192
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:12,932
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

193
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,934
I'D LOVE TO LIVE AT WARREN'S.

194
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,436
I LOVE WARREN. OH, WAIT, WAIT.

195
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,439
IS HE THE GUY THAT ASKED YOU FOR NAKED PICTURES OF ME?

196
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,441
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

197
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,942
HE WON'T BE THERE!

198
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:23,943
THANK YOU.

199
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,944
OH, DON'T THANK ME.

200
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,447
YOU WANT TO THANK SOMEONE, THANK THE VOLCANO

201
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,949
THAT ERUPTED THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO

202
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,451
KILLING, BUT PERFECTLY PRESERVING

203
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,952
AN ENTIRE CIVILIZATION.

204
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,456
HERE'S WARREN'S NUMBER.

205
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,957
OH, THIS IS GREAT.

206
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,460
I AM GOING TO CALL HIM RIGHT NOW!

207
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,462
THANK YOU.

208
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,964
OKAY.

209
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,966
YOU GO CALL HIM.

210
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,469
I SAW IT.

211
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,473
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

212
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,474
UM, I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT

213
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,476
WHICH YOU ALREADY KNOW BUT WON'T ADMIT.

214
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,977
YOU KNOW, THAT YOU LOVE HER AGAIN.

215
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:58,978
YOU RE LOVE HER.

216
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,981
LOOK, I DO NOT RE LOVE HER.

217
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,984
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WON'T JUST ADMIT IT.

218
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,988
OKAY, JUST PROMISE ME THAT YOU WON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID.

219
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,990
LOOK, WE'RE JUST FRIENDS NOW, OKAY?

220
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,992
WHY WOULD I DO ANYTHING STUPID?

221
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,993

222
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,995
WELL, THE APARTMENT IS ALREADY SUBLETTED.

223
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,497
I MEAN, THIS IS JUST HOPELESS.

224
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,998
I'M NEVER GOING TO FIND ANYTHING.

225
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,000
YOU CAN LIVE WITH ME.

226
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,001
WHAT?

227
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:22,502
WHAT?

228
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,005
WHAT?

229
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,507
OH, MY GOD

230
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,008
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

231
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,011
I WOULD LOVE TO LIVE WITH YOU, ROSS.

232
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,513
TH THAT'S GREAT. THANK YOU.

233
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,015
I I'M JUST GLAD I COULD, YOU KNOW, HELP YOU OUT.

234
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,520
WOW, I'M... I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS.

235
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,522
THIS IS SO, SO NOT STUPID.

236
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,027
ROSS, ROSS, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS MEANS TO ME.

237
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,029
I MEAN... I MEAN, I WAS GOING TO BE HOMELESS.

238
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,030
YOU'VE JUST SAVED ME.

239
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,532
YOU'RE MY HERO.

240
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,534
HERO. I, I DON'T KNOW.

241
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,035
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

242
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,539
OH, I HAVE TO GO TELL MONICA

243
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,541
WHAT A WONDERFUL BROTHER SHE HAS.

244
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,543
OH, PLEASE...

245
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,553
YOU'RE GOING TO SAY THINGS NOW, AREN'T YOU?

246
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,555
NO. NO, I WON'T

247
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,558
BUT I SHOULD TELL YOU THIS:

248
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,561
THIS EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED TO MY ROOMMATE DENISE.

249
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,063
SHE MOVED IN WITH A GUY WHO WAS SECRETLY MARRIED TO HER

250
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,566
AND HE SAID HE DIDN'T LOVE HER, BUT HE REALLY DID

251
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,067
AND IT JUST BLEW UP

252
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,070
AND THAT'S HOW SHE ENDED UP LIVING WITH ME.

253
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,575
OKAY, THAT'S A LIE.

254
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,578
YOU DON'T HAVE A ROOMMATE.

255
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,079
DENISE!

256
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,584
NO ONE EVER LISTENS TO ME!

257
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,090
HI.

258
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,592
HI.

259
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,093
HI. LISTEN, I'M SORRY ABOUT BEFORE.

260
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,095
I DON'T NEED TO HAVE A GAME ROOM.

261
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,598
I MEAN, WHEN I WAS A KID I ONLY PLAYED THOSE GAMES

262
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,599
BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET GIRLS.

263
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,100
NOW I CAN GET THEM.

264
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,102
NOW I HAVE YOU.

265
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,606
NO,-N NOT THAT I THINK I HAVE YOU...

266
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,109
OR THINK OF YOU AS PROPERTY IN ANY SORT OF WAY.

267
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,110
I SEE WOMEN...

268
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,111
STOP IT, CHANDLER.

269
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,615
I'M SORRY, TOO.

270
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,116
REALLY?

271
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,118
YEAH. OH, YES...

272
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,620
LISTEN, WE DON'T HAVE

273
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,621
TO MAKE THAT A GUEST ROOM.

274
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,122
WE CAN THINK OF SOMETHING

275
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,123
TO DO WITH THE ROOM TOGETHER.

276
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,625
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

277
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,126
WE CAN EASILY THINK OF A WAY

278
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,628
FOR US BOTH TO ENJOY THE ROOM.

279
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,129
TOTALLY.

280
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,134
WE DON'T HAVE

281
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,135
TO COME UP WITH THIS NOW.

282
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,137
OH, GOOD.

283
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,139
HEY, KNOW WHAT? WHY DON'T WE THINK ABOUT CHANGES

284
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,140
WE CAN MAKE IN THE LIVING ROOM.

285
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,642
CHANGES?

286
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,644
YEAH, I MEAN, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

287
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,145
TO MOVE AROUND SOME FURNITURE

288
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,647
TO MAKE ROOM FOR MY CHAIR.

289
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,151
Y Y YOU'RE GOING TO BRING THE BARCALOUNGER OVER HERE?

290
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,153
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

291
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,655
WELL... IT'S JUST THAT THEY'RE A SET

292
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,657
AND THEY SHOULD PROBABLY STAY TOGETHER.

293
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,158
OH, THAT'S COOL.

294
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,160
THEN I'LL JUST, UH, BRING THEM BOTH OVER.

295
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,665
SEE, NOW, NOW, YOU'RE TAKING THEM AWAY FROM THEIR HOME.

296
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:06,666
OKAY. I GET IT.

297
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:07,667
SO I GET NOTHING.

298
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:08,668
NOTHING HERE IS MINE.

299
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,169
EVERYTHING IS YOURS.

300
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,170
I'LL GET UP IN THE MORNING

301
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,673
PUT ON YOUR CLOTHES, AND HEAD OFF TO WORK.

302
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,674
YEAH, YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

303
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,676
YEAH, THAT'S IT-- EVERYTHING WILL BE MINE.

304
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,677
NOTHING WILL BE YOURS.

305
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,178
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

306
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,180
OH, COME ON, CHANDLER, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BARCALOUNGER!

307
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,181
IT JUST... IT DOESN'T MATCH.

308
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,182
WHERE IS IT GOING TO GO?

309
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,184
IN THE GAME ROOM!

310
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,686
IT IS NOT MY FAULT

311
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,688
THAT YOUR CHAIRS ARE INCREDIBLY UGLY.

312
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,189
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S FINE. THAT'S FINE.

313
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,691
I WON'T BRING OVER THE CHAIRS.

314
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,692
I WON'T BRING ANYTHING OVER.

315
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,694
I WOULDN'T WANT TO RUIN THE AMBIANCE

316
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,696
OVER HERE AT GRANDMA'S PLACE!

317
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,699
EVERYTHING ON YOUR APPLICATION

318
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,200
LOOKS REALLY GOOD. UH...

319
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,702
OH, JUST ONE LAST QUESTION. UH...

320
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,704
ARE YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS GOING TO BE OVER HERE

321
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,706
ALL THE TIME, LIKE, PARTYING AND HANGING OUT?

322
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,708
OH, DON'T WORRY, I'M NOT REALLY A PARTY GIRL.

323
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,210
WHOA. NOW, LOOK.

324
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,212
DON'T JUST BE BLURTING STUFF OUT.

325
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,716
I WANT YOU TO REALLY THINK ABOUT YOUR ANSWERS.

326
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,717

327
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,720
YOU CAN CALL OFF THE ROOMMATE SEARCH.

328
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,722
HI. I'LL BE LIVING HERE.

329
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,223
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

330
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,726
HE'S JUST SOME GUY WHO REALLY WANTS THE APARTMENT

331
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,728
BUT I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO GET IT.

332
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,230
WHY DID YOU TAKE THE SHOWER CURTAIN DOWN?

333
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,232
THAT THING WAS A HAZARD.

334
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,235
I'M VERY SAFETY CONSCIOUS.

335
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,745
HEY.

336
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,746
HEY.

337
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,248
OH, I WAS JUST CLEARING SOME SPACE FOR YOUR STUFF.

338
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,249
OH, THANKS.

339
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,251
BUT, LISTEN, I WAS JUST AT MONICA'S

340
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,253
AND SHE AND CHANDLER HAD A BIG FIGHT

341
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,755
AND THEY'RE NOT MOVING IN.

342
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,757
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THEY'RE NOT MOVING IN?

343
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,259
THEY'RE THEY'RE STILL MOVING IN, RIGHT?

344
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,261
NO, NO. THEY JUST HAD A BIG BLOWOUT

345
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,263
OVER WHAT TO DO WITH MY ROOM.

346
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,266
WHAT? OVER A STUPID ROOM?

347
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,768
I KNOW. I FEEL KIND OF BAD FOR THEM

348
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,269
BUT I'M ALSO REALLY PSYCHED

349
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,771
BECAUSE NOW I DON'T HAVE TO MOVE IN HERE.

350
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,272
OH. NO NO, YEAH.

351
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,774
NO, THAT PART'S GREAT.

352
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,278
WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT YOU GUYS FIGHTING?

353
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,282
IS THIS REALLY OVER A ROOM?

354
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,785
I MEAN, THAT IS SO SILLY.

355
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,788
ROSS, WE CAN HANDLE THIS.

356
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,790
WELL, UH, APPARENTLY NOT

357
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,293
AND I CAN'T JUST STAND BY AND WATCH TWO PEOPLE

358
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:19,298
I CARE ABOUT SO MUCH BE HURT BY SOMETHING THAT IS SO SILLY.

359
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,300
I MEAN

360
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,302
ENOUGH OF THE SILLINESS.

361
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,804
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU

362
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,305
TELL HER TO STOP BEING SILLY?

363
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,807

364
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,809
ALL RIGHT, OKAY, OKAY.

365
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,813
TWO VERY GOOD POINTS.

366
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,318
LOOK... I'VE KNOWN YOU BOTH A LONG TIME

367
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,321
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN EITHER OF YOU ONE MILLIONTH

368
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,324
AS HAPPY AS YOU'VE BEEN SINCE YOU GOT TOGETHER.

369
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,326
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO THROW

370
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,329
THAT ALL AWAY OVER A ROOM?

371
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,832
THAT IS SO SILLY.

372
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,334
I MEAN, WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT--

373
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,337
LOVE... OR SILLINESS?

374
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,842
WELL, WE ARE FOND OF THE SILLINESS

375
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,344
BUT WE ALSO HAVE A SOFT SPOT FOR THE LOVE.

376
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,848
LOVE IS THE BEST MEDICINE. THAT'S LAUGHTER.

377
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,850
WHY DO YOU DO IT? I DON'T KNOW.

378
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,852
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

379
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:19,859
NOW, CHANDLER, YOU WANT TO LIVE WITH MONICA, RIGHT?

380
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,361
YEAH, I DO.

381
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,864
AND, MON, YOU WANT TO LIVE WITH CHANDLER, DON'T YOU?

382
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,365
YES.

383
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,367
GOOD. A VERBAL CONTRACT IS BINDING

384
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,869
IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

385
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,882
SO, I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A PLACE.

386
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,385
NO, NO, I'M STAYING PUT.

387
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,888
OH.

388
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,391
I WAS GOING TO OFFER YOU MY APARTMENT.

389
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,394
WHY? WHERE YOU GOING?

390
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,897
I DON'T KNOW.

391
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,900
HEY... RACH.

392
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,401
HI.

393
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,403
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BELIEVE IT.

394
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,906
MONICA AND CHANDLER ARE MOVING IN AGAIN.

395
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,407
IT'S GREAT NEWS, RIGHT?

396
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,909
I MEAN, FOR THEM, RIGHT?

397
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,911
OH, WOW.

398
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,912
YEAH, BUT, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE

399
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,413
WE GET TO BE ROOMMATES AGAIN.

400
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,415
YE... YEAH.

401
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,419
YOU KNOW, ABOUT THAT, UM...

402
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,922
ROSS, I... I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER

403
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,924
TO LET ME MOVE IN AND EVERYTHING, BUT...

404
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,426
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE WEIRD?

405
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,428
WH... WHY?

406
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:33,432
WHY WHY WOULD IT-- WHY WOULD IT BE WEIRD?

407
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,435
WELL, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE OF US--

408
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,437
BECAUSE OF OUR HISTORY.

409
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,939
NO!

410
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,440
NO?

411
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,942
NO! NO!

412
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,443
IT WOULD ONLY BE WEIRD

413
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,946
IF WE WERE STILL IN THAT PLACE.

414
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,449
I MEAN, ARE YOU STILL IN THAT PLACE?

415
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,450
NO, NOT AT ALL.

416
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,952
GOOD. ME NEITHER.

417
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,954
SO IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

418
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,956
WE'RE JUST TWO FRIENDS

419
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,958
WHO HAPPEN TO BE ROOMMATES.

420
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,459
OKAY, BUT, ROSS

421
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,461
EVENTUALLY YOU AND I ARE GOING TO BE DATING.

422
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,466
REALLY. WE ARE.

423
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,468
WELL, YEAH. I'M GOING TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND

424
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,470
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

425
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,973
OHH.

426
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:14,974
THAT'D BE GREAT.

427
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,475
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

428
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,477
IF YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY

429
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,979
WE'LL JUST WORK OUT A SYSTEM.

430
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,981
YOU KNOW, IT'LL BE LIKE IN COLLEGE.

431
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,983
I'LL HANG A HANGER ON THE DOOR AND PUT A SIGN:

432
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,484
"COME BACK LATER.

433
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,486
I'M GETTING LUCKY."

434
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,990

435
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,493
YEAH, I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT.

436
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:40,499
SO ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS WHOLE MOVING IN THING?

437
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,502
I MEAN, IT'S A REALLY BIG STEP.

438
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,004
AND WHAT'S THE RUSH?

439
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,508

440
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,510
THAT'S VERY FUNNY.

441
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,012
HE'S BEING SILLY BECAUSE HE KNOWS

442
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,513
THAT WE ENJOY THE SILLINESS.

443
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,017
NO, I'M I'M SERIOUS, OKAY?

444
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,518
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.

445
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,020
YOU MOVE IN

446
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,023
UH, YOU START FIGHTING OVER STUPID GAME ROOMS.

447
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,025
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU BREAK UP.

448
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,526
ROSS, YOU WERE RIGHT BEFORE.

449
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,528
IT WAS JUST A STUPID FIGHT ABOUT A ROOM.

450
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,030
LOOK, THERE ARE NO STUPID FIGHTS.

451
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,034
THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE ROOM.

452
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,537
THIS IS ABOUT WHAT THE ROOM REPRESENTS.

453
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:23,042
AND, UNFORTUNATELY, THIS ROOM COULD DESTROY YOU.

454
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,044
YEAH, I'M NOT SO WORRIED.

455
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,545
YEAH. NO, ME NEITHER.

456
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,547
FINE. IT'S YOUR LIFE.

457
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,052
I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU GUYS BREAK UP, YOU KNOW?

458
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,055
WHICH YOU WILL DO IF YOU MOVE IN TOGETHER.

459
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,560
BUT IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

460
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,561
DON'T DO IT!

461
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,069
YOU STILL WANT TO MOVE IN TOGETHER, RIGHT?

462
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,070
OF COURSE.

463
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,571
ROSS DIDN'T SCARE YOU?

464
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,574
SCARED ME OUT OF EVER WANTING TO LIVE WITH HIM.

465
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,077
HEY, COME HERE. I GOT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

466
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,078
OKAY.

467
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,082
OH, MY GOD.

468
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,085
SOMEONE'S KILLED SQUARE MAN.

469
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,088
THIS IS WHERE I THOUGHT THE BARCALOUNGER COULD GO.

470
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,589
YOU SEE, YOU CAN SEE THE TV

471
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,092
AND STILL, IT'S WALKING DISTANCE TO THE KITCHEN.

472
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,094
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.

473
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,096
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING, TOO. OKAY.

474
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,598
YOU KNOW THOSE BIG, BIG ROAD SIGNS

475
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,100
THAT SAY "MERGE"?

476
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,101
MM HMM.

477
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,102
YOU KNOW?

478
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,603
SO I WAS THINKING THAT WE COULD GET

479
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,605
ONE OF THOSE SIGNS AND HANG IT OVER OUR BED...

480
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,110
BECAUSE THAT'S YOU AND I TOGETHER.

481
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,611
"MERGE."

482
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,114
OH, MY GOD, I LOVE THAT.

483
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,115
REALLY?

484
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,616
UH, NO.

485
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,123
?
?? I FOUND YOU IN MY BED ?

486
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,126
??
?? HOW'D YOU WIND UP THERE?

487
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,629
?? YOU ARE A MYSTERY ??

488
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,132
?
?? LITTLE BLACK CURLY HAIR ?

489
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,135
?? LITTLE BLACK CURLY HAIR ? ?

490
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,138
?? LITTLE BLACK, LITTLE BLACK, LITTLE BLACK, LITTLE BLACK ??

491
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:04,143
??
?? LITTLE BLACK CURLY HAIR.

492
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,144

493
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,645
THANK YOU.

494
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,648
NOW UM...

495
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,651
IF YOU WANT TO RECEIVE E MAILS ABOUT MY UPCOMING SHOWS

496
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,654
THEN PLEASE GIVE ME MONEY SO I CAN BUY A COMPUTER.

497
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,159
SO, UH...

498
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,160

499
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,662
WHERE ARE THE OTHER GUYS? UM, WELL, LET'S SEE.

500
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,165
MONICA AND CHANDLER ARE OCCUPIED.

501
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,167
FIGHTING? NO, THE OTHER THING.

502
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,171
I REALLY THINK IT'S GR EAT THEY WORKED THINGS OUT.

503
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,673
YEAH, THERE'S NO BREAKING THEM UP, IS THERE?

504
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,675
HEY, CAN I BORROW THE KEY TO YOUR HOUSE

505
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,178
SO I CAN RUN ACROSS THE STREET AND MAKE A COPY?

506
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,179
SURE. HERE.

507
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,680
THANK YOU.

508
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,182
NOW, ARE YOU SURE?

509
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,185
BECAUSE, ONCE I MAKE A COPY, THERE'S NO TURNING BACK.

510
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,686
YEAH, I'M SURE.

511
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,689
NOW, GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND.

512
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,191

513
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,195
UH...

514
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,197
LISTEN, ROSS... YOU REALLY THINK

515
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,200
THIS MOVING IN WITH RACHEL IS A GOOD IDEA?

516
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,702
I'VE BEEN BACK AND FORTH.

517
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,705
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO BACK, OKAY?

518
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,707
RACHEL MOVES IN AND, BEFORE YOU KNOW IT

519
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,709
YOU'RE RIGHT WHERE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE--

520
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,710
BACK TOGETHER.

521
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,212
YEAH, I DON'T THINK SO.

522
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,214
SHE'S ALREADY TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW

523
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,215
DATING OTHER GUYS.

524
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,217
THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK OUT.

525
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,219
THEN SHE'S GOING TO COME HOME ALL WEEPY

526
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,721
AND YOU'LL BE TELLING HER, "OH, THAT'S OKAY.

527
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,223
YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE."

528
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,225
AND THEN BAM! SHE FINDS YOU.

529
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,229
WOW...

530
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,230
WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

531
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,732
I AM TELLING YOU, ROSS, SHE IS DEFINITELY GOING

532
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,234
TO FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU AGAIN.

533
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,735
NOW, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

534
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,737
IS THAT WHAT I WANT?

535
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,239
YES.

536
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,744
OKAY, HOLD ON. I'M GOING TO MAKE YOUR LIFE MUCH EASIER.

537
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,746
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THE PLACE WAS CLOSED.

538
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,248
I'LL JUST COPY IT LATER.

539
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,249
OR NOT.

540
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,252
RACH, WHY DON'T YOU JUST MOVE IN WITH ME?

541
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,753
 OH, WHOA

542
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,255
WHOA, JOEY.

543
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,257
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.

544
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,759
I MEAN, LOOK, RACH, I KNOW I SCARED YOU OFF

545
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,263
WITH THAT WHOLE NAKED THURSDAYS THING, BUT...

546
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,765
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

547
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,269
WELL... IT WOULD BE EASIER TO MOVE JUST RIGHT ACROSS THE HALL.

548
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,271
WAIT A MINUTE--

549
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,774
UNLESS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT NAKED WEDNESDAYS.

550
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,277
THURSDAY'S CLEARLY NOT GOOD FOR YOU.

551
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,778
PICK A DAY.

552
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,385
HI. COME ON IN. HI.

553
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,886
THANKS FOR COMING BACK.

554
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,388
UM, OKAY, THERE'VE BEE N A LOT OF PEOPLE

555
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:32,291
INTERESTED IN THE ROOM, BUT I HAVE NARROWED IT DOWN

556
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,293
AND YOU ARE ONE OF THE FINALISTS.

557
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,294
GREAT.

558
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,796
OKAY, NOW, BEFORE I MAKE MY DECISION

559
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,797
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

560
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,799
THAT OUR PERSONALITIES MATCH, OKAY?

561
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,301
SO I MADE UP A LITTLE TEST.

562
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,802
NOW, I'M GOING TO SAY A WORD

563
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,305
AND THEN YOU SAY THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MIND.

564
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,806
I CAN DO THAT.

565
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,807
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

566
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:49,808
PILLOW.

567
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,810
FIGHT.

568
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,811
VERY GOOD.

569
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,814
"G."

570
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,317
STRING? EXCELLENT.

571
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,319
OKAY

572
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,321
UM...

573
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,323
DOGGIE.

574
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,325
KITTEN?

575
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,827
OOH, SORRY.

576
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,828
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

577
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,829
NO, NO, NO.

578
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,830
SO CLOSE, THOUGH.

579
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,332
BUT, YOU KNOW, BYE BYE.
