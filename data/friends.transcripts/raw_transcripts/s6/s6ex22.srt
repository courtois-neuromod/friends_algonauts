00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,671
HI, YOU GUYS. HI.

00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,673
WHAT'S THE MATTER? WELL, IT'S JUST...

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,174
IT'S ONE OF TH ESE SITUATIONS

4
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,175
THAT I JUST HATE.

5
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,678
YOU KNOW, A MASSAGE CLIENT GAVE ME THREE TICKETS

6
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,514
TO THE HELMUT PELTZ EXHIBIT AT THE MORGAN CHASE MUSEUM.

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,517
NOW YOU'RE THINKING YOU'VE GOT TO SLEEP WITH HIM.

8
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:21,021
NO. NO, IT'S JUST THAT HE GAVE ME THREE TICKETS

9
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,522
AND THERE ARE SIX OF US.

10
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,025
I'LL GIVE UP MY TICKET. ME, TOO.

11
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,027
OKAY. THAT'S SO GENEROUS.

12
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,530
AND I THINK ROSS IS GENEROUS, TOO.

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,532
GREAT. OKAY, THEN IT'S JUST US GIRLS.

14
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,535
GREAT. GREAT.

15
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,038
SO WHAT WHAT IS THE EXHIBIT?

16
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:42,042
IT'S MOSTLY JUST PHOTOGRAPHS OF, UM, LESBIAN LOVE SCENES

17
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,045
INTERSPERSED WITH VIDEO GAMES AND FREE SANDWICHES.

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,550
OH, MAN...

19
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,554
HEY.

20
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,056
HI, THERE. HEY.

21
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,557
HEY, ROSS, LISTEN--

22
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,558
CHANDLER GOT YOU OUT OF GOING

23
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,061
TO THE LESBIAN/SANDWICH MUSEUM THIS WEEKEND.

24
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,565
THANKS, BUT I HAVE PLANS.

25
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,068
UH, ELIZABETH AND I ARE GOING OUT OF TOWN.

26
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,070
OH, THAT'S GREAT-- THINK ABOUT ALL THE MONEY

27
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,571
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE.

28
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,573
WHY? WHAT?

29
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,576
WELL, HER FATHER PAYS YOU FOR BABY SITTING, RIGHT?

30
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,080
NO. THAT'S FUNNY, BUT MAYBE IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON.

31
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,582
YOU KNOW, LET IT GO,STOP IT.

32
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,586
BESIDES, RACHEL'S GOING OUT WITH ELIZABETH'S FATHER

33
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,089
SO, UH, HE'S MUCH OLDER THAN SHE IS.

34
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:35,095
LOOKS LIKE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE INTERESTED IN FOSSILS, HUH?

35
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,097
ROSS, ALL THAT DOES IS REMIND US

36
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,099
THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN FOSSILS.

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,602
OKAY, OKAY. UH, WELL, UH

38
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:48,108
RACHEL'S GOING TO NEED TO YELL SWEET NOTHING'S IN HIS EAR, HUH?

39
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,611
ROSS...

40
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,612
OH, COME ON, YOU GUYS

41
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,115
THAT'S FUNNY, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO...

42
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,117
HE'S GOT, LIKE, A HEARING AID, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE...

43
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,618
OH..

44
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,620
BECAUSE HE'S ALL OLD, YOU KNOW?

45
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,122

46
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,133
OKAY, LOOK, ROSS...

47
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,634
JUST SO YOU KNOW

48
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,136
SINCE LIZZIE LIKES YOU SO MUCH

49
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,637
I'VE DECIDED TO ACCEPT THE FACT

50
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,139
THAT YOU'RE GOING OUT WITH HER.

51
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,141
REALLY? THAT... OKAY, THAT'S GREAT.

52
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,643
YEAH. BUT THEN I CHANGED MY MIND.

53
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,145
I'M FUNNY LIKE THAT.

54
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,147
SO I'VE TOLD LIZZIE

55
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,648
AND NOW I'M TELLING YOU--

56
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,650
I DON'T WANT YOU SEEING MY DAUGHTER ANYMORE.

57
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,653
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I I REALIZE IT UPSETS YOU...

58
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,155
YES, IT DOES.

59
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,160
BUT... ELIZABETH AND I ARE BOTH ADULTS

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,664
AND SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S REALLY ANYTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

61
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,667
I'LL CALL THE UNIVERSITY AND TELL THEM ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP

62
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,668
AND HAVE YOU FIRED.

63
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,170
OH! A MAN WITH A PLAN.    73 00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,144 OH, THIS IS SO EXCITING.

74
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,146
YOU GET YOUR PICTURE BACK UP

75
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,714
ON THE WALL OF FAME.

76
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,216
I KNOW, YEAH. HE'S GOT ALL THE BIG ACTORS.

77
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,718
IT WAS SO COOL WHEN I WAS UP THERE BEFORE.

78
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,220
ME AND JIM BELUS HI WOULD JUST BE

79
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,721
CRACKING UP ABOUT SOMETHING.

80
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,723
THEN I GET FIRED

81
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,225
OFF DAYS OF OUR LIVES

82
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,227
AND HE TAKES ME DOWN.

83
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,229
NOW HE'S JUST LAUGHING AT ME.

84
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,232
LOOK AT HIM, THAT SMUG BELUSHI BASTARD.

85
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,236
OH, OKAY, MAYBE WHEN THEY PUT YOUR PICTURE BACK UP

86
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,739
THEY COULD PUT YOU NEXT TO MATT LAUER.

87
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,741
LOOK AT HIM JUST SMILING AT ME.

88
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,744

89
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,747
YEAH, I KNOW. WE'D BE GREAT TOGETHER.

90
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,249
OH... PSST!

91
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,252
HEY. SO, I'M BACK.

92
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,253
WHO ARE YOU?

93
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,257
JOEY TRIBBIANI.

94
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,759
FROM THE WALL?

95
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,264
OKAY, MAYBE THIS WILL JOG YOUR MEMORY, HUH?

96
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,265
HUH?

97
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,269
OKAY, ANYWAY, I'M READY TO GO BACK UP ON THE WALL.

98
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,770
I'M THE STAR OF A NEW TV SHOW.

99
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,274
SHOW ME IN THE TV BOOK.

100
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,276
WELL, IT'S NOT ON TV YET.

101
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,778
WELL, THEN IT'S NOT ON THE WALL YET.

102
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:44,784
OKAY, FINE. I WILL BRING YOU A TAPE, HUH?

103
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,286
SO, NOW, DO YOU HAVE

104
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,788
ANY OF MATT LAUER'S CLOTHES HERE, MAYBE?

105
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,790
JUST ONES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN CLEANED YET?

106
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,299
I LOVE MUSEUMS.

107
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,301
SOAKING UP ALL THE CULTURE.

108
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,302
YEAH.

109
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,803
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO START?

110
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,305
OH, THE GIFT SHOP!

111
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,306
YEAH!

112
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,807
HEY, AND THEN LUNCH.

113
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,808
OH, WAIT. YES

114
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,809
BUT I CAN'T EAT TOO MUCH.

115
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,311
PAUL'S TAKING ME OUT TO DINNER TONIGHT.

116
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,313
HE SAID HE HAS A BIG SURPRISE PLANNED.

117
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,815
OH, WOW. DO YOU THINK MAYBE HE'S GOING

118
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,817
TO TELL YOU HE'S GAY?

119
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,320
WHAT? NO. WHY?

120
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,321
NO REASON.

121
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,824
THAT WOULD JUST BE A REALLY BIG SURPRISE, RIGHT?

122
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,326
YOU CAN PUT THE AISLE OVER HERE

123
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,328
AND HAVE THE WEDDING CEREMONY RIGHT OVER HERE.

124
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,330
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD GET MARRIED HERE.

125
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,332
THIS WOULD BE A BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO GET MARRIED.

126
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,833
BUT I WOULDN'T PUT THE AISLE THERE

127
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,835
AND I WOULD NEVER HAVE THE CEREMONY THERE.

128
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,838
YOU'D HAVE THE CEREMONY UNDER THIS BIG BEAUTIFUL ARCH.

129
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:39,839
MAY I HELP YOU?

130
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:40,840
OH, SORRY.

131
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,342
DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT.

132
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,843
IT'S JUST SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SPACE.

133
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,345
DO YOU DO A LOT OF WEDDINGS HERE?

134
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,347
YES. WE'RE VERY POPULAR.

135
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,849
THERE'S A TWO YEAR WAITING LIST. SORRY.

136
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,851
MONICA, YOU SHOULD

137
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,353
TOTALLY PUT YOUR NAME DOWN FOR THIS PLACE.

138
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,355
WHAT? ARE YOU CRAZY?

139
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,357
I'M NOT GETTING MARRIED.

140
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,858
I'M NOT EVEN ENGAGED.

141
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,360
BUT THERE'S A TWO YEAR WAIT.

142
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,362
AND THEN WHAT IF YOU GET ENGAGED IN TWO YEARS

143
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,365
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT TO WAIT ANOTHER TWO YEARS FOR THIS PLACE?

144
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,366
THAT'S FOUR YEARS.

145
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,368
CHANDLER'S NOT GOING TO WAIT THAT LONG.

146
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,370
HE'S GOING TO FIND SOMEBODY ELSE, YOU KNOW?

147
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,871
SOMEONE WHO DID PUT

148
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,373
THEIR NAME ON THE LIST.

149
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,375
AND IT CAN'T HURT TO PUT YOUR NAME DOWN.

150
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,377
IF, IN TWO YEARS, YOU'RE NOT ENGAGED

151
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,378
YOU JUST DON'T USE IT.

152
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,880
WELL, I GUESS THERE IS NO HARM

153
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,882
IN PUTTING MY NAME DOWN.

154
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,384
I'M GOING TO DO IT, TOO.

155
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,385
ME, TOO.

156
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,886
REALLY? WHO WOULD YOU MARRY?

157
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,887
I DON'T KNOW.

158
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,889
I DON'T HAVE ANYONE RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW?

159
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,891
OH, PHEEBS.

160
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,393
DON'T FEEL TOO SORRY FOR ME.

161
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,395
AT LEAST MY BOYFRIEND ISN'T GAY.

162
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,898
PHOEBE, THAT'S NOT...

163
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,900
DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON YOURS.

164
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,903
HEY.

165
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,905
SO, DID YOU WATCH THE TAPE OF MY SHOW?

166
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,906
I DID.

167
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,409
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET ME BACK UP THERE.

168
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,411
NO, YOU DON'T GO UP ON THE WALL.

169
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,412
WHAT?

170
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,414
BUT YOU SAW THE SHOW.

171
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,916
YES. IT WAS VERY OFFENSIVE TO MY PEOPLE.

172
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,920
DRY CLEANERS?

173
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,426
RUSSIANS. IT SHOWED THEM AS TERRORISTS AND VILLAINS.

174
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,427
OKAY, OKAY, LOOK

175
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,429
YOU GOT HARRISON FORD UP THERE.

176
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,430
THAT'S RIGHT.

177
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,432
MR. FORD IS A VERY GOOD CUSTOMER.

178
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,933
HE BRINGS US A LOT OF CLOTHES.

179
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,934
YOU BRING US NOTHING.

180
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,436
OKAY, WELL, THAT MAY BE TRUE

181
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,939
BUT IN AIR FORCE ONE,OKAY, THE RUSSIANS WERE TERRORISTS

182
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,942
AND EVIL, AND PLUS HE KILLS A BUNCH OF THEM.

183
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,444
THAT'S OFFENSIVE TO RUSSIANS.

184
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,945
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT.

185
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,947
OH, YOU SHOULD. IT'S GREAT.

186
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,455
THIS PLACE IS REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

187
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,958
YEAH. I'VE BEEN COMING HERE SINCE I WAS A KID.

188
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,460
THIS USED TO BE MY GRANDMA'S.

189
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,963
WOW. THE ONLY THING I GOT FROM MY GRANDMOTHER WAS HER EYES.

190
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,466
I MEAN, NOT HER ACTUAL EYEBALLS

191
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,469
BUT PEOPLE SAY THAT MY EYES...

192
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,471
DO YOU WANT TO MAKE OUT?

193
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,472
SURE.

194
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,976
MMM.

195
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,978
ARE YOU OKAY?

196
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,979
WHAT'S WRONG?

197
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,982
UH, I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

198
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,986
WELL, WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU.

199
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,490
NO, NO. UH...

200
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,992
HE JUST REALLY FREAKED ME OUT BEFORE.

201
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,496
OH. WELL, SO WE HAVE TO HIDE OUR RELATIONSHIP

202
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,998
FROM ONE MORE PERSON. BIG DEAL.

203
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,000
BESIDES, WE'VE HAD FUN HIDING IT.

204
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,504
YEAH.

205
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,006
MMM.

206
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,509
HEY, UM, YOU BROUGHT PROTECTION, RIGHT?

207
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,512
WHY? ARE THERE, LIKE, BEARS OR SOMETHING?

208
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,514
NO.

209
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,516
OH. OH!

210
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,017
OH, PROTECTION.

211
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,020
NO, YEAH. NO, THAT THAT I FORGOT.

212
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,525
I CAN'T BELIEVE I BROUGHT TWO CANS OF BIG SPRAY

213
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,026
AND FORGOT THAT.

214
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,529
I'LL JUST RUN TO THE STORE AND GET SOME.

215
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,530
NO, HEY, HEY, I'M THE GUY.

216
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,031
I'LL GET IT.

217
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,032
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE STORE IS?

218
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,034
NO.

219
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,536
DO YOU WANT TO RIDE AROUND TOWN

220
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,037
ON MY LITTLE PINK BICYCLE?

221
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,040
A LITTLE BIT.

222
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,042
I'LL BE BACK IN TEN MINUTES.

223
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,043
OKAY.

224
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,044
WHY DON'T YOU GET IN THE HOT TUB

225
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,546
AND I'LL MEET YOU THERE?

226
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,047
OKAY.

227
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,061

228
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,064
 OH, MY GOD, WHAT A GREAT SURPRISE.

229
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,566
THIS IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE.

230
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,068
 THANK YOU. IT USED TO BE MY MOTHER'S.

231
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,069
THIS IS THE KITCHEN.

232
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,574
HEY, CHANDLER.

233
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,575
HEY, JOE.

234
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,585
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE DOING SOMETHING.

235
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,088

236
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,090
 You've reached Monica and Chandler's.

237
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,592
If you're listening to this message

238
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,093
we're probably screening.

239
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,094
YEAH, WE ARE.

240
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,596

241
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,598
Hi. This is Hildy from the Morgan-Chase Museum.

242
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,099
I'm calling for Monica Geller.

243
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,102
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation

244
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,604

in having the Bing-Geller wedding in our facility

246
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,108

247
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,611
THIS IS CHANDLER BING! THIS IS CHANDLER BING!

248
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,113
YES, THE GROOM.

249
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,115
NO, NOT THE GROOM!

250
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,121
IT'S SO SECLUDED UP HERE.

251
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,623
I KNOW.

252
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,125
THAT'S WHY I LIKE IT HERE.

253
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,627
MM HMM. I FEEL LIKE WE'RE

254
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,128
THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.

255
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,130
WHOOPS.

256
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,632
SORRY.

257
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:34,634

258
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,138
WHAT'S THE MATTER, HONEY?

259
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,140
DID YOU SEE A LITTLE MOUSE?

260
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,141
NO, NO. BIG BEAR.

261
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,142
BIG BEAR OUTSIDE.

262
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,644
I THOUGHT I HEARD A BEAR.

263
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,646
WOULD YOU GO CHECK ON THAT?

264
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,647
HONEY, WE DON'T HAVE

265
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,148
ANY BEARS HERE.

266
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,650
WELL, OKAY.

267
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,152
W WOULD YOU GET ME A DIET COKE?

268
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,654
OKAY.

269
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,655
BE RIGHT BACK.

270
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,156
OKAY.

271
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,157
OKAY.

272
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,162
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

273
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,163
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

274
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,665
I CAME WITH PAUL.

275
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,166
YEAH, I RECOGNIZE THE ANKLES.

276
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,669
WHERE IS ELIZABETH?

277
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,170
SHE'S AT THE STORE.

278
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,673
WHAT? YOU LET THE GIRL GO TO THE STORE?

279
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,174
DO I KNOW WHERE THE STORE IS?

280
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,676
GET OUT. GET OUT.

281
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,179

282
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,181
OH, THANK YOU.

283
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,683
DIET COKE.

284
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,685
OH... ICE.

285
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,187
I NEED ICE.

286
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,190
OKAY.

00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,204
NO, NOT IN THERE. NOT IN THERE.

294
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,205
HE'S IN THERE.

295
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,708
DID YOU REALLY HEAR A BEAR?

296
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,709
GO!

297
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,714

OH, THANK YOU.

OH, LOOK! ELIZABETH'S HERE!

305
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,733
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

306
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,236
YOU GUYS?

307
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,238
HOW DID YOU KNOW WE WERE HERE?

308
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,240
UM...

309
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,743
WELL, SHE OBVIOUSLY SAW THE TIRE TRACKS.

00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,746

00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,248
OBVIOUSLY.

312
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,750
ELIZABETH...

313
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,753

WELL, WHY DON'T YOU, YOU KNOW

OH, I WOULDN'T DO IT IN THERE, UM...

00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,271
THAT'S MY DAD'S BEDROOM.

321
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,776
THAT'S YOUR... THAT'S YOUR DAD'S BEDROOM.

326
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,288
WHOO!

00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,293
HI, HONEY.

WHAT? I I BOUGHT GROCERIES.

330
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,299
I WAS GOING TO MAKE YOU DINNER.

00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,801
WELL, NEXT TIME, ASK.

332
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,807
OR, AT LEAST, WAIT FOR ME TO ASK.

333
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,817

334
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,319
Hi, this is Hildy from the Morgan-Chase Museum.

335
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,321
I'm calling for Monica Geller.

336
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,823
OH, NO.

337
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,325
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation

338
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,326
and, if she's still interested

339
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,828
in having the Bing-Geller wedding

340
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,830

00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,831
OH, PLEASE.

342
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,332
OH, PLEASE, HE DIDN'T HEAR IT.

343
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,333
HE DIDN'T HEAR IT!

344
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,836
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!

345
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,340
NO!

346
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,343

347
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,845
UH... YEAH. WHERE'S THE GUY

348
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,347
WHO DECIDES WHOSE PICTURES GO UP ON THE WALL?

349
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,849
HE'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW.

350
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,350
OH, YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

351
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,853
ALL RIGHT, WELL, MAKE SURE YOU TELL HIM THAT JOEY TRIBBIANI

352
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,855
STOPPED BY TO DROP OFF ALL THESE CLOTHES.

353
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,856
I'M AN ACTOR.

354
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,358
I'M TRYING TO GET MY PICTURE UP THERE ON THE WALL.

355
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,360
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE

356
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,863
WHO COULD GET YOUR PICTURE UP THERE.

357
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,865
OH, REALLY?

358
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,368
WELL, MAYBE YOU AND I GO OUT FOR DRINKS.

359
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,371
YOU'RE THE OTHER ONE, RIGHT?

360
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,377
SO, LIZZIE, ARE YOU PLANNING ON STAYING THE NIGHT?

361
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,879
OH, NO, NO.

362
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,881
BELIEVE ME, I'M LEAVING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

363
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,883
GOOD. GOOD.

364
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,885
NOT THAT WE DON'T WANT YOU TO STAY.

365
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,887
OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE WELCOME.

366
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,889
HOW MUCH MORE HOMEWORK DO YOU HAVE?

367
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,891
UH, I JUST HAVE ONE PROBLEM LEFT

368
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,893
THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SOLVE.

369
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,395
UH, RACHEL, MAYBE YOU WANT TO COME UPSTAIRS

370
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,897
AND HELP ME FIGURE IT OUT?

371
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,398
REALLY?

372
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,400
OKAY.

373
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,903
OKAY, I I'LL GO UPSTAIRS...

374
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,907
IF IF YOU... GET ME SOMETHING FROM THE CAR.

375
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,908
WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM THE CAR?

376
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,910
SURPRISE ME.

377
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,917
SO, YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN THE CAR

378
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,418
I WILL BE UPSTAIRS

379
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,420
AND THAT'S WHERE EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE!

380
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,444

381
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,445
JUST RELAX, JUST RELAX.

382
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,947
PAUL, YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

383
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,448
SHE LIKES YOU.

384
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:50,950
SHE...

385
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,951
I THINK SHE LIKES YOU.

386
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,452
SHE LIKES YOU.

387
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,453
YOU KNOW WHY?

388
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,454
BECAUSE YOU'RE A...

389
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,957
NEAT GUY.

390
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,961
YOU ARE THE MAN.

391
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,463
YOU ARE THE MAN!

392
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,468
STILL GOT IT.

393
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,970

394
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,472
STILL SEXY.

395
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,975
YOU'RE JUST A LOVE MACHINE.

396
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,477
?? I'M JUST A LOVE MACHINE ??

397
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,480
?? AND I DON'T WORK FOR NOBODY BUT YOU ??

398
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,984
?? YEAH, BABY, HUH! ??

399
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,987

400
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,993
SHOW TIME.

401
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,495
?? I'M JUST A LOVE MACHINE ??

402
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,997
?? YEAH, BABY! ??

403
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,999
?? HUH! ??

404
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,501
PHOEBE... YEAH?

405
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,003
HAVE YOU SEEN CHANDLER?

406
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,004
NO, WHY?

407
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,005
THE WOMAN FROM THE MUSEUM CALLED

408
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,506
AND SAID THAT THERE WAS A CANCELLATION

409
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,008
AND THAT WE COULD MOVE UP OUR WEDDING

410
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,009
AND CHANDLER HEARD.

411
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,011
 I KNOW.

412
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,512
HOW BAD IS THIS?

413
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,514
WELL, WITH A REGULAR GUY, IT'S BAD.

414
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,516
WITH CHANDLER-- OH, DEAR GOD!

415
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,018
I KNOW, I KNOW.

416
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,519
AND HE TOTALLY FREAKED OUT

417
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,021
AND I CAN'T FIND HIM ANYWHERE.

418
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,522
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

419
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,024
I'M NEVER GOING TO LISTEN TO YOU AGAIN

420
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,025
THAT'S FOR SURE.

421
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,027
AND WHAT HARM CAN IT DO

422
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,528
IF YOU JUST PUT YOUR NAME DOWN?

423
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,030
RACHEL SAID THAT.

424
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,531
WELL, RACHEL'S NOT HERE!

425
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,538
DO YOU REALLY THINK

426
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,540
SHE PUT YOUR PICTURE UP ALREADY?

427
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,541
DID SHE PUT MY PICTURE UP?

428
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,043
YOU KIDDING?

429
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,545
D AFTER THE DATE WE HAD, I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISE

430
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,047
IF SHE PUT TEN OF MY PICTURES UP THERE

431
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,549
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT I ONLY GAVE HER ONE.

432
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,052
I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE WOULD HAVE GOT THE OTHER NINE.

433
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,556
OOH, HERE IT IS.

434
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,559
OOH, JOEY, WHY DID YOU SIGN IT "SON OF A BITCH"?

435
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,063
I DIDN'T DO THAT.

436
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,065
WHO WOULD'VE DONE THAT?

437
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,066
SON OF A BITCH!

438
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,568
OKAY, MAYBE ASK THIS GUY.

439
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,569
YOU--

440
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,071
GET OUT OF MY SHOP!

441
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,072
WHAT DID HE DO?

442
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,573
HE WENT OUT WITH MY WIFE!

443
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,574
JOEY!

444
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,077
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

445
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,079
HEY, I DID NOT GO OUT WITH YOUR WIFE, OKAY?

446
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,081
I WENT OUT WITH HER.

447
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,082
THAT'S MY WIFE!

448
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,085
I... I... I'M NOT POINTING AT HER. NO.

449
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,087
I'M POINTING AT... AT HER...

450
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,588
ZELDA McMURRAY.

451
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,590
WHO THE HELL...?

452
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,592
HOW DID SHE GET UP THERE?

453
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:14,593
GET OUT!

454
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,596

455
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,597
WELL, WE SHOULD GO.

456
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,598
YEAH.

457
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,102
ROSS?

458
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,606
ROSS?

459
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,108
ELIZABETH.

460
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,612
OKAY... OKAY...

461
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,615
I'M GOING TO GO OUT THIS WINDOW.

462
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,117
I'LL MEET YOU AT THE FRONT DOOR.

463
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,618
JUST TELL THEM YOU'RE GOING HOME, OKAY?

464
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,619
OKAY.

465
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,620
 WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

466
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,621
NO, DON'T GO IN THERE!

467
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,123
DON'T GO IN THERE!

468
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,125
I NEED ANOTHER SODA.

469
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,127
ROSS!

470
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,629
OH, MY GOD! ROSS!

471
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,632
WHAT IN HEAVEN'S NAME ARE YOU DOING HERE?

472
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,137
AND THAT IS WHY

473
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,140
WE CANNOT SEE EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

474
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,643
ROSS...

475
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,645
YOU AND I ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE TALK.

476
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,646
DADDY, UH...

477
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,147
YOU'RE NEXT!

478
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,149
OKAY. I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS HERE.

479
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,154
LET ME JUST SEE IF I GOT THIS STRAIGHT.

480
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,656
I TELL YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM MY DAUGHTER

481
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,158
OR I'LL HAVE YOU FIRED.

482
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,659
WHAT YOU HEARD WAS:

483
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,162
"TAKE MY DAUGHTER, COME UP TO MY COUNTRY HOUSE

484
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,663
AND RUIN MY WEEKEND WITH RACHEL."

485
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,165
OKAY, PLEASE, PLEASE, PAUL

486
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,166
JUST LET ME EXPLAIN.

487
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,167
NO, LET ME EXPLAIN!

488
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,169
FIRED!

489
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,171
OKAY, FINE, FINE.

490
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,672
HAVE ME FIRED.

491
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,676
BUT, UH, I WANT YOU TO KNOW

492
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,180
THAT YOU AND I ARE NOT ALL THAT DIFFERENT.

493
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,182
I MEAN...

494
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,684
I, TOO, AM A NEAT GUY.

495
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,696
WHAT?

496
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,698
AND I, TOO

497
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,702
AM JUST A LOVE MACHINE.

498
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:10,209

499
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,214

500
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,223
ROSS...

501
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,227
LET ME SHOW YOU WHERE THE GUEST ROOM IS.

502
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,241
I'M SO SORRY.

503
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,243
PLEASE STOP FREAKING OUT.

504
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,245
I'M NOT FREAKING OUT.

505
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,249
WHY WOULD I BE FREAKING OUT?

506
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,751
A WOMAN NAMED HILDY CALLED TO SAY WE WERE GETTING MARRIED

507
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,253
BUT THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY.

508
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,255
WAH AHHH AHHH!

509
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,759
HONEY, WE WERE AT THIS BEAUTIFUL PLACE

510
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,262
AND I JUST PUT OUR NAMES DOWN FOR FUN.

511
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,763
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE HARM IN THAT?

512
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,764
RIGHT HERE.

513
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,766

514
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,769
CHANDLER, PLEASE DON'T THINK I WAS TRYING TO PRESSURE YOU.

515
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,272
PHOEBE AND RACHEL JUST THOUGHT THAT...

516
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,773
PHOEBE AND RACHEL...

517
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,276
SO THE PEOPLE THAT KNEW ABOUT OUR WEDDING BEFORE ME

518
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,777
WERE YOU, PHOEBE AND RACHEL

519
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,279
HILDY, AND, APPARENTLY, SOME BAND

520
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,281
CALLED THE STARLIGHT MAGIC SEVEN

521
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,782
WHO ARE AVAILABLE, BY THE WAY.

522
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,785
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

523
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,788
PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS TO MEAN ANYTHING

524
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,790
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T.

525
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,794
OKAY.

526
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,796
REALLY?

527
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,798
YES, IF IT REALLY DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING

528
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,301
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT I'M JUST NOT READY...

529
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,802
I KNOW.

530
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,804
I KNOW.

531
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,306
OKAY.

532
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,307
ALL RIGHT.

533
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,810
NOW I'M GOING TO GO TELL JOEY THAT YOU'RE BACK.

534
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,812
HE WAS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

535
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,815
YOU KNOW, AND THAT GUY THAT NEVER DELIVERED HIS BURRITO?

536
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,318
HE THOUGHT THERE WAS SOME SORT OF CONNECTION.

537
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,825
HEY, DID SHE BUY IT?

538
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,327
TOTALLY.

539
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,828
SO DID HILDY SHOW YOU THE PLACE?

540
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,331
YEAH. IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

541
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,834
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE GOING TO ASK MONICA TO MARRY YOU.

542
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,336
I KNOW.

544
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,350
HEY, GUNTHER.

545
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,352
HEY. TAKE THESE CAPPUCCINOS TO TABLE 11

546
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,854
AND THAT GUY OVER THERE WANTS SOME BISCOTTI.

547
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,856
OH, UH, WELL, I JUST, ACTUALLY, CAME IN

548
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,358
FOR A CUP OF COFFEE TO GO.

549
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,861
DO YOU STILL WORK HERE?

550
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,365
NO, NO. I QUIT A LONG TIME AGO.

551
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,868
DID I FORGET TO TELL YOU THAT? I'M SORRY.

552
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,371
NO, THAT'S COOL. I WAS GOING TO FIRE YOU ANYWAY.

553
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,372
GREAT!
