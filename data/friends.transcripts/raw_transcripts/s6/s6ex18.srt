1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,505
HEY, I JUST GOT MY, UH... TEACHER EVALUATIONS.

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,507
CHECK OUT WHAT THIS ONE STUDENT WROTE.

3
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,509
"I LOVED DR. GELLER'S CLASS.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,511
"MIND BLOWING LECTURES.

5
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,014
"DR. GELLER, YOU ARE DEFINITELY

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,517
THE 'HOTTIE' OF THE PALEONTOLOGY DEPARTMENT."

7
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,518
AH...

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,021
"HOTTIES OF THE PALEONTOLOGY DEPARTMENT."

9
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,023
THERE'S A BIG SELLING CALENDAR, HUH?

10
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,525
WHO WROTE IT?

11
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,027
OH, I WISH I KNEW

12
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,528
BUT THE EVALUATIONS ARE ALL ANONYMOUS.

13
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,030
DO YOU STILL HAVE THEIR FINAL EXAMS?

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:30,530
YEAH.

15
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,032
OH. BECAUSE YOU COULD JUST MATCH

16
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,533
THE EVALUATION TO THE EXAM

17
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,035
WITH THE SAME HANDWRITING AND, BOOM

18
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,536
THERE'S YOUR ADMIRER.

19
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,537
A HOT GIRL'S AT STAKE

20
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,040
AND, ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE'S RAIN MAN.

21
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,043
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

22
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,545
WHY ARE WE SO SURE THAT THIS IS A GIRL?

23
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,051
IT'S A GIRL.

24
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,054
ANYWAY, IT WOULDN'T MATTER, OKAY?

25
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,056
BECAUSE I'M A TEACHER, SHE'S A STUDENT.

26
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,557
OH, IS THAT AGAINST THE RULES?

27
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,059
NO, BUT IT IS FROWNED UPON.

28
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,560
I SEE.

29
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,062
BESIDES, THERE'S A BIG AGE DIFFERENCE.

30
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,563
WELL, THINK OF IT LIKE THIS:

31
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,564
WHEN YOU'RE 90...

32
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,066
I KNOW. WHEN I'M 90, SHE'LL BE, LIKE, 80

33
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,068
AND IT WON'T SEEM LIKE SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE.

34
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:12,072
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY AT ALL.

35
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,573
NO. WHAT I WAS GOING

36
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,076
TO SAY IS WHEN YOU'RE 90, YOU'LL STILL HAVE THE MEMORY

37
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,577
OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE

38
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,578
WITH A 20 YEAR OLD.

48
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,119
MONICA?

49
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,121
I DON'T KNOW.

50
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,122
OKAY.

51
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,124
HEY, CHANDLER, YOU KNOW THAT GIRL

52
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,627
YOU WENT TO COLLEGE WITH WHO BECAME A MOVIE DIRECTOR?

53
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,129
OH, YEAH, DANA KEYSTONE.

54
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,630
SHE WAS IN MY MOVEMENT CLASS.

55
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,632
WHAT'S A MOVEMENT CLASS?

56
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,135
IT'S CHANDLER'S WAY OF PRETENDING

57
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,136
HE DIDN'T TAKE MIME.

58
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,139
WELL, LISTEN, ANYWAY, SHE'S DIRECTING

59
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,640
THE NEW AL PACINO MOVIE.

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,641
YOU GOT TO GET ME AN AUDITION.

61
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,143
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

62
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,144
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HER IN, LIKE, TEN YEARS.

63
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,146
OH, NO, NO, NO. PLEASE, PLEASE, CHANDLER?

64
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,147
I WOULD OWE YOU SO MUCH.

65
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,149
YOU DO OWE ME SO MUCH.

66
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,650
YOU OWE ME $3,400...

67
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,653
DUDE, WHY ARE YOU CHANGING THE SUBJECT?

68
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,156
WILL YOU MAKE THE CALL OR WHAT?

69
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,657
OKAY, I'LL TRY. ALL RIGHT.

70
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,658
THANKS. YOU'RE THE BEST.

71
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,659
NOW, LISTEN

72
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,661
THE LAST DAY OF AUDITIONS IS THURSDAY, OKAY?

73
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,663
SO I GOT TO GET IN THERE BY THURSDAY, OKAY?

74
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,165
JUST REMEMBER THURSDAY. THURSDAY.

75
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,166
CAN YOU REMEMBER THURSDAY?

76
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,668
YEAH, SO, TUESDAY?

77
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,171
THURSDAY.

78
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,173
LOOK, IF YOU NEED HELP REMEMBERING

79
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,174
JUST THINK OF IT LIKE THIS:

80
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,176
THE THIRD DAY, ALL RIGHT?

81
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,677
MONDAY, ONE DAY.

82
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,679
TUESDAY, TWO DAY.

83
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,681
WEDNESDAY, WHEN? HUH? WHAT DAY?

84
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,183
THURSDAY!

85
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,186
THE THIRD DAY, OKAY?

86
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,188
THANK YOU.

87
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,689
OKAY.

88
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,691
HEY, MONICA...

89
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,693
SHE DOESN'T KNOW.

90
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:17,197
HEY, MON, I'M GOING TO CHECK MY MESSAGES.

91
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,199
YOU JUST THOUGHT OF THAT IN THERE?

92
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,700
SURE. YOU KNOW, NATURE CALLED.

93
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,202
SHE WANTED TO SEE WHO ELSE DID.

94
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,706
HELLO.

95
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,208
UH, RACHEL.

96
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,709
YOU GUYS, SOMEONE IS IN OUR APARTMENT.

97
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,711
CALL THE COPS!

98
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,214
YOU'RE ON THE PHONE!

99
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,715
OH, MY GOD!

100
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,217
WHAT?

101
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,218
OH, MY GOD. THANK YOU.

102
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,719
THAT WAS THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

103
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,221
THERE WAS A FIRE AT OUR PLACE!

104
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,222
OH, MY GOD!

105
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,223
HOW BAD WAS IT?

106
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,725
WELL, HE DIDN'T SAY, BUT IT WAS A FIRE.

107
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,227
I'M GUESSING NOT VERY GOOD.

108
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,228
COME ON. WE GOT TO GO.

109
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,729
YEAH, COME ON.

110
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,232
WHAT ARE YOU SMILING ABOUT?

111
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,733
WHAT IS SO FUNNY?

112
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,736
THE PART I WANT TO AUDITION FOR IS A FIREMAN.

113
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,238
THIS IS SO MEANT TO BE!

114
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,247
WOW!

115
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,748
LOOKS LIKE YOU WERE VERY GENEROUS

116
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,250
WITH YOUR GRADES THIS SEMESTER.

117
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,751

118
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,757
PROFESSOR GELLER?

119
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,758
YEAH?

120
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,260
I WANTED TO SAY

121
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,262
HOW MUCH I ENJOYED YOUR CLASS.

122
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,263
OH, THANK YOU.

123
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,264
THANKS VERY MUCH.

124
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,266
OW.

125
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,767
UM, I'M A LITTLE EMBARRASSED

126
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,270
ABOUT CALLING YOU A HOTTIE ON MY EVALUATION.

127
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,271
THAT WAS YOU?

128
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,272
YEAH.

129
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,274
I FELT A LITTLE WEIRD ABOUT IT.

130
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,275
YOU'RE A TEACHER.

131
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,276
I'M A STUDENT

132
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,777
BUT WOULD YOU

133
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,779
MAYBE WANT TO GO OUT WITH ME SOMETIME?

134
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,783
OH, I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE THE BEST IDEA.

135
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,287
OH, BECAUSE I WAS THINKING... THE SEMESTER IS OVER.

136
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,789
YOU'RE NOT MY TEACHER ANYMORE.

137
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,790
WHAT TIME?

138
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,295
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? FORGET IT.

139
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,297
I SEE YOU ALREADY GAVE ME AN "A."

140
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,799
GOTCHA.

141
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,801
I'M KIDDING! GOD!

142
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,802
OH.

143
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,306
SO, SERIOUSLY, WHAT TIME?

144
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,310
 COMING THROUGH.

145
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,311
OH! COMING THROUGH.

146
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,312
OH, HELLO.

147
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,813
HI.

148
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,814
NO. RIGHT.

149
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:15,815
COMING THROUGH.

150
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,317
OKAY, WELL, IT'S NOT SO BAD.

151
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,318
YEAH, MOST OF THE DAMAGE

152
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,820
IS PRETTY MUCH CONTAINED TO THE BEDROOMS.

153
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,822
HEY, BUDDY. OH!

154
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,325
THINK I COULD BORROW YOUR UNIFORM THIS THURSDAY?

155
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,826
EXCUSE ME?

156
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,329
JOEY, HE'S WORKING.

157
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,831
YOU WOULD LOOK GOOD IN THAT.

158
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,834
HOW BAD IS IT?

159
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,836
OH, IT'S BAD. IT'S REALLY BAD.

160
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:40,340
THE ONLY THING THERE THAT ISN'T BURNED IS AN AX...

161
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,342
WHICH I DO NOT REMEMBER BUYING.

162
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,343
HOW'S YOUR ROOM, RACH?

163
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,845
EVERYTHING'S RUINED: MY BED, MY CLOTHES.

164
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,347
LOOK AT MY FAVORITE BLUE SWEATER.

165
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,848
ISN'T THAT MINE?

166
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,352
FINE. I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

167
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,853
SO, UH, YOU'RE NOT

168
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,855
GOING TO BE ABLE TO LIVE HERE FOR A WHILE.

169
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,357
YOU LADIES HAVE A PLACE TO STAY?

170
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,361
OH, WOW. OKAY.

171
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,864
LOOK, PAL, I AM NOT IN THE MOOD

172
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,865
TO BE HIT ON RIGHT NOW.

173
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,867
BUT IF YOU GIVE ME YOUR NUMBER

174
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,869
I WILL CALL YOU SOME OTHER TIME.

175
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,374
YES. THEY CAN STAY WITH US.

176
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,375
HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT

177
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,377
WHAT STARTED THE FIRE, MR. FIREMAN?

178
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,380
WELL, UH, DO EITHER OF YOU SMOKE?

179
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,881
NO, NOT USUALLY

180
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,384
BUT, YEAH, I COULD USE ONE RIGHT NOW. THANKS.

181
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,386
NO, NO, NO. DO YOU LIGHT CANDLES, BURN INCENSE?

182
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,888
YES, I DO ALL THE TIME.

183
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,390
I LOVE THEM!

184
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,391
OH, MY GOD. I DID IT.

185
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,892
IT'S ME, IT'S ME.

186
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,395
I BURNED DOWN THE HOUSE! I BURNED DOWN THE HOUSE!

187
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,397
OKAY, PHOEBE, CALM DOWN. THERE'S NO NEED

188
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,899
TO PLACE BLAME, OKAY?

189
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,402
I WARNED HER ABOUT THOSE CANDLES.

190
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,906
GOD, IT'S GREAT TO CATCH UP.

191
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,908
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW LONG IT'S BEEN.

192
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,410
HEY, CHANDLER, IS THAT...?

193
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,913
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

194
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,914
GOOD FOR YOU.

195
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,915
HEY, HEY, HEY, IS IT...?

196
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,921
OKAY, SO, YEAH, MAYBE WE CAN GET TOGETHER, UM...

197
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,429
CAN YOU HOLD ON FOR ONE SECOND, PLEASE?

198
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,431
WHAT?

199
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,933
WHEN YOU'RE OFF THE PHONE, YOU WANT TO GET A PIZZA?

200
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,936
HI. I'M BACK.

201
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,438
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

202
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,440
OKAY, WELL, WE'LL DO IT THEN.

203
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,441
OKAY, BYE.

204
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,444

205
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,945
HEY, LISTEN, SO WHEN'S MY AUDITION?

206
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,946
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S THURSDAY

207
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,947
BUT WHAT TIME?

208
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,449
HEY. HI.

209
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,451
WE DIDN'T GET TO THE AUDITION.

210
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,953
I'LL TAKE HER TO COFFEE AND THEN WE'LL DO IT THEN.

211
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,455
WOW. SO, NOW YOU'RE GOING

212
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,956
ON A DATE WITH THIS GIRL?

213
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,957
HONEY, IT IS NOT A DATE.

214
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,459
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HER IN TEN YEARS.

215
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,460
YOU CAN'T CALL UP SOMEBODY

216
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,961
YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO IN TEN YEARS

217
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,463
AND ASK THEM FOR A FAVOR.

218
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,464
THERE ARE RULES.

219
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,965
YOU GOT TO PUT IN SOME TIME.

220
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:46,966
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY.

221
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,468
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE, YOU KNOW

222
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,469
GOING OUT WITH AN EX GIRLFRIEND.

223
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:50,970
NO. WE ONLY WENT OUT ONCE.

224
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,972
YOU DATED HER?!

225
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,475
NOT ONCE.

226
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,978
GREAT. WELL, WHY DON'T I JUST GO OUT WITH AN EX BOYFRIEND

227
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,980
YOU KNOW, AND DO JOEY A FAVOR?

228
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,982
HEY, YOU WANT TO DO JOEY A FAVOR?

229
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,484
MAYBE YOU GO OUT WITH JOEY.

230
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,489

231
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,993
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

232
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,496
MY FRIEND JOEY'S IN THE MOVIE BUSINESS.

233
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,498
MM, YOU KNOW WHO I RAN INTO FROM SCHOOL?

234
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,499
HOWIE.

235
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,002
MY FRIEND'S NAME IS JOEY.

236
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,505
APPARENTLY, HOWIE'S EDITING NOW.

237
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,507
YEAH. HE CALLS ME UP AND ASKS ME

238
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,509
IF HE CAN EDIT MY NEW MOVIE.

239
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,010
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

240
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,513
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO HIM

241
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,016
IN WHAT, TEN YEARS, AND HE ASKS ME FOR A FAVOR?

242
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,522
YEAH, I'VE ALWAYS HATED THAT HOWIE.

243
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,524
NO, NO "HOW YOU DOING?"

244
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:48,027
MAN, I MEAN, NOT EVEN A CUP OF COFFEE FIRST.

245
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,529
THE NERVE, HUH?

246
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,530
YEAH.

247
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,031
REFILL?

248
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,534
NOW, THIS IS LAST MINUTE

249
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,036
SO I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE MESS, OKAY?

250
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,037
WHO CARES?

251
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,041
OH, MY GOD.

252
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,043
SURE DIDN'T LOOK THIS WAY

253
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,545
WHEN I LIVED HERE.

254
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,046
I KNOW!

255
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,048
NOW, LOOK

256
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,049
THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM.

257
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,551
THERE'S ONLY ROOM FOR ONE

258
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,553
SO I GUESS ONE OF YOU WILL HAVE TO STAY AT JOEY'S.

259
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,055
WELL, SINCE THE FIRE WAS KIND OF MY FAULT

260
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,558
I GUESS YOU SHOULD GET TO STAY HERE.

261
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,059
HEY, HEY, HEY, NOW, THIS WAS

262
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,061
NO ONE'S FAULT, PHEEBS, OKAY?

263
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,563
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

264
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,565
IT WAS MY FAULT, SO YOU SHOULD GET THE NICE ROOM.

265
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,566
OKAY!

266
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,567
WHOO WHOO!

267
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,068
RACH, YOU'RE THE FIRST GUEST

268
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,570
AT HOTEL MONICA.

269
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,571
HOTEL MONICA!

270
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,572
JUST TELL ME HOW

271
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,073
YOU LIKE YOUR EGGS IN THE MORNING.

272
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,576
I THOUGHT I WOULD BRING THEM TO YOU, YOU KNOW, IN BED.

273
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,077
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH.

274
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,579
I HAVE.

275
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,584
THIS RIGHT HERE IS WHERE I KEEP THE PIZZA

276
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,587
AND, UH, THAT'S WHERE THE NAPKIN IS.

277
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,589
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

278
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,591
I KNOW.

279
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,095
OH, PLEASE.

280
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,097
IT WAS SUCH A BIG CLASS.

281
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,599
YOU NEVER EVEN NOTICED ME.

282
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,100
WHAT? OF COURSE, I DID.

283
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,604
YOU, UH, YOU SAT NEXT TO SLEEPY SLEEPERSON.

284
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,605
WHO?

285
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,106
OH, UH, I HAD TROUBLE

286
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,608
REMEMBERING EVERYONE'S NAME

287
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,110
SO I KIND OF CAME UP WITH NICKNAMES.

288
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,613
LIKE THE GUY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF YOU WAS

289
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,114
UH, SMELLY VON BROWN SHIRT.

290
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,116
OH, YEAH.

291
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,119
SO, UH, DID YOU HAVE A NICKNAME FOR ME?

292
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,121
OH, NO, NO.

293
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,122
YES, YOU DID.

294
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,123
WHAT WAS IT?

295
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:28,628
UM, IT'S CUTIE McPRETTY.

296
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:33,633
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.

297
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,134
LISTEN, I GOT TO TELL YOU

298
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,135
I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME.

299
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,137
YOU KNOW HOW BEFORE YOU SAID

300
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,138
IT MIGHT BE WEIRD

301
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,640
THE WHOLE STUDENT TEACHER THING?

302
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,141
AND TO BE FRANK

303
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,143
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE, TOO, BUT IT'S NOT.

304
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,645
I MEAN, IT'S NOT AT ALL.

305
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:50,650
DR. GELLER!

306
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,151
BURT!

307
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,656
SO, DID YOU SLEEP WELL LAST NIGHT?

308
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,157
I DID. YEAH?

309
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,659
MONICA WAS SO SWEET.

310
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,661
SHE LEFT A LITTLE MINT ON MY PILLOW.

311
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,663
YOU KNOW WHAT JOEY LEFT ON MY PILLOW?

312
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,664
WHAT?

313
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,665
GUM.

314
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,168
WELL, WE DETERMINED THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE.

315
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,169
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.

316
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,171
IT WAS MY CANDLE, MY CANDLE.

317
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,174
NO. THERE WAS AN APPLIANCE LEFT ON IN THE BATHROOM.

318
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,676
IT LOOKS LIKE A CURLING IRON.

319
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,177
I DON'T USE A CURLING IRON.

320
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,178
WELL, SOMEONE DOES.

321
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,681
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

322
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,683
MY HAIR'S STRAIGHT. STRAIGHT, STRAIGHT, STRAIGHT.

323
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,685
COULD HAVE BEEN A HAIR STRAIGHTENER.

324
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,688
OH.

325
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,691
THIS IS WHERE I KEEP THE PIZZA

326
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,194
AND... HEY, WHERE'D THE NAPKIN GO?

327
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,698
WHAT IS THAT?

328
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,701
IS THAT OLD SHRIMP?

329
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,204
I THINK IT IS!

330
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,712
NOW, THERE YOU GO.

331
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,214
I WOULDN'T WANT MY BEST GUEST TO STRAIN HER EYES.

332
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,216
THANKS, MONICA.

333
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,718
DOES THAT SMELL BOTHER YOU?

334
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,719
THE SMELL FROM JOEY'S?

335
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,221
NO. I CAN HARDLY SMELL IT OVER HERE.

336
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,223
WELL, YOU LET ME KNOW IF YOU CAN.

337
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,226
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I CAN BAKE A PIE TO COVER IT.

338
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,228
I CAN SMELL IT A LITTLE.

339
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,229
BAKE THE PIE.

340
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,230
OKAY.

341
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,233

342
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,736
HELLO.

343
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,737
OH, YES. ONE MINUTE, PLEASE.

344
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,739
IT'S FOR YOU. IT'S THE FIRE INSPECTOR.

345
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,740
OH.

346
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,741
HELLO.

347
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,743
YEAH, THIS IS PHOEBE.

348
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,244
REALLY?

349
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,746
YEAH.

350
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,247
SO, IT TURNS OUT

351
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,749
THAT IT WASN'T THE HAIR STRAIGHTENER

352
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,250
THAT STARTED THE FIRE.

353
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,752
NO, NO. IT WAS THE CANDLES.

354
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,753
YEAH.

355
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,254
IT'S VERY NOT GOOD

356
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,757
LEAVING CANDLES UNATTENDED.

357
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,759
IN FACT, ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS

358
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,261
THEY TEACH YOU IN FIRE SCHOOL

359
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,763
IS, UH...

360
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,266
UH, OKAY.

361
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,768
WELL, I HAVE TO GO NOW.

362
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,274
WE HAD SUCH A GREAT TIME.

363
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,275
SHE'S INCREDIBLE.

364
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,778
I THOUGHT THE AGE DIFFERENCE MIGHT BE A PROBLEM

365
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,279
BUT IT WASN'T.

366
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,280
IT WASN'T AT ALL.

367
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,282
ELIZABETH IS VERY MATURE FOR HER AGE.

368
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,790
A CONCEPT LOST ON SOME PEOPLE.

369
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,792
SO, IT'S OKAY TO DATE A STUDENT?

370
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,293
WELL, NOT REALLY.

371
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,294
I MEAN, TECHNICALLY

372
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,296
IT'S NOT AGAINST THE RULES OR ANYTHING

373
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,297
BUT IT IS FROWNED UPON.

374
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,299
ESPECIALLY BY THAT PROFESSOR

375
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,801
WE RAN INTO LAST NIGHT--

376
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,302
JUDGEY VON HOLIER THAN THOU.

377
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,807
WELL, ROSS, YOU JUST BE CAREFUL, OKAY?

378
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,308
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET A REPUTATION

379
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,310
AS, YOU KNOW, PROFESSOR McNAILS HIS STUDENTS.

380
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,814
YEAH.

381
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,315
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

382
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,817
WELL, ROSS, IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR.

383
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,318
I MEAN, WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT--

384
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,820
WHAT PEOPLE THINK OR HOW YOU FEEL?

385
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,322
ROSS, YOU GOT TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART.

386
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,824
JOEY, THAT IS SO SWEET.

387
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,329
HEY.

388
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,331
HEY, HEY, SO, HOW'D IT GO WITH DANA?

389
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,334
ANY REASON I SHOULD LEAVE A BLOCK OF TIME OPEN--

390
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,335
SAY, THURSDAY?

391
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,837
I COULDN'T DO IT.

392
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,838
YOU COULDN'T DO IT?

393
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,339
RELAX. I JUST NEED MORE TIME.

394
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,841
WE'RE GOING TO DINNER TONIGHT.

395
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,843
WHAT? YOU'RE GOING OUT WITH HER AGAIN?

396
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,344
GOING OUT WITH WHO?

397
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,347
DANA KEYSTONE FROM COLLEGE.

398
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,349
OH, YEAH.

399
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,852
WASN'T SHE...?

400
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,854
NO, THAT WAS DANA KAPLAN.

401
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,857
 OH, YEAH.

402
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,358
JOEY, YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HER.

403
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,359
AW, WHATEVER.

404
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,366
GREAT STORY AGAIN.

405
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,368
THE YARNS THAT YOU WEAVE...

406
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,370
WHOO HOO.

407
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,874
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD GET GOING.

408
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,875
OH, NO, NO.

409
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,877
STAY, STAY, BECAUSE YOU SHOULD...

410
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,878
YOU SHOULD STAY.

411
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,881
WOW.

412
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,382
OH, I AM

413
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,884
REALLY FLATTERED

414
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:49,388
BUT I JUST... I DON'T FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT YOU.

415
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,391
OH, NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT... NO, NO, NO.

416
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,392
I'M SORRY, CHANDLER.

417
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,895
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE SUCH A SWEET GUY

418
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,397
AND I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU.

419
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,398
OH, I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING

420
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,901
I COULD DO TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

421
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,902
NO, NO...

422
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,403
REALLY?

423
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,905
OF COURSE.

424
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,407
WELL, IT JUST HURTS SO BAD.

425
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,408
I, UH...

426
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:10,910
OH, I'M SORRY.

427
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,914
WELL, MAYBE THERE IS ONE THING YOU CAN DO.

428
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,916
WHAT? ANYTHING. ANYTHING.

429
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,417
WELL, I MEAN, THIS IS

430
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,419
JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD NOW.

431
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,421
UM, BUT I HAVE THIS FRIEND--

432
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,923
UH, THIS ACTOR FRIEND--

433
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,427
AND HE WOULD KILL ME IF HE KNEW THAT I WAS DOING THIS.

434
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,428
UM, BUT, UM...

435
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:33,933
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO GET AN AUDITION

436
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,934
FOR YOUR MOVIE

437
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,435
SAY, ON THURSDAY?

438
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,937
ABSOLUTELY.

439
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,939
BUT YOU'D REALLY FEEL BETTER

440
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,442
ABOUT ME REJECTING YOU IF YOUR ACTOR FRIEND

441
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,945
CAN AUDITION FOR MY MOVIE?

442
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,946
THE HEART WANTS WHAT IT WANTS.

443
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,947
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

444
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,957
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

445
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,960
WELL, NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED IN THE LAST FIVE MINUTES.

446
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,961
YES, IT HAS.

447
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,462
I MADE COOKIES.

448
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,964
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

449
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,465
I'M STILL FULL FROM YOUR HOMEMADE POTATO CHIPS.

450
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,968
BUT YOU SHOULD EAT THEM NOW

451
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,971
BECAUSE THEY'RE HOT FROM THE OVEN.

452
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,472
OKAY.

453
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,473
OH, BUT NOT IN HERE.

454
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,976
YOU CAN'T EAT THEM IN BED, REMEMBER?

455
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:17,977
NO CRUMBIES.

456
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,478
OKAY.

457
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,480
I'LL BE OUT IN A SECOND.

458
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,482
OKAY.

459
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,991
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

460
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,993
THIS DOESN'T LOCK, DOES IT?

461
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,500
OH, JOEY, I'M SORRY.

462
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,002
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

463
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,503
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

464
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,504
NO, BUT LOOK.

465
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,506
OH, THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE A STAIN.

466
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,507
RACH, HEY, IT'S FINE.

467
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,510
YOU'RE AT JOEY'S.

468
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,511
REALLY?

469
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,512
YEAH.

470
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,513
LOOK.

471
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,520
I'VE NEVER LIVED LIKE THIS BEFORE.

472
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,522
I KNOW.

473
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,028
WELL, DON'T WASTE IT. IT'S STILL FOOD.

474
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,530
GEEZ.

475
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,536
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO NOW, HUH?

476
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,038
YOU WANT TO GO GET A DRINK?

477
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,039
UH, I CAN'T.

478
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,040
YOU HAVE

479
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,041
SOME STUDYING TO DO?

480
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,044
NO, I HAVE SOME TURNING 21 TO DO.

481
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,547
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE

482
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,049
WE USED TO...

483
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,053
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

484
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,554
NOTHING.

485
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,557
I'M JUST... I'M SO COMFORTABLE WITH YOU.

486
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,562
DO YOU NOT WANT TO BE SEEN WITH ME?

487
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,563
OF COURSE, I DO.

488
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,065
ARE THEY GONE?

489
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,067
UH, NO, THEY'RE STILL HERE

490
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,069
BUT I THINK I'M ABOUT TO LEAVE.

491
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,570
WHAT?

492
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,072
NO, NO, WAIT.

493
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,073
YOU'RE RIGHT.

494
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,074
THIS IS STUPID.

495
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,076
WHO CARES WHAT PEOPLE THINK?

496
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,578
I MEAN, WE LIKE EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

497
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,081
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

498
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,582
COME ON.

499
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,086
BURT.

500
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,088
LYDIA.

501
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,589
MEL.

502
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,092
THIS IS ELIZABETH.

503
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,593
HI.

504
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,595
AREN'T YOU IN MY POPULAR CULTURE CLASS?

505
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,097
 THAT'S RIGHT, LYDIA.

506
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,099
ELIZABETH HERE IS A STUDENT

507
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,101
AND, UH, WE'RE DATING.

508
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,602
AND YOU MAY FROWN UPON THAT

509
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,605
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO HIDE IT ANYMORE.

510
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,110
YOU ARE SO FIRED.

511
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,612
WHAT?

512
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,114
THEY'RE GOING TO FIRE YOU.

513
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,115
YOU CAN'T DATE A STUDENT.

514
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,616
IT'S AGAINST THE RULES.

515
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,617
REALLY?

516
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,619
IT'S NOT JUST FROWNED UPON?

517
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,626
I LOVE IT AT JOEY'S!

518
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,628
HERE YOU GO.

519
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,131
NICE.

520
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,632
 THANKS.

00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,633
SO, YOU BUSY THURSDAY?

OH, VERY FUNNY.

523
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,136
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER

524
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,638
BUT MY AUDITION WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THURSDAY.

525
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,144
YOU GOT ME THE AUDITION?

526
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,145
LET'S HUG IT UP!

527
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,647
OKAY. OKAY.

528
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,648
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO ME

529
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,649
IF YOU GET THE PART?

530
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,152
HEY.

531
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,153
HEY.

532
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,654
LISTEN, UM...

533
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,156
YEAH, OKAY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

534
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,657
NOW, I KNOW THAT THEY SAID

535
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,659
THAT THE, UM, THE HAIR STRAIGHTENER

536
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,660
STARTED THE FIRE

537
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,162
BUT I THINK I'M PARTLY AT FAULT.

538
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,663
YOU SEE, I DIDN'T TELL YOU

539
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,165
BUT, UM, BUT, UH...

540
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,167
I HAD RECENTLY REFILLED THE TISSUES.

541
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,170
AND, SO, LET'S FACE IT, THAT'S JUST KINDLING.

542
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,172
SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S BETTER

543
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,673
THAT I STAY AT JOEY'S.

544
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,674
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

545
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,176
PHOEBE, THIS WAS MY FAULT.

546
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,178
AND BESIDES, YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M FINE HERE.

547
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,679
OKAY.

548
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,181
CHANDLER, MONICA IS LOOKING FOR YOU.

549
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,682
REALLY?

550
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,684
YEAH. SHE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT CRUMBIES.

551
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,186
NO, NO, NO. I WAS SO CAREFUL.

552
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,190
OKAY, YOU HAVE TO SWITCH WITH ME.

553
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,691
MONICA IS DRIVING ME CRAZY.

554
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:53,692
 THAT'S RIGHT.

555
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,194
ALL THE LADIES

556
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,196
WANT TO STAY AT JOEY'S.

557
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,198
NO, NO.

558
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,699
PHOEBE, I DON'T WANT TO SWITCH.

559
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,201
PLEASE, COME ON.

560
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,702
I CAN THROW WET PAPER TOWELS HERE.

561
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,705
NO, BUT AT MONICA'S, YOU CAN EAT COOKIES

562
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,706
OVER THE SINK.

563
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,208
I KNOW.

564
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,710
I'M SORRY.

565
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,713
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

566
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,215
THIS LOOKS LIKE SO MUCH FUN.

567
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,216
YEAH.

568
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,218
GOD, WHAT A MESS.

569
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,727
WOW. IT ACTUALLY IS IN THE HANDBOOK.

570
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:34,233
I CAN'T DATE YOU OR HAVE A HOT PLATE IN MY OFFICE.

571
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,734
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE

572
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,737
WE HAVE TO STOP SEEING EACH OTHER.

573
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,239
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH

574
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:44,243
I DID APPRECIATE YOU STANDING UP FOR ME.

575
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,245
IT FELT REALLY NICE.

576
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,747
KIND OF MADE ME LIKE YOU EVEN MORE.

577
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,748
I KNOW, I KNOW.

578
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,750
I REALLY LIKE YOU, TOO.

579
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,751
BUT WE CAN'T DATE.

580
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,753
IT'S AGAINST THE RULES.

581
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,754
IT'S FORBIDDEN.

582
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,257
WOW.

583
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,258
WHAT?

584
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,259
JUST HEARING YOU

585
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,761
DESCRIBE IT AS FORBIDDEN--

586
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,763
IT'S REALLY HOT.

587
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,767
REALLY?

588
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,769
YEAH.

589
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,273
WELL... I I DON'T CARE HOW HOT IT IS--

590
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,275
IT'S.... IT'S WRONG.

591
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,777
STOP IT.

592
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,778
NO, NO.

593
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,779
IT'S WRONG.

594
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,283
IT'S IT'S, IT'S NAUGHTY.

595
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,285
IT'S...

596
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,287
TABOO.

597
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,788
SHUT THE BOOK.

598
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,294
LET'S ALSO GET A HOT PLATE.

599
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,301
HEY. HEY.

600
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,302
SO?

601
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,304
SO...?

602
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,305
IT'S THURSDAY.

603
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,806
HOW WAS THE AUDITION?

604
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,807
MONDAY, ONE DAY...

605
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,808
TUESDAY, TWO DAY...

606
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,809

608
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,811

609
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,314
