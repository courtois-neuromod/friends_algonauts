1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,005
MONICA, WHICH OF ALL OF THIS KITCHEN STUFF

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,006
IS MINE?

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:07,507
THIS BOTTLE OPENER.

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,009
AND...?

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,510
AND IT'S A MAGNET.

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,016
GO ON.

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,517
LOOK AT THAT.

8
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,019
HOW WEIRD IS THAT?

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,521
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE MOVING IN WITH ME

10
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,024
AND YOU HAVE THE ONE THING I DON'T HAVE.

11
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,525
HUH? IT'S LIKE, UH...

12
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,028
IN A WAY YOU, YOU COMPLETE ME.

13
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,029
YOU KNOW?

14
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,032
KITCHEN.

15
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,033
WHAT?

16
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,036
YOU COMPLETE ME KITCHEN, MATEY.

17
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,040
ROSS, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,541
WHAT?

19
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,543
THAT SHE'S GOING TO MOVE IN WITH YOU

20
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,046
AND THEN MAYBE SHE'LL FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU

21
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,048
AND THEN, WHEN SHE FINDS OUT YOU'RE ALREADY MARRIED

22
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,050
OH, SHE'LL JUST BE HAPPY, YOU KNOW?

23
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,052
YOU'RE JUST... YOU'RE VERY SAD.

24
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,555
OH... MY... GOD.

25
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,058
I... I SEE WHAT THIS IS.

26
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,561
YOU ARE IN LOVE  WITH RACHEL.

27
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,562
WHAT?!

28
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,563
OF COURSE.

29
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,065
IT ALL ADDS UP.

30
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,566
I MEAN, YOU'RE OBSESSED WITH HER.

31
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,569
IT'S ALWAYS, "ROSS, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT RACHEL?"

32
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,072
"ROSS, WHY ARE YOU MOVING IN WITH RACHEL?"

33
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,573
"WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO CONFESS

34
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,575
YOUR SECRET MARRIAGE TO RACHEL?"

35
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,576
YOU WANT HER.

36
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,577
NO!

37
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:21,581
UH. OH, SAVED BY THE BELL.

38
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,083
HELLO?

39
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,585
HEY, RACH

40
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,087
AREN'T THESE CANDLE STICKS MINE?

41
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,588
NO, NO, I BOUGHT THOSE.

42
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,090
OH, RIGHT. I FORGOT...

43
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,591
YEAH.

44
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,594
THAT YOU'RE A LIAR.

45
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,595
 NO, NO.

46
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,097
THAT'S GREAT.

47
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,098
I'LL BE THERE MONDAY.

48
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,600
AND THANK  YOU AGAIN. OKAY.

49
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,105
UM, THAT WAS THE HEAD OF THE PALEONTOLOGY DEPARTMENT

50
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:49,609
AT "N"... UH, "Y"... UH, "U."

51
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,613
WOW. UH, WHAT... DID HE... UH, SAY?

52
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,117
WELL, REMEMBER THAT PAPER I HAD PUBLISHED

53
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,119
LAST YEAR ON SEDIMENT FLOW RATE? HUH?

54
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,620
THEY LOVED IT.

55
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,122
WELL, WHO WOULDN'T?

56
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,124
I KNOW.

57
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,128
ANYWAY, THEY ASKED ME TO BE A GUEST LECTURER.

58
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,131
I MEAN, IT'S TEMPORARY, BUT, IF THEY LIKE ME

59
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,133
IT COULD LEAD TO A FULL TIME JOB.

60
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,136
HOW GREAT WOULD THAT LOOK ON THE MAILBOX, HUH?

61
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,137
PROFESSOR GELLER.

62
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,139
YEAH, PROFESSOR AND MRS.

63
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,642
AND MRS.?

64
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,144
UH...

65
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,646
OH, YEAH. YOU KNOW, YOU AND ROSS ARE STILL MARRIED.

66
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,649
WHAT?!

67
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,651
JUST KIDDING.

68
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,655
OH, GOD!

69
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,657
COULD YOU IMAGINE?!

70
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,658
NO!

71
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,661
SAVED YOUR ASS.

80
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,703
HI.

81
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,205
HI.

82
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,206
OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

83
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,208
WELL... YOU KNOW THAT PSYCHIC I SEE?

84
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,709
YEAH.

85
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,213
WELL, SHE TOLD ME THAT I'M GOING TO DIE THIS WEEK, SO I'M KIND OF

86
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,214
BUMMED ABOUT THAT.

87
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,215
WHAT?

88
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,716
YEAH, AND I KNOW

89
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,219
YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT PSYCHIC READINGS

90
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,720
BUT THAT ONE IS PRETTY MUCH

91
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,222
THE WORST ONE YOU CAN GET.

92
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,223
PHOEBE, THAT'S CRAZY.

93
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,225
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE WOULD SAY THAT TO YOU.

94
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,227
YEAH, HONEY, YOU DON'T BELIEVE HER, DO YOU?

95
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,228
I DON'T KNOW.

96
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,230
SHE, YOU KNOW, SAID THAT I'D HAVE TRIPLETS.

97
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,233
BUT SHE ALSO SAID ONE OF THEM WOULD BE BLACK.

98
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,237
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, DID SHE TELL YOU HOW YOU'RE GOING TO GO?

99
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,739
NO, BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T TELL ME I WAS GOING TO DIE

100
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,241
TILL THE VERY END OF THE SESSION

101
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,743
AND I WAS NOT GOING TO WASTE A WHOLE OTHER HOUR THERE.

102
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,246
I MEAN, I'VE ONLY GOT A WEEK LEFT, YOU KNOW?

103
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,248
I'VE REALLY GOT TO START LIVING NOW.

104
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,752
HEY, EVERYONE.

105
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,254
OH, HI.

106
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,756
HEY, UH, WELL, TODAY'S MY FIRST LECTURE

107
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,758
AND I KIND OF WANTED TO TRY IT OUT ON YOU GUYS.

108
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,759
DO YOU MIND?

109
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,264
NO, THAT'D BE GREAT. OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

110
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,265
SURE.

111
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,267
OKAY.

112
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,268

113
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,769

114
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,776
"THERE ARE THREE PRIMARY THEORIES

115
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,279
"CONCERNING SEDIMENT FLOW RATE.

116
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,782

118
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,784
OH, THIS IS IT.

119
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,786
THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO KILL ME.

120
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,290
"SUBCATEGORIES:

00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,292
"THE FIRST OF THESE SUBCATEGORIES...

 UH, ROSS.

123
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:57,297
ARE THERE, UH, ARE THERE NAKED CHICKS ON THAT PIECE OF PAPER?

124
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,800
NO. WHY?

125
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,802
WELL, I JUST NEVER SEEN A GUY STARE SO HARD

126
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,305
AT A PIECE OF PAPER THAT DIDN'T HAVE NAKED CHICKS ON IT.

127
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,307
OH.

128
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,808
OKAY.

129
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,310
OKAY.

130
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,814
"THERE ARE THREE...

00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,316

WHY DON'T YOU OPEN WITH A JOKE?

137

OPEN WITH A JOKE?

138
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,336
IT'S A UNIVERSITY, NOT A COMEDY CLUB.

139
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,837
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.

140
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,339
HOLD THE PHONE.

141
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,341
YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT CHUCKLES UNIVERSITY?

142
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,843
OKAY.

143
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,345
WE'RE KIDDING. COME ON.

144
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,346
ROSS, HEY, YOU KNOW

145
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,847
WHAT MIGHT MAKE IT LESS BORING?

146
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,849
THANK YOU.

147
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,352
SOME, UM, SOME VISUAL AIDS.

148
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,354
OOH OOH! YOU KNOW WHAT'S A GOOD VISUAL AID?

149
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,356
PLEASE DON'T SAY "NAKED CHICKS."

150
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,857
WHY NOT?

151
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,859
YOU KNOW, I DON'T EVEN KNOW

152
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,862
WHY I BOTHER TO EVEN TALK TO YOU GUYS ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW?

153
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,865
I'M JUST GOING TO DO IT ON MY OWN WITH NO NAKED CHICKS.

154
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,868
THAT'S THE WAY I DID IT UNTIL I WAS 19.

155
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,372
ALL RIGHT, 20.

156
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,376
TWENTY THREE.

157
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,882
HI. HEY.

158
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,384
ANY GOOD MAIL?

159
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,885
YES. YOU GOT SOMETHING

160
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,387
FROM THE SCREEN ACTORS GUILD.

161
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,389
OOH. IT'S PROBABLY A RESIDUAL CHECK.

162
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,890
HEY, CAN YOU OPEN IT FOR ME? I GOT A...

163
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,394
"BENEFITS LAPSED."

164
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,895
HMM. THAT'S WEIRD.

165
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,398
I DON'T REMEMBER BEING IN A MOVIE CALLED

166
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,899
"BENEFITS LAPSED."

167
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:40,900
IT'S NOT A CHECK.

168
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,403
THEY'RE SAYING YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE EXPIRED

169
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,406
BECAUSE... YOU DIDN'T WORK ENOUGH LAST YEAR.

170
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,907
LET ME SEE THAT.

171
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,409
ALL RIGHT.

172
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,910
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

173
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,413
THIS SUCKS.

174
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,416
WHEN I HAD INSURANCE, I COULD GET HIT BY A BUS OR...

175
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,418
OR CATCH ON FIRE, YOU KNOW?

176
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,919
AND IT WOULDN'T MATTER.

177
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,921
NOW I GOT TO BE CAREFUL?

178
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,923
I'M SORRY, MAN.

179
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,925
THERE'S NEVER A GOOD TIME TO HAVE TO...

180
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,927
STOP CATCHING ON FIRE.

181
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,431
ALL RIGHT, WELL... I GUESS I GOT TO GO GET A JOB.

182
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,932
I'M GOING TO GO SEE MY AGENT.

183
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,434
OKAY, AND MAKE SURE TO LOOK BOTH WAYS

184
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,935
BEFORE YOU CROSS THE STREET.

185
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,938
MAKE SURE TO LOOK BOTH WAYS

186
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,440
BEFORE YOU CROSS THE STREET.

187
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,947
HEY.

188
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,949
HEY, PHEEBS, YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.

189
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,453
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

190
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,956
OH, IT'S SO EXHAUSTING WAITING FOR DEATH.

191
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,459
OH, BY THE WAY, DO YOU THINK...

192
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,461

193
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,464
PHEEBS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

194
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,466
I WAS PREPARING YOU FOR MY DE...

195
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,468
DIDN'T YOU THINK I WAS DEAD?

196
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,969
DID THAT NOT COME OFF?

197
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,971
NO. YEAH, SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME.

198
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,973
I THOUGHT WE'D LOST YOU FOREVER.

199
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,975
PHEEBS, YOU WANT TO LIE DOWN?

200
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,477
YEAH. THANKS.

201
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,979
AND, LISTEN, CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

202
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,982
CAN YOU JUST, UH, WAKE ME UP IN A COUPLE HOURS--

203
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,484
YOU KNOW, IF YOU CAN?

204
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,489
MONICA...

205
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,993
DID DID YOU TAKE THESE BACK?

206
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,496
NO, NO. I JUST... I LIKED THEM SO MUCH

207
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,998
THAT I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT SOME FOR MYSELF.

208
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,501
OH. YEAH, THEY'RE REALLY GREAT, AREN'T THEY?

209
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,002
I LOVE THEM.

210
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,504
YEAH.

211
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,505
NICE TRY.

212
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,008
HELLO.

213
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,510
HEY. HOW'D THE LECTURE GO?

214
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,512
IT WENT GREAT.

215
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:37,016
AND I DIDN'T NEED ANY JOKES OR NAKED CHICKS EITHER.

216
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,017
WOW. THAT'S GREAT, ROSS.

217
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,019
I'M SORRY WE WEREN'T MORE SUPPORTIVE BEFORE.

218
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,021
I KNEW ALL I HAD TO DO WAS LET

219
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,523
THE MATERIAL SPEAK FOR ITSELF, HUH?

220
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,524
EVERYONE'S ALL, UH

221
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,026
"ROSS, YOU HAVE TO BE FUNNY AND SEXY."

222
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,028
WELL, I PROVED THEM WRONG.

223
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,530
AND NOW

224
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,032
I'M GOING TO PASS THE NEWS ON TO JOEY AND CHANDLER.

225
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,534
THAT YOU'RE NOT FUNNY OR SEXY?

226
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,035
THAT'S RIGHT.

227
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,543
HEY, ESTEL LE, LISTEN...

228
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,545
WELL, WELL, WELL.

229
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,547
JOEY TRIBBIANI.

230
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,549
SO YOU CAME BACK, HUH?

231
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,551
THEY THINK THEY CAN DO BETTER

232
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,555
BUT THEY ALL COME CRAWLING BACK TO ESTELLE.

233
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,058
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

234
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,059
I NEVER LEFT YOU.

235
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,061
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN MY AGENT.

236
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,062
REALLY?

237
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,063
YEAH.

238
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,565
OH, WELL.

239
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,567
NO HARM, NO FOUL.

240
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,068
LOOK, ESTELLE...

241
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,570
YOU GOT TO GET ME SOME WORK.

242
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,071
I LOST MY HEALTH INSURANCE.

243
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,573
ALL RIGHT.

244
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,075
FIRST THING WE GOT TO DO-- DAMAGE CONTROL.

245
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,577
WHY?

246
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,078
WELL, I THINK, UH...

247
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,581
SOMEONE OUT THERE...

248
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,584
MAY HAVE BEEN BAD MOUTHING YOU ALL OVER TOWN.

249
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,087
THAT BASTARD!

250
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,592
WE'RE A LITTLE EARLY.

251
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,594
THE LECTURE DOESN'T END FOR 15 MINUTES.

252
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,095
YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE COULD SNEAK IN AND WATCH.

253
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,597
YEAH, COULD.

254
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,598
OH, HEY, LOOK!

255
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,099
THERE'S SOME KAPPA KAPPA DELTAS!

256
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,601
I WAS A KAPPA.

257
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,604
HEY, SISTERS!

258
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,608
WOW, WE REALLY ARE BITCHES.

259
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,611

260
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,613
RIGHT. SO WHEN RIGBY GOT HIS SAMPLES

261
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,615
BACK FROM THE LABORATORY

262
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,117
HE MADE A STARTLING DISCOVERY.

263
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,624
WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE IGNEOUS WAS, IN FACT, SEDIMENTARY.

264
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:29,128
IMAGINE HIS CONSTERNATION WHEN...

265
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,134
OH, BLOODY 'ELL.

266
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,143
HI.

267
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,645
HEY.

268
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,146
SO ESTELLE

269
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,148
LINED UP A BUNCH OF AUDITIONS FOR ME TOMORROW

270
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,151
AND I'LL HAVE MY HEALTH INSURANCE BACK IN NO TIME.

271
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,654
THAT'S GREAT, BUT...

272
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,156
SHOULDN'T YOU BE ON THE TOILET RIGHT NOW?

273
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,660
WHAT?

274
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,162
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

275
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,163
NOTHING.

276
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,166
WELL, I GOT THIS BLINDING PAIN IN MY STOMACH

277
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,168
WHEN I WAS LIFTING WEIGHTS BEFORE

278
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,670
AND THEN I, UH, PASSED OUT

279
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,172
AND, UH, I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO STAND UP SINCE.

280
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,674

281
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,677
BUT, UH, I DON'T THINK IT'S ANYTHING SERIOUS, YOU KNOW?

282
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,178
THIS SOUNDS LIKE A HERNIA.

283
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,680
YOU HAVE TO... YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR.

284
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,683
NO WAY. OKAY, LOOK, IF I'M GOING TO GO TO THE DOCTOR FOR ANYTHING

285
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,686
IT'S GOING TO BE FOR THIS THING STICKING OUT OF MY STOMACH.

286
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,189

287
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,191
THAT'S A HERNIA.

288
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,194
WHY'D I HAVE TO START WORKING OUT AGAIN?

289
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,196
DAMN YOU 15s!

290
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:43,202
 WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

291
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,704
LOOK, I WAS NERVOUS.

292
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,707
YOU GUYS HAD ME ALL WORRIED I WAS GOING TO BE BORING.

293
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,210
I GOT UP THERE AND THEY WERE ALL, LIKE, STARING AT ME.

294
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,712
I OPENED MY MOUTH

295
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,214
AND THIS BRITISH ACCENT JUST CAME OUT.

296
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,217
YEAH, AND NOT A VERY GOOD ONE.

297
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,220
WILL YOU PLEASE...?

298
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,722
DR. GELLER, KURT RATHMAN.

299
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,724
I'M A PROFESSOR  IN THE PALEONTOLOGY DEPARTMENT HERE.

300
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,727
DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR LECTURE?

301
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:11,230
I'M SORRY, I'VE GOT PLANS WITH MY SISTER.

302
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,232
MONICA GELLER R R R....

303
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,237
RIGHT. WILL YOU EXCUSE US FOR ONE MOMENT?

304
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,238
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

305
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,240
OH, YOU CAN HAVE AN ACCENT, BUT I CAN'T?

306
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,244
TOP O' THE MORNIN' TO YE, LADDIES!

307
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,747
WILL YOU JUST PLEASE STOP?

308
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,249
YES, YES, BOMBAY IS

309
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,752
VERY, VERY NICE THIS TIME OF YEAR.

310
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,261

311
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:47,266

312
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,770
HEY, WILL YOU GRAB ME A CRULLER?

313
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,772

314
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,274
SIT DOWN!

315
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,777
WILL YOU GO TO THE HOSPITAL?

316
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,781
DUDE, HERNIA OPERATIONS COST, LIKE... A LOT, PROBABLY, OKAY?

317
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,784
BESIDES, IT'S GETTING DARKER AND MORE PAINFUL.

318
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,285
THAT MEANS IT'S HEALING.

319
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,788
LOOK, I WILL LOAN YOU THE MONEY.

320
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,792
JUST GO TO THE HOSPITAL, AND LET'S JUST GET THAT THING...

321
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,294
PUSHED BACK IN.

322
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,296
THANK YOU, BUT IT WOULD TAKE ME FOREVER

323
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,298
TO PAY YOU THAT MONEY BACK, AND...

324
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,300
I DON'T WANT THAT HANGING OVER MY HEAD, OKAY?

325
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,302
AND BESIDES, AS SOON AS MY INSURANCE KICKS IN

326
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,805
I CAN GET ALL THE FREE OPERATIONS I WANT, OKAY?

327
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,809
I THINK I'LL PROBABLY START WITH THAT LASER EYE SURGERY THING.

328
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,812
HEY... HEY. HEY...

329
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,313
WHAT'S GOING ON?

330
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,315
WELL, JOEY'S GOT A REALLY BAD HERNIA

331
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,819
BUT IT'S NOTHING THAT A LITTLE LASER EYE SURGERY WON'T FIX.

332
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,320
LOOK, I'M TELLING YOU--

333
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,323
IF I PUT MY HAND ON MY STOMACH RIGHT HERE

334
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,325
IT DOESN'T HURT THAT BAD.

335
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,327
HEY! MAYBE YOU'LL DIE.

336
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,331
CHANDLER, I'M SCARED.

337
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,333
NO, WE CAN  GO TOGETHER!

338
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,335
JUST DON'T WAIT TOO LONG, THOUGH, OKAY?

339
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,838
BECAUSE I'M OUT OF HERE SOMETIME BEFORE FRIDAY.

340
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,340
YEAH, BUT I DON'T WANT TO DIE.

341
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,842
NO, NO, IT'LL BE FUN.

342
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,844
WE CAN COME BACK AND WE CAN HAUNT THESE GUYS.

343
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,846
OOH, WAIT.

344
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,348
COULD I COME BACK AND HAUNT MONICA AND RACHEL

345
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,349
WHEN THEY'RE IN THE SHOWER?

346
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,852
THAT'S MY GIRLFRIEND.

347
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,353
HEY, I'M DEAD!

348
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,360
GIVE ME THEM!

349
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,361
NO! THEY ARE MINE!

350
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,864
YOU STOLE THEM FROM ME! YOU STOLE THEM FROM ME!

351
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,366
GIVE ME THEM! GIVE ME THEM!

352
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,870
YOU JUST WANT TO EACH TAKE ONE?

353
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,874
YEAH, THAT SEEMS FAIR-- WE NEVER USE THEM.

354
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,377
LOOK, I REALLY NEED SOME HELP, OKAY?

355
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,381
WHY, WHY DID I HAVE TO SPEAK IN A BRITISH ACCENT?

356
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,883
WHAT DO I DO?

357
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,885
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU

358
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,386
CALL MUMMY AND DADDY?

359
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,889
I'M SERIOUS! SOMEONE'S GOING TO FIND OUT I'M A FAKE

360
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,891
AND THEN THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO OFFER ME A JOB!

361
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,892
WHY DON'T  YOU PHASE IT OUT?

362
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,393
YEAH, PHASE THE ACCENT OUT--

363
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,895
PEOPLE WILL THINK THAT, YOU'RE, YOU KNOW

364
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,396
JUST ADJUSTING TO LIFE IN AMERICA.

365
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,398
 YEAH, I MEAN, COME ON, ROSS--

366
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,399
NO ONE'LL EVEN NOTICE.

367
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,902
I MEAN, THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT EVEN LISTENING TO YOU.

368
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,405
THEY'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME?

369
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,408
OF COURSE THEY'RE LISTENING TO YOU.

370
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,910
EVERYBODY LISTENS TO YOU.

371
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,412
MONICA, UH, YOU REALLY THINK I SHOULD TRY

372
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,914
THIS "PHASING OUT" THING?

373
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,916
I THINK YOU LOOK FINE.

374
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,420
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

375
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,922
OKAY.

376
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,923

377
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,425
HEY, TIMMY...

378
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,927
I'VE GOT A...

379
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,429
SURPRISE... FOR YOU.

380
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,931
HOLD IT, I'M SORRY.

381
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,933
THE SURPRISE IS A NEW SWING SET.

382
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,435
IF YOU COULD PLAY IT A LITTLE LESS INTENSE?

383
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,437
YEAH, SURE. NO PROBLEM.

384
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,940
UH, JUST HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

385
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,442

386
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,448
HEY, TIMMY...

387
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,952
I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

388
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,453
OH, MY GOD!

389
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,963
...SO THAT'S WHY I FEED MY DOG PURINA ONE.

390
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,465
PICK UP A BAG TODAY.

391
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,468
THAT'S WHERE YOU PICK UP THE BAG.

392
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,470
EXACTLY.

393
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,975
NO, THE LINE IS "PICK UP A BAG," SO YOU NEED TO PICK UP THE BAG.

394
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,976
OR...

395
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,978
I COULD JUST POINT TO IT, HUH?

396
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,480
"BLAH BLAH BLAH, PURINA ONE.

397
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,484
POINT TO A BAG TODAY."

398
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,488
I DIDN'T GET IT, DID I?

399
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:29,989
NO.

400
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,491
YEAH, OKAY.

401
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,997
HI. I'M, UH, JOEY TRIBBIANI.

402
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,999
I'M HERE TO AUDITION FOR "MAN."

403
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,500

404
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,002
YOU MEAN "DYING MAN"?

405
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,504
YES!

406
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,008
OKAY, COME ON-- DO IT ONE MORE TIME.

407
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,009
REALLY? REALLY?

408
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,011
YES! OKAY.

409
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,013
HELLO, ROSS?

410
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:58,017
THIS IS DR. McNEELY FROM THE FAKE ACCENT UNIVERSITY.

411
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,520
WE'D LIKE YOU TO COME ONBOARD WITH US FULL TIME.

412
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,022

413
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,524
HEY!

414
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,026
HEY!

415
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,527
LISTEN TO THIS--

416
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,529
MY READING WAS WRONG; I'M NOT GOING TO DIE.

417
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,531
REALLY? HOW DO YOU KNOW?

418
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,033
BECAUSE MY PSYCHIC IS DEAD.

419
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,537
SHE MUST HAVE READ THE CARDS WRONG.

420
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,039
OH... WELL, I'M SORRY.

421
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,541
EH, BETTER HER THAN ME.

422
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,043
HEY, LET'S BAKE COOKIES!

423
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,551
LISTEN, I'M REALLY GLAD YOU GOT THE PART.

424
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,053

425
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,555
BUT ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN DO THIS?

426
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,059
YEAH! AND, HEY, MAN, THANKS FOR COMING WITH ME.

427
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,062
AND THANKS AGAIN FOR HELPING ME TAKE A SHOWER.

428
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:48,567
NOW, IS THAT "NEVER TALKING ABOUT IT AGAIN"?

429
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,568
HIYA.

430
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,570
HEY, JOEY, WE'RE READY FOR YOU.

431
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,571
UH, JOEY, THIS IS ALEX.

432
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,074
HE'S GOING TO BE PLAYING YOUR SON.

433
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,575
HI, ALEX.

434
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:00,579
AND, UH, AS YOU CAN SEE, MY HANDS-- NOT IN MY PANTS.

435
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,081
OKAY...

436
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:06,585
ALL RIGHT, UH, ALEX, NOW, WHEN JOEY SAYS HIS LINE

437
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,088
"TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOUR MAMA, SON"--

438
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,589
THAT'S YOUR CUE TO CRY.

439
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,590
GOT IT?

440
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,592
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS.

441
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,099
SCENE FIVE, TAKE ONE.

442
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,101
AND... ACTION!

443
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,603
TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOUR MAMA, SON.

444
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,114
TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOUR MAMA, SON.

445
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,119
COME ON, SON...

446
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,122
YOUR MAMA'S GOOD PEOPLE.

447
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,123
CUT!

448
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,125
ALEX, REMEMBER...

449
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,126
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CRY.

450
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,128
CAN YOU CRY FOR  US THIS TIME?

451
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,130
OKAY.

452
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,132
ALL RIGHT, FROM THE TOP.

453
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,636
SCENE FIVE, TAKE TWO.

454
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,639
TAKE 36 IS UP.

455
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,641
 ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.

456
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,143
ARE YOU READY, JOE?

457
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,644
UH, ONE THING--

458
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,646
IS IT ALL RIGHT WITH YOU IF I... IF I SCREAM

459
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,148
RIGHT UP UNTIL YOU SAY "ACTION"?

460
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,649
UH, SURE.

461
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,652

462
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,653
ACTION!

463
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,156
TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOUR MAMA, SON.

464
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,159
CUT!

465
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,660

466
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,162
I'M SORRY.

467
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,164
HEY, HEY, JOE, WHY DON'T YOU LIFT UP YOUR SHIRT?

468
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,167
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS, KIDDO.

469
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,669

470
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,671
WE HAVE HIM CRYING, JOHN!

471
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,673
ROLL THE DAMN CAMERAS!

472
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,675

473
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,178

474
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,179
HELLO?

475
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,680
HELLO, IS ROSS THERE?

476
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,681
UH, NO, HE'S NOT.

477
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,682
CAN I TAKE A MESSAGE?

478
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,684
Yes. This is Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer.

479
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,187
JUST TELL HIM THAT SINCE I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM

480
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,189
I ASSUME HE'S DECIDED TO GIVE THE MARRIAGE A TRY.

481
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,690
ROSS GOT MARRIED AGAIN?

482
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,691

483
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,694
NO!

484
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,696
ALL RIGHT, KEEP GOING.

485
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:01,200
WE ARE PHASING THE ACCENT OUT-- PHASING IT OUT.

486
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,705
SO WITHOUT RETESTING THE RESULTS IN THE LABORATORY

487
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:10,209
THE TEAM WOULD NEVER HAVE I DENTIFIED...

488
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,714
THE INITIAL ERRORS IN THEIR...

489
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,718
CARBON DATING ANAL YSIS.

490
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,222
WERE THERE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT?

491
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:24,723
YES?

492
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,725
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOUR ACCENT?

493
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,229
COME AGAIN.

494
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,731
WHAT'S WHAT'S THIS NONSENSE?

495
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,732

496
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:39,238
ALL RIGHT, I'M I'M NOT ENGLISH.

497
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,740
I'M FROM LONG ISLAND.

498
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:46,745
I WAS REALLY NERVOUS, AND THE ACCENT JUST, UH...

499
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,247
JUST CAME OUT.

500
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,250
I'M SORRY.

501
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,255
SO, IF WE COULD JUST GET BACK TO THE LECTURE.

502
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,758
UM... WERE THERE ANY QUESTIONS?

503
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,762
ABOUT PALEONTOLOGY?

504
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,268
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I WAS JUST TRYING

505
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,270
TO MAKE A GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION.

506
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,771
OBVIOUSLY, I SCREWED UP.

507
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,274
BUT WHAT YOU GUYS THINK OF ME IS REALLY IMPORTANT

508
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,276
BECAUSE I'M I'M HOPING TO GET A PERMANENT JOB HERE.

509
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,279
SO IF YOU JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE

510
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,281
TO MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION...

511
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,284
ROSS! ARE YOU CRAZY?!

512
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,285
I AM STILL YOUR WIFE?!

513
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,287
WHAT, WERE YOU JUST NEVER GOING TO TELL ME?!

514
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,289
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?!!

515
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,792
OH! I COULD JUST KILL YOU!

516
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:40,299
WELL, 'ELLO, RACHEL!

517
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,808
YOU'VE REALLY DONE THIS BEFORE?

518
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,809
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

519
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,812
YOU JUST TAKE A BIG, BIG SWING, OKAY?

520
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,314
NOW, DON'T HOLD BACK.

521
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,316
OKAY.

522
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,318
HEY!

523
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,819
HEY!

524
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,321
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

525
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,822
WE'RE JUST CELEBRATING

526
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,824
THAT JOEY GOT HIS HEALTH INSURANCE BACK.

527
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,826
OH, ALL RIGHT.

528
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,333

529
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,335
 SEE? NOW LET'S TRY ONE WITHOUT THE HELMET.
