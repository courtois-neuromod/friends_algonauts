1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,004
HEY.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,505
HEY. SO, UH, DID EVERYTHING GO OKAY

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,007
WITH THE ANNULMENT?

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,009
OH, YEAH, NO PROBLEMS. IT'S ALL TAKEN CARE OF.

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,510
ROSS, THANK YOU. AAH...

6
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,513
HEY, YOU GUYS WANT TO GO SEE A MOVIE?

7
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,015
OH, YEAH. WHY NOT?

8
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,516
I'M GOING TO GET MY SWEATER.

9
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,518
OKAY.

10
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,521
YOU WANT... YOU WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING WEIRD?

11
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,023
ALWAYS.

12
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
I DIDN'T GET THE ANNULMENT.

13
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,029
WHAT?

14
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,531
WE'RE STILL MARRIED.

15
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,532
DON'T TELL RACHEL.

16
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,534
SEE YOU LATER.

17
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,039
HEY, DO YOU HAVE ANY GUM?

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,041
OH, YEAH.

19
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,042
WAIT! WAIT!

20
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,544
HI. LISTEN, ROSS, CAN I JUST TALK TO YOU

21
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,046
FOR JUST A SECOND?

22
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,547
OH, BUT, PHOEBE, WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE FOR THE MOVIE.

23
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,548
OH, THERE'S A CAB!

24
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,549
TAXI!

25
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,052
OH, THAT'S LUCKY, HUH?

26
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,053
GOOD TIMING.

27
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,554
MY GOD, HUH... THERE YOU GO.

28
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,056
WE'RE ACTUALLY JUST GOING TO WALK

29
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,058
BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT UP THERE AT THE ANGELIKA.

30
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,060
OH. THE ANGELIKA! GO! GO!

31
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,064
YOU DIDN'T GET THE ANNULMENT?!

32
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,565
I KNOW.

33
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,067
ROSS...

34
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,068
WELL, I TRIED

35
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,070
BUT WHEN I GOT TO MY LAWYER'S OFF ICE

36
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,072
ALL I COULD HEAR WAS, "THREE DIVORCES!"

37
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,573
"THREE DIVORCES!"

38
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,575
YES, IN THAT HIGH VOICE.

39
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,079
LOOK, I JUST DON'T WANT MY TOMBSTONE

40
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,581
TO READ "ROSS GELLER, THREE DIVORCES."

41
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,083
DON'T BE WORRIED ABOUT THAT.

42
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,086
YOUR TOMBSTONE CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT IT TO SAY.

43
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,588
IT CAN SAY "ROSS GELLER, GOOD AT MARRIAGE."

44
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,589
YOU KNOW?

45
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,593
MINE'S GOING TO SAY, "PHOEBE BUFFAY, BURIED ALIVE."

46
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,597
LOOK, ALL I KNOW IS I CAN'T HAVE ANOTHER FAILED MARRIAGE.

47
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,099
SO, OKAY, WHAT?

48
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,101
YOU'RE GOING TO BE MARRIED TO A GIRL

49
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,602
WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT.

50
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,604
WOMAN! SORRY.

51
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:48,108
WELL, OKAY, SO I DON'T HAVE IT ALL WORKED OUT QUITE YET.

52
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,111
JUST DON'T, DON'T SAY ANYTHING TO RACHEL, PLEASE.

53
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,613
RACHEL IS ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS.

54
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,616
ALTHOUGH, BEING THE ONLY ONE THAT KNOWS ABOUT THIS

55
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,118
DOES MAKE ME FEEL SPECIAL.

56
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,119
OKAY.

57
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,623
OKAY, STOP, STOP, STOP!

58
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,624
PHOEBE!

59
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,127
HEY, RACH!

60
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,129
WHAT WAS THAT?!

61
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,630
SORRY. MIX UP.

62
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,133
HEY, HOW WAS THE MOVIE?

63
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,634
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET.

64
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,136
ROSS.

65
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,137
THEN YOU BETTER HURRY.

66
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,138
THE ANGELIKA! GO! GO!

67
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,140
WHAT?! NO!

77
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,683
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE MOVE IN TOGETHER

78
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,185
CAN I GET A GUM BALL MACHINE?

79
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,686
OF COURSE.

80
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,188
JOEY WOULDN'T LET YOU HAVE ONE?

81
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,191
NO. WHEN IT COMES TO SWEETS, HE'S SURPRISINGLY STRICT.

82
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,193
HEY, HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT A  WAY

83
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,694
TO TELL HIM YOU'RE MOVING OUT?

84
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,197
NO, NO. I KEEP TRYING, YOU KNOW, AND I CAN GET OUT

85
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,198
"JOEY, I HAVE TO..."

86
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,699
BUT THEN I LOSE MY NERVE

87
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,702
AND I ALWAYS FINISH WITH "GO TO THE BATHROOM."

88
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,704
HE MAY THINK I'M SICK.

89
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,206
YOU KNOW, I REALLY HAVE TO TELL RACHEL

90
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,208
BUT I... WE JUST GOT TO GET IT OVER WITH.

91
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,210
YOU KNOW WHAT? THE NEXT TIME WE SEE THEM

92
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,712
WE'RE JUST GOING TO TELL THEM, OKAY? THAT'S IT.

93
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,214
OH, IS THAT HOW THIS IS GOING TO WORK NOW?

94
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,715
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO ORDER ME AROUND ALL THE TIME?

95
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,217
PRETTY MUCH.

96
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,219
ALL RIGHT.

97
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,220
HEY, MONICA. HI.

98
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,721
HEY, MAN, YOU FEELING BETTER?

99
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,723
YEAH, I'M FINE.

100
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,727
UM, JOEY

101
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,229
WE HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

102
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,730
OH, MY GOD!

103
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,733
YOU'RE PREGNANT!

104
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,236
NO.

105
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,237
NO.

106
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,238
NO.

107
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,239
NO!

108
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,241
JOE LOOK,

109
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,242
HERE'S THE THING.

110
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,743
UM...

111
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,747
MONICA AND I HAVE DECIDED TO LIVE TOGETHER HERE

112
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,251
SO... I'M GOING TO BE MOVING OUT, MAN.

113
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,256
WOW.

114
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,757
WELL, UH, HEY...

115
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,759
I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS.

116
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,261
CONGRATULATIONS.

117
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,262
SEE YOU LATER.

118
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,763
HEY, JOEY, JOEY.

119
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,764
ARE YOU OKAY?

120
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,266
YEAH. I GOT TO GO.

121
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,267
I'VE GOT AN ACTING JOB.

122
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,271
LIKE YOU'D BELIEVE THAT.

123
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,274
THIS SUCKS.

124
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,275
LOOK, I'M JUST GOING

125
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,277
TO BE RIGHT ACROSS THE HALL.

126
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,279
AND I PROMISE YOU, THE MINUTE MONICA AND I BREAK UP

127
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,281
I'M MOVING RIGHT BACK IN WITH YOU.

128
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,783
MAYBE THAT'S NOW.

129
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,285
OKAY, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

130
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,287
UH, IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE MOVING IN WITH HIM

131
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,289
I FEEL THAT IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY

132
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,790
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT HIM, OKAY?

133
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,792
HE'S A TERRIBLE ROOMMATE.

134
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,794
TERRIBLE. HE, UH, FORGETS TO, UM...

135
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,296
UH... ALWAYS...

136
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,298
HE ALWAYS, UH...

00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,299
OH, WHO AM I KIDDING?

00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,301
HE'S THE BEST ROOMMATE EVER!

139
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,807

143
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,315
YEAH. I'M READING

PHEEBS, HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN RACHEL?

146
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,320

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,821
I HAVE PRETTY EXCITING NEWS.

148
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,323
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

149
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,825
NO!

150
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,329
CHANDLER AND I ARE MOVING IN TOGETHER.

151
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,330
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

152
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,332
WELL, BUT NOW, IF YOU WERE PREGNANT

153
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,833
WHAT WOULD YOU NAME IT?

154
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,834
HINT: PHOEBE.

00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,843
CHANDLER AND I ARE MOVING IN TOGETHER.

160
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,845
OH, MY GOD.

161
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:50,350
OH, MY LITTLE SISTER AND MY BEST FRIEND

162
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,852

00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,366
PEOPLE MOVING IN, PEOPLE GETTING ANNULLED.

169
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,871
ANYWAY, I GOT TO GO FIND RACHEL, BUT, UM, IF YOU GUYS SEE HER

170
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,874
WOULD YOU PLEASE TRY TO GIVE HER SOME REALLY BAD NEWS

171
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,376
SO MINE DOESN'T SEEM SO BAD.

172
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,377
OKAY, THANK YOU. OKAY. BYE.

173
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,381
HMM, SOMETHING BAD TO TELL RACHEL?

174
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,883
BAD NEWS FOR RACHEL.

175
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,885
WHAT COULD THAT BE?

176
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,387
CAN YOU JUST...?

177
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,888
CAN YOU JUST LAY OFF, PLEASE?

178
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,391
ALL RIGHT? MY LIFE IS AN EMBARRASSMENT.

179
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,893
I SHOULD JUST GO LIVE UNDER SOMEBODY'S STAIRS.

180
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,895
ROSS, IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

181
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,897
SO, YOU'LL HAVE BEEN DIVORCED THREE TIMES.

182
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,399
YOU'LL STILL HAVE A LIFE.

183
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,400
YOU'LL GO ON DATES.

184
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,901
NO. NO. NO, I WON'T.

185
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,404
I'LL BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DATING BARREL NOW.

186
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,407
THE ONLY GUYS BELOW ME WILL BE FOUR DIVORCE GUY

187
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,911
UH, MURDERER GUY AND... AND GEOLOGISTS.

188
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,415
ROSS, YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS, OKAY?

189
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,417
YOU ARE CUTE AND SMART AND SWEET

190
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,920
AND THAT IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THREE STUPID DIVORCES.

191
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,922
OH, YEAH? HAVE YOU EVER DATED ANYONE

192
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,424
WHO'S BEEN DIVORCED THREE TIMES?

193
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,925
THAT'S NOT REALLY FAIR, YOU KNOW.

194
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,928
MOST GUYS WHO'VE BEEN DIVORCED THREE TIMES ARE, LIKE, 60.

195
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,432
YOU'RE YOUNG.

196
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,433
THAT'S TRUE.

197
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,435
I... I AM YOUNG.

198
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,936
WELL...

199
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,940
ROSS, NOBODY CARES ABOUT THIS EXCEPT YOU.

200
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,943
YOU... THIS EMBARRASSMENT THING IS ALL IN YOUR HEAD.

201
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,945
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU.

202
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,946
COME HERE.

203
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:27,947
WHAT?

204
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,450
HI. HI. LISTEN.

205
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,952
MY FRIEND ROSS IS ABOUT TO BE DIVORCED FOR THE THIRD TIME

206
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,454
BUT WOULDN'T YOU DATE HIM?

207
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,956
AND IF YOU WAIT RIGHT HERE

208
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,958
I'LL GO GET ROSS.

209
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,462

210
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,463
HI.

211
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,964
OH... I THOUGHT YOU WERE RACHEL.

212
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:45,965
WHAT GAVE ME AWAY?

213
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,467
I JUST GOT TO TELL HER.

214
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,968
I HAVE TO GET IT OVER WITH.

215
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,471
I'VE TOLD ROSS AND PHOEBE, AND SHE'S THE ONLY ONE LEFT.

216
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,972
OKAY, THAT'S IT-- SO EVERYBODY KNOWS.

217
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,974
IT'S OFFICIAL: WE'RE MOVING IN TOGETHER.

218
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,476
NO TURNING BACK.

219
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,977
ARE YOU SCARED? ARE YOU?

220
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,979
NO.

221
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,482
WOW, THAT WAS MY SCARIEST VOICE. YOU'RE VERY BRAVE.

222
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,483
AAH...

223
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,985
HEY.

224
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,986
HEY. OH...

225
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,488
THE WORST DAY.

226
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,491
YOU KNOW, YOU THINK YOU'RE FINALLY MAKING PROGRESS AT WORK

227
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,493
AND THEN YOUR BOSS CALLS YOU RAQUEL.

228
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,496
HEY, LISTEN, FOR THE FIRST FOUR YEARS OF MY WORK

229
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,498
EVERYBODY CALLED ME CHA LA LA...

230
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,505
SERIOUSLY.

231
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,006
I BELIEVE YOU.

232
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,509
SO, IT WAS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A STAFF MEETING

233
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,512
SO, OF COURSE, NO ONE ELSE WANTS TO CORRECT HER

234
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,514
SO EVERYONE ELSE IS CALLING ME RAQUEL.

235
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,015
BY THE END OF THE DAY

236
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,518
THE MAILROOM GUYS WERE CALLING ME ROCKY.

237
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,020
WELL, I STILL THINK

238
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,023
YOU'RE VERY, VERY NICE AND VERY PRETTY.

239
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,525
WHAT?

240
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,028
ALL YOURS, BABE.

241
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,029
RACHEL...

242
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,532
SWEETIE, HAVE A SEAT.

243
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,034
OKAY, LISTEN, UM...

244
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,036
CHANDLER AND I

245
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,038
ARE GOING TO LIVE TOGETHER.

246
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,040
HERE.

247
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,545
OH, MY GOD.

248
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,548
THAT'S SO GREAT!

249
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,049
OH!

250
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,052
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS!

251
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,053
REALLY?

252
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,556
OH, AND THAT WAS SO SWEET OF YOU TO ASK.

253
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,057
OH, MY GOD!

254
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,559
THE THREE OF US ARE GOING TO HAVE

255
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,561
SUCH A GOOD TIME LIVING TOGETHER!

256
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,563
YES, WE ARE.

257
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,565
AND CHANDLER

258
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,067
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WATCH THOSE LONG SHOWERS

259
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,068
YOU TAKE IN THE MORNING

260
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,070
BECAUSE YOU KNOW RAQUEL CAN'T BE LATE.

261
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,572
RACH.

262
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,073
YEAH, HE'S GOING TO WORK ON THAT.

263
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,575
OH...

264
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,076
OH, THIS IS SO EXCITING.

265
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,079
OH, WOW.

266
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,083

267
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,587

?? WE'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU... ?

268
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,596
SEE, ONCE YOU KNOW THE STORIES, IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

269
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,098
FIRST MARRIAGE, WIFE'S HIDDEN SEXUALITY--

270
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,600
NOT MY FAULT.

271
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,602
SECOND MARRIAGE

272
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,104
SAID THE WRONG NAME AT THE ALTAR...

273
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,606
A LITTLE MY FAULT.

274
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,108
THIRD MARRIAGE--

275
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,610
WELL, THEY REALLY SHOULDN'T ALLOW YOU

276
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,612
TO GET MARRIED WHEN YOU'RE THAT DRUNK

277
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,615
AND HAVE WRITING ALL OVER YOUR FACE-- NEVADA'S FAULT.

278
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,117
OKAY, SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, LADIES?

279
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,619
WHO WOULDN'T BE INTERESTED?

280
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,120
WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO DATE HIM?

281
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,622
WELL, THE DIVORCES DON'T BOTHER ME.

282
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,124
I'D DATE HIM, BUT NOT WHILE HE'S STILL MARRIED.

283
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,627
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT YOU? WOULDN'T YOU WANT A DATE?

284
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,128
ACTUALLY, I'M  NOT DATING AT ALL.

285
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,130
SEE, I FIGURED OUT THAT I WAS ONLY DATING GUYS

286
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,131
THAT WERE, YOU KNOW, LIKE, BAD FOR ME.

287
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,133
SO I DECIDED THAT, UNTIL I COULD WORK THAT OUT...

288
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,635
GOOD, GOOD. WHATEVER.

289
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,637
WHAT ABOUT YOU, MEG?

290
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,140
WELL, I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE DIVORCES EITHER

291
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,643
BUT I WOULDN'T DATE HIM.

292
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,645
NORMALLY, HE DOESN'T SWEAT THIS MUCH.

293
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,647
IT'S JUST

294
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,651
THAT HE'S OBVIOUSLY STILL IN LOVE WITH THIS RACHEL GIRL.

295
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,652
WHAT?

296
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,153
SHE SAID

297
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,656
"HE'S OBVIOUSLY STILL IN LOVE WITH THIS RACHEL GIRL."

298
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,160
THIS IS CRAZY.

299
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,163
I MEAN, YES, YES, RACHEL IS MY GOOD FRIEND

300
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,165
AND I HAVE LOVED HER IN THE PAST

301
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,167
BUT NOW SHE IS JUST MY WIFE.

302
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,672
PHOEBE, WILL YOU HELP ME OUT HERE?

303
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,175
WELL, I THOUGHT YOU LOVED HER WHEN YOU MARRIED HER.

304
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,176
WE WERE DRUNK.

305
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,178
I WOULD HAVE MARRIED, UH, JOEY

306
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,680
WITH THAT AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL.

307
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,183
HEY! YOU COULD DO A LOT WORSE THAN JOEY TRIBBIANI.

308
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,188
I'M SORRY, BUT YOU GUYS ARE WRONG.

309
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,191
I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE DIVORCED THREE TIMES.

310
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,194
YES, AND NOW HE'S USING THIS THREE DIVORCES REASON

311
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,196
BECAUSE HE WANTS TO STAY MARRIED TO HER

312
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,197
BECAUSE HE LOVES HER.

313
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,699
I MUST SAY, WELL DONE.

314
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,700
BRAVO, MEG.

315
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,703
OKAY, FINE, FINE.

316
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,705
IF THIS WHAT YOU THINK, FORGET

317
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,207
ABOUT THE WHOLE THREE DIVORCE THING, OKAY?

318
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,209
I'LL GO TO MY LAWYER'S OFFICE RIGHT NOW

319
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,211
AND GET THIS MARRIAGE ANNULLED, OKAY?

320
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,213
SHE MEANS NOTHING TO ME.

321
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,214
NOTH... NOTHING!

322
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,218
OKAY, NOW I WOULDN'T DATE YOU

323
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,721
BECAUSE YOU SEEM A LITTLE CREEPY.

324
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,223
I AM SO ATTRACTED TO HIM RIGHT NOW.

325
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,731
OKAY, WHEN ARE WE GOING TO TELL RACHEL

326
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,232
WHAT ACTUALLY IS GOING TO HAPPEN?

327
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,734
SOON. I JUST COULDN'T BEFORE.

328
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,736
I MEAN, YOU SAW HOW UPSET JOEY GOT.

329
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,238
I COULDN'T DO THAT TO HER; SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

330
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,740
WELL, JOEY'S MY BEST FRIEND.

331
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,742
I'M NOT YOUR BEST FRIEND?

332
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,246
YOU JUST SAID...!

333
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,248
OF COURSE, YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

334
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,750
WOULD YOU PLEASE

335
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,251
TELL RACHEL, THOUGH?

336
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,754
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, AT LEAST I'M PREPARED.

337
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,755
OKAY.

338
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,758
OH, YES. HEY!

339
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,760
HEY, HEY. THESE AREN'T FOR YOU.

340
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,261
ARE YOU UPSET?

341
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,262
I AM NOW.

342
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,767
HEY, ROOMIE.

00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,775

346
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,778
THERE'S SOMETHING, UH, IMPORTANT I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

347
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,779
ARE YOU PREGNANT?

348
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,282
NO, BUT I'M THROWING THIS SHIRT AWAY.

349
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,785
I THINK THERE WAS A LITTLE

350
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,286
UH, MISUNDERSTANDING BEFORE.

351
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,791
UM, WHEN I SAID THAT, UH, THAT CHANDLER AND I WANTED

352
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,293

353
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,296
WE MEANT ALONE TOGETHER.

354
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,800

355
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,802
OH. OH, MY GOD. OH, THAT'S FUNNY.

356
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,303
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THAT.

357
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,304
OH, NO, SWEETIE.

358
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,806
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

359
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,307
THIS IS MY FAULT.

360
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,308
I WASN'T CLEAR.

361
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,810
I'M REALLY SORRY.

362
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,812
AND AND LISTEN.

363
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,815
YOU TAKE AS MUCH TIME AS YOU NEED TO MOVE OUT, OKAY?

364
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,817
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO RUSH.

365
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,819
OKAY.

366
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,323
OKAY.

367
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,328
DON'T YOU WANT A COOKIE?

368
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,830
SURE.

369
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,835
MAYBE DO YOU NEED A TISSUE?

370
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,336
MM HMM.

371
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,841
MONICA, WHERE DID YOU GET THESE?

372
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,341
I MADE THEM.

373
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,843
OH...

374
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,345
GOD, THEY'RE SO YUMMY.

375
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,348
OKAY, WHOSE IS THIS?

376
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,349
UH... IT'S MINE.

377
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,351
WHAT ABOUT THIS? WHOSE IS THIS?

378
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,353
THAT'S MINE.

379
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,856
OKAY, WHOSE DISHWASHING SOAP IS THIS?

380
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,358
THAT WAS HERE WHEN WE MOVED IN.

381
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,863
HMM. I GUESS IT REALLY IS CONCENTRATED.

382
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,365
GOD, IT'S GOING TO BE WEIRD

383
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,367
LIKE, WHEN I COME HOME

384
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,370
AND YOU'RE NOT HERE, YOU KNOW?

385
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,372
NO MORE JOEY AND CHAN'S.

386
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,373
NO MORE J AND C'S.

387
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,376
WANT TO GO OVER TO JOEY AND CHANDLER'S?

388
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,378
CAN'T. IT'S NOT THERE.

389
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,881
LOOK, I'M JUST GOING TO BE ACROSS THE HALL.

390
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,883
WE CAN STILL DO ALL THE SAME STUFF.

391
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,384
YEAH, BUT WE WON'T BE ABLE

392
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,886
TO, LIKE, GET UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

393
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,888
AND HAVE THOSE LONG TALKS ABOUT OUR FEELINGS

394
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,889
AND THE FUTURE.

395
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,390
NOT ONCE DID WE DO THAT.

396
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,393
DON'T YOU REMEMBER THAT NIGHT?

397
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,396
IT WAS LATE, AND I WAS FEELING SICK

398
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,900
AND YOU SAID I WOULD FEEL BETTER TOMORROW.

399
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,402
OH, YEAH.

400
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,904
I DON'T KNOW, I'M JUST...

401
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,907
I'M JUST GOING TO MISS LIVING WITH YOU.

402
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,408
ME, TOO, MAN.

403
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,911
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

404
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,913
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

405
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,414
HI.

406
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,415
HEY. HEY.

407
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,918
SO, I TOLD RACHEL THAT IT'S JUST GOING

408
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,419
TO BE THE TWO OF US.

409
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,420
OH, YEAH?

410
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,922
WELL, HOW'D SHE TAKE IT?

411
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,924
REALLY WELL, YEAH.

412
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,926
SURPRISINGLY WELL.

413
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,928
SHE DIDN'T CRY.

414
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,431
SHE WASN'T ANGRY OR SAD.

415
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,432
AND YOU'RE UPSET

416
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,936
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T MAKE YOUR BEST FRIEND CRY?

417
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,939
I MEAN, ALL I'M ASKING FOR IS JUST A LITTLE EMOTION.

418
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,441
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK AFTER SIX YEARS?

419
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,444
WHAT? ARE RACHEL AND I NOT AS CLOSE AS YOU GUYS?

420
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,947
I MEAN, DO WE NOT HAVE AS MUCH FUN?

421
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,949
DON'T I DESERVE A FEW TEARS?

422
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,952
WHEN WE TOLD JOEY, HE CRIED HIS EYES OUT.

423
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,455
HEY! I DID NOT CRY MY EYES OUT!

424
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,456
COME ON.

425
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,959
IT'S LIKE THE  END OF AN ERA.

426
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,961
NO MORE J- MAN AND CHANNY'S.

427
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,964
OKAY, I GOT TO ASK.

428
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,465
WHO CALLS US THAT?

429
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,974
YOU GOT MARRIED AGAIN?

430
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,476
YES.

431
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:21,480
SO THAT'S YOUR SECOND MARRIAGE IN TWO YEARS.

432
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,483
YES. SECOND IN TWO YEARS.

433
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,987
THIRD OVERALL.

434
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,989
ROSS, I HAVE BEEN A DIVORCE ATTORNEY

435
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,991
FOR 23 YEARS AND NEVER HAVE I HAD

436
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,492
SO MUCH BUSINESS FROM ONE CLIENT.

437
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,998
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

438
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:43,002
BASICALLY, RACHEL AND I WERE IN VEGAS, AND WE GOT DRUNK...

439
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,503
I'M SORRY.

440
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,506
IS THIS THE SAME RACHEL WHOSE NAME YOU SAID AT THE ALTAR

441
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,008
IN THE SECOND MARRIAGE?

442
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,509
YES, YES, YES!

443
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,012
BUT I DO NOT LOVE HER.

444
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:57,516
OH. THAT'S BETTER THEN.

445
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,020
THIS WAS JUST A DRUNKEN MISTAKE, AND I NEED TO GET IT ANNULLED.

446
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,021
I SEE.

447
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:06,025
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THERAPY?

448
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:11,030
I THINK JUST THE ANNULMENT FOR TODAY.

449
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,032
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF FORMS TO FILL OUT.

450
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,034
EASY.

451
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,036
AND WE'LL NEED TO HAVE WITNESSES WHO CAN TESTIFY

452
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,038
THAT YOU WERE NOT OF SOUND MIND.

453
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,539
NO PROBLEM.

454
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,043
AND WE'LL NEED YOU AND RACHEL TO TESTIFY BEFORE A JUDGE.

455
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,045
OOH.

456
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,049
THERE'S NO WAY TO DO THIS WITHOUT HER?

457
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:34,053
BECAUSE I KIND OF ALREADY TOLD HER IT WAS TAKEN CARE OF.

458
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,055
OF COURSE YOU DID.

459
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,058
LOOK, ROSS.

460
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,559
YOU CAN'T GET AN ANNULMENT

461
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,561
UNLESS YOU AND RACHEL ARE BOTH THERE.

462
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,562
UH HUH.

463
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,566
WHAT ABOUT SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE RACHEL?

464
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,070
I WILL THINK ABOUT THE THERAPY.

465
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,077
HEY. HEY.

466
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,578
SO, UM, I WAS THINKING

467
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,580
THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD START

468
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,082
DIVIDING UP OUR STUFF.

469
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,584
OKAY.

470
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,586
YOU KNOW, NO POINT IN DRAGGING IT OUT.

471
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,090
DRAGGING OUT THE LONG PROCESS OF YOU MOVING OUT

472
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,592
AND US NOT LIVING TOGETHER ANYMORE.

473
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,095
OKAY.

474
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,096
OKAY.

475
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,598
HEY, RACH.

476
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,599
YEAH?

477
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,600
WHAT ABOUT THIS?

478
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,601
WHO GETS THIS?

479
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,603
SEE, I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT IT

480
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,106
BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE TOO MANY MEMORIES.

481
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,608
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

482
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,609
I DON'T KNOW.

483
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,612
HEY, RACHEL

484
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,114
HOW ABOUT THE BIG PLATE?

485
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,615
I WANT YOU TO HAVE THE BIG PLATE.

486
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,118
WOW, MONICA. THANKS.

487
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,120
I LOVE THIS PLATE.

488
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,124
SOMETHING TO REMEMBER ME BY.

489
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,126
MON, HONEY, YOU'RE NOT DYING.

490
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,127
I'M JUST MOVING OUT.

491
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:52,631
WE'RE GOING TO SEE EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME.

492
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,634
BUT STILL, IT'S A BIG CHANGE.

493
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,638
THE END OF AN ERA, YOU MIGHT SAY.

494
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,639
ARE YOU OKAY?

495
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,142
YOU'RE NOT BLINKING.

496
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,143
I'M FINE!

497
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:08,647
I WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW IT'S THE END OF AN ERA.

498
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,150
OH, ALL RIGHT.

499
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,152
BUT, YOU KNOW, I GOT TO SAY

500
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,655
I DON'T THINK SIX YEARS COUNTS AS AN ERA.

501
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,658
AND ERA IS DEFINED AS A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME.

502
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,660
IT WAS SIGNIFICANT FOR ME.

503
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,162
MAYBE IT WASN'T SIGNIFICANT TO YOU!

504
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,663
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

505
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,665
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?!

506
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,668
WHY AREN'T YOU MORE UPSET?!

507
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,170
AREN'T YOU GOING TO BE SAD

508
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,172
THAT WE'RE NOT LIVING TOGETHER ANYMORE?

509
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,174
AREN'T YOU GOING TO MISS ME AT ALL?

510
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,176
MON... ALL RIGHT.

511
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,678
BUT DON'T GET MAD AT ME.

512
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,681
IT'S JUST A LITTLE HARD TO BELIEVE.

513
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,184
WHAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE?

514
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,186
WELL, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, IT'S YOU GUYS.

515
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,188
YOU DO THIS KIND OF STUFF, YOU KNOW?

516
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,690
I MEAN, YOU WERE GOING TO GET MARRIED IN VEGAS

517
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,691
AND THEN YOU BACKED OUT.

518
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,193
I GUESS I'M NOT UPSET

519
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,196
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE YOU ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH WITH IT.

520
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,697
I'M SORRY.

521
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,701
RACHEL...

522
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,704
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

523
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,207
CHANDLER IS GOING TO MOVE IN HERE.

524
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,708
BUT...

525
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,210
I KNOW. JUST LET ME FINISH, OKAY?

526
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,711
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING

527
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,715
THAT WE JUST IMPULSIVELY DECIDED TO DO IN VEGAS.

528
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,717
THIS IS SOMETHING WE BOTH REALLY WANT.

529
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,222
AND IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

530
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,725
IT IS?

531
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,727
REALLY?

532
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,729
YES, SWEETIE.

533
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,232
YOU MEAN WE'RE...

534
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,735
NOT GOING TO LIVE TOGETHER ANYMORE?

535
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,238
NO.

536
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,740
WHA...?

537
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,742
OH, MY GOD!

538
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,743
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU SO MUCH!

539
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,245
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU!

540
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,746
OH.

541
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,748
I MEAN, IT'S THE END OF AN ERA!

542
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,750
I KNOW!

543
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,255
 OKAY, BYE.

544
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,257
OH, NO.

545
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,759
SO, DID YOU GET THE ANNULMENT?

546
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,760
I COULDN'T.

547
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,761
I KNEW IT.

548
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,762
BECAUSE YOU LOVE RACHEL.

549
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,264
IT'S NOT THAT, OKAY?

550
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,766
ANNULMENTS ARE MORE COMPLICATED THAN I...

551
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,268
YEAH, COMPLICATED BECAUSE OF THE LOVE.

552
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,769
I DO NOT LOVE RACHEL.

553
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,274
I'M GOING TO TELL HER RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE WHOLE THING

554
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,276
SO WE CAN GET THIS MARRIAGE ANNULLED

555
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,278
AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, OKAY?

556
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,280
WOULD I DO THAT IF I LOVED HER?

557
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,283
I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE CONVINCED OF YOUR LOVE FOR HER.

558
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,787
I DO NOT HAVE FEELINGS FOR RACHEL, OKAY?

559
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,793
OH, WHAT'S WRONG?

560
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,296
MONICA AND CHANDLER ARE REALLY MOVING IN HERE

561
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,299
AND I HAVE TO MOVE OUT, AND EVERYTHING IS CHANGING.

562
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,300
OH, MY...

563
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,801
COME HERE. COME HERE.

564
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:43,802
IT'S OKAY.

565
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,305
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

566
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,806
THANK YOU.

567
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,808
OF COURSE.

568
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,311

569
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,888
SO, ROSS AND RACHEL GOT MARRIED.

570
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:06,325
MONICA AND CHANDLER ALMOST GOT MARRIED.

571
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,327
YOU THINK YOU AND  I SHOULD HOOK UP?

572
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,330
OH, WE DO.

573
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,332
BUT NOT JUST YET.

574
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,334
REALLY?

575
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,835
WELL, WHEN?

576
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,337
OKAY, UM, WELL

577
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,841
FIRST CHANDLER AND MONICA WILL GET MARRIED

578
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,843
AND BE FILTHY RICH, BY THE WAY

579
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,845
BUT IT WON'T WORK OUT.

580
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,346
WOW.

581
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,348
I KNOW.

582
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,351
THEN I'M GOING TO MARRY CHANDLER FOR THE MONEY

583
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:36,355
AND YOU'LL MARRY RACHEL AND HAVE THE BEAUTIFUL KIDS.

584
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,357
GREAT.

585
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,859
BUT THEN WE DITCH THOSE TWO, AND THAT'S WHEN WE GET MARRIED.

586
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,861
WE'LL HAVE CHANDLER'S MONEY

587
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,363
AND RACHEL'S KIDS--

588
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,365
AND GETTING CUSTODY WILL BE EASY

589
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,867
BECAUSE OF RACHEL'S DRINKING PROBLEM.

590
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,869
OH OH. WHAT ABOUT ROSS?

591
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,871
I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO THE WHOLE THING

592
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,873
BUT, UM, WE HAVE WORDS, AND I KILL HIM.
