1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,505
OKAY...

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,506

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,508
NOW, LISTEN, I'M GOING TO BE MOVING OUT

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,511
SO YOU ARE GOING TO BE IN CHARGE OF PAYING THE RENT.

5
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,512
RIGHT, AND WHEN IS

6
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,513
THAT DUE?

7
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,014
FIRST OF THE MONTH.

8
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,016
AND THAT'S EVERY MONTH?

9
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,518
NO, JUST THE MONTHS YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO LIVE HERE.

10
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,020
AH...

11
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,023
OKAY, HERE'S THE PHONE BILL.

12
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,525
OH, MY GOD.

13
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,028
THAT'S OUR PHONE NUMBER.

14
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,529
NOW, LOOK, I KNOW

15
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,031
I KIND OF SPRUNG THIS WHOLE

16
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,533
"ME MOVING OUT ON YOU" THING, SO WHY DON'T I JUST...

17
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,535
WHY DON'T I JUST COVER YOU FOR A WHILE?

18
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,536
NO, NO, NO WAY.

19
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:40,540
JOEY TRIBBIANI DOES NOT TAKE CHARITY...

20
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,542
ANYMORE.

21
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,544
IT'S NOT CHARITY, JOE.

22
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,046
NO. FORGET IT, OKAY?

23
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,047
I MEAN, THANKS, BUT I'M DONE

24
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,548
TAKING MONEY FROM YOU, ALL RIGHT?

25
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,549
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

26
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,051
NOW, WHAT'S NEXT? COME ON.

27
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,053
OKAY, UH, HERE'S THE ELECTRIC BILL.

28
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,055
THIS IS HOW MUCH WE PAY FOR ELECTRIC?!

29
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,556
WELL, YEAH.

30
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,058

31
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,564
SO WE'LL DO THE REST OF THE BILLS LATER, THEN?

41
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,104
SO, IS JOEY GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE UP THE APARTMENT?

42
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,605
WELL, I HOPE NOT. I TRIED TO OFFER HIM

43
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,107
SOME MONEY, BUT HE WOULDN'T TAKE IT.

44
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,608
WELL, HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK HE NEEDS?

45
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,610
I FIGURED $1,500 DOLLARS WOULD COVER HIM

46
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,112
FOR A FEW MONTHS, YOU KNOW?

47
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,114
BUT I HAVE TO TRICK HIM INTO TAKING IT

48
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,615
SO I DON'T HURT HIS PRIDE.

49
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,617
YEAH, WELL, WHY DON'T YOU HIRE HIM AS AN ACTOR?

50
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,119
YOU COULD HAVE HIM DRESS UP

51
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,123
AND PUT ON LITTLE SKITS-- JUST WHATEVER YOU WANT.

52
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:08,128
WELL, THAT WOULD HELP THE PRIDE THING.

53
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,129
HEY.

54
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,630
HEY, WOW, YOU LOOK GREAT.

55
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,133
DO YOU WANT TO MOVE IN WITH ME TOMORROW?

56
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,634
OKAY.

57
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,137
OKAY. SO, WHAT DO YOU GIRLS

58
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,138
HAVE PLANNED FOR TONIGHT?

59
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,639
WELL, INSTEAD OF BEING SAD

60
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,641
THAT TONIGHT'S MY LAST THAT NIGHT WITH RACHEL

61
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,643
WE THOUGHT WE'D GO OUT TO DINNER

62
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,645
AND CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT RACHEL'S MOVING IN WITH PHOEBE.

63
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,647
AND ALSO, MY BIRTHDAY.

64
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,149
IT'S NOT YOUR BIRTHDAY.

65
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,650
WHAT A MEAN THING TO SAY.

66
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,654
I WOULD NEVER TELL YOU IT WAS NOT YOUR BIRTHDAY.

67
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,655
HEY. HEY.

68
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,656
 HEY.

69
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,658
SO, YOU GUYS HAVE ANYTHING PLANNED

70
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,660
FOR THE BIG LAST NIGHT?

71
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,162
WELL, INSTEAD OF JUST HANGING OUT

72
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,164
WE FIGURED WE'D DO NOTHING.

73
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,665
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA--

74
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,667
KNICKS SEASON OPENER TONIGHT.

75
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,670
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU GUYS WOULD COME OVER AND WATCH IT.

76
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,671
I DON'T KNOW, ROSS.

77
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,173
NOT IF YOU'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

78
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,175
HOW YOU GAVE UP A CAREER IN BASKETBALL

79
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,176
TO BECOME A PALEONTOLOGIST.

80
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,178
I DID GIVE UP A CAREER IN BASKETBALL

81
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,679
TO BECOME A PALEONTOLOGIST.

82
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,181

83
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,183
PHEEBS, I WAS WONDERING...

84
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,684
YOU'RE NOT DRESSED YET?

85
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,187
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO START HAVING FUN IN 15 MINUTES!

86
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,191
WELL, AND CLEARLY, NOT A MINUTE SOONER.

87
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,693
RACHEL, YOU ARE PACKED, THOUGH, RIGHT?

88
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,695
I MEAN, PLEASE TELL ME THAT YOU'RE PACKED.

89
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,197
OF COURSE I'M PACKED.

90
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,198
MONICA, RELAX.

91
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,200
I JUST WANTED TO ASK PHOEBE HER OPINION

92
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,701
ON WHAT I SHOULD WEAR TONIGHT.

93
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,204
MY GOD, I CANNOT GET A MINUTE OF PEACE AROUND HERE.

94
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,209
OH, MY GOD!

95
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,214
MONICA'S JUST GOING TO KILL YOU.

96
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,715
YEAH, I I KNOW.

97
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,218
WELL, WHAT YOU'RE WEARING IS FINE FOR THAT.

98
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,222
RACHEL, I NEED TO TALK...

99
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,723
YOU'RE NOT PACKED!

100
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,226
YOU'RE NOT PACKED EVEN A LITTLE BIT.

101
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,230
SURPRISE!

102
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,231
WHAT?

103
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,233
DON'T GET MAD, BECAUSE, LOOK

104
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,735
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED-- SO I I STARTED PACKING

105
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,238
AND THEN I REALIZED, "WHAT AM I DOING?

106
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,740
I AM LOUSY AT PACKING," RIGHT?

107
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,742
BUT YOU LOVE PACKING

108
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,746
SO AS A GIFT TO YOU ON OUR LAST NIGHT...

109
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:10,250
TA DA.

110
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,252
I'LL BE COORDINATOR.

111
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,255
OH, MY GOD, I'M SO SORRY-- I DIDN'T GET YOU ANYTHING.

112
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,757
OKAY, LOOK, EVERYBODY HAS TO HELP, OKAY?

113
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,759
PHOEBE, YOU CAN HELP, CAN'T YOU?

114
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,261
I HAVE PLANS.

115
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,762
YOU HAVE PLANS WITH US.

116
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,264
THAT'S... RIGHT.

117
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,765
ALL RIGHT, CHANDLER CAN MAKE BOXES

118
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,767
ROSS CAN WRAP AND JOEY CAN LIFT THINGS.

119
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,270
NOW, PHOEBE, GO TELL THE GUYS THEY HAVE TO HELP OUT.

120
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,271
OKAY. OKAY.

121
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,273
MY GOD, THANK YOU!

122
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,774
HURRY. MONICA'S GOING

123
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,776
TO MAKE YOU PACK -- SHE'S GOT JOBS FOR EVERYONE.

124
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,279
NOW, IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME, BUT SAVE YOURSELVES.

125
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,282
 OKAY, THE MOVERS WILL BE HERE

126
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,783
IN 11 HOURS.

127
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,784
RACHEL HAS NOT PACKED.

128
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,286
NOW, EVERYBODY HAS TO HELP.

129
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,288
CHANDLER, WE'RE GOING TO START...

130
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,789
NO, I I I HAVE PLANS WITH JOEY.

131
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,790
I THOUGHT YOU SAID

132
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,292
YOU WERE GOING TO DO NOTHING.

133
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,294
YES, BUT FOR THE LAST TIME.

134
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,295

135
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,796
OKAY, FINE.

136
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,298
NOW, ROSS...

137
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,799
OH, BUT I I CAN'T DO IT.

138
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,800
WHY NOT?

139
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,302
DON'T YOU HAVE BEN?

140
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,305
BECAUSE... I HAVE BEN.

141
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,307
IT'S ALMOST 8:00. IT'S ALMOST PAST HIS BEDTIME.

142
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,308
WHERE IS HE?

143
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,809
HE'S AT A DINNER PARTY.

144
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,814
IS HE REALLY COMING? BECAUSE I CAN SEE INTO YOUR APARTMENT.

145
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,816
OF COURSE HE IS.

146
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,320
UH, WHAT, YOU THINK I'D JUST USE MY SON AS AS AN EXCUSE?

147
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,822
WHAT KIND OF FATHER DO YOU THINK I AM?

148
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,824
ALL RIGHT, SORRY.

149
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,827
I GOT TO GO MAKE A FAKE BEN.

150
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,333
HERE IT IS--

151
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,336
OUR LAST PIZZAS TOGETHER AS ROOMMATES.

152
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,838
I WISH I'D KNOWN YOU WERE GOING TO DO THAT. I ORDERED CHINESE.

153
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,340
OH, WELL, THAT'S OKAY.

154
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,343
HEY, ACTUALLY, IN A WAY, IT'S KIND OF NICE.

155
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,844
YOU KNOW, OUR LAST DINNER TOGETHER--

156
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,847
ME, BRINGING THE FOOD OF MY ANCESTORS

157
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,849
YOU, THE FOOD OF YOURS.

158
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,353
HUH?

159
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,854

160
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,855
SAY, JOE, I HAD A STRANGE IDEA

161
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,857
FOR WHAT WE COULD DO FOR OUR LAST NIGHT.

162
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,859
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE PLAY A LITTLE FOOSBALL FOR MONEY?

163
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,361
ARE YOU CRAZY?

164
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,364
YOU HAVEN'T BEATEN ME ONCE SINCE MY INJURY PLAGUED '97 SEASON.

165
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,866
IT'D BE EASIER IF YOU JUST GIVE ME YOUR MONEY.

166
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,368
YES, IT WOULD.

167
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,869

168
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,372
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO $50 DOLLARS?

169
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:17,377
I'D SAY TO IT, "$50 DOLLARS, YOU ARE MORE THAN I HAVE."

170
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,379
IF YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WIN, THOUGH

171
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,380
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

172
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,881
OKAY, YOU'RE ON.

173
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,882
OKAY, LET'S PLAY.

174
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,884
THE BIG GAME-- ITALY VERSUS...

175
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,886
CHINA, APPARENTLY.

176
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,390
OH, LOOK...

177
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,892
IT'S THE ROLLERBLADES.

178
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,394
OH, GOD...

179
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,397
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE GOT THESE?

180
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,399
NO.

181
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,902
AW, I GUESS YOU WEREN'T THERE.

182
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,407
YOU GUYS, WE SAID WE WERE GOING TO HAVE FUN.

183
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,408
COME ON, HEY.

184
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,909
REMEMBER THE TIME...?

185
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,411

186
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,916
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

187
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,918
I'M SORRY, PHEEBS.

188
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,421
I GUESS I'M JUST REALLY SAD THAT I'M LEAVING.

189
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,923
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU SO MUCH.

190
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,426
WELL, THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SO SAD, THOUGH, YOU KNOW?

191
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,428
MAYBE INSTEAD OF JUST THINKING ABOUT

192
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,430
HOW MUCH YOU'RE GOING TO MISS EACH OTHER

193
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,932
YOU SHOULD, LIKE, THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS

194
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,434
THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MISS.

195
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,436
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING.

196
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,939
COME ON, THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING.

197
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,940
NOPE.

198
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,442
SHE'S PERFECT.

199
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,443
HMM.

200
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,447
I HAVE ONE.

201
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,950
GREAT. OKAY, YOU CAN GO FIRST.

202
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,454
UH, WELL, I GUESS I'M NOT GOING TO MISS THE FACT...

203
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,957
THAT YOU'RE NEVER ALLOWED TO MOVE THE PHONE PEN.

204
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,462
GOOD. THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

205
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,963
OKAY, MONICA, ANYTHING?

206
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,466
YOU KNOW, DOES RACHEL MOVE THE PHONE PEN?

207
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,969
AW, SOMETIMES...

208
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,971
ALWAYS, ACTUALLY.

209
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,974
OKAY, GOOD. THERE YOU GO.

210
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,975
DOESN'T EVERYONE FEEL BETTER?

211
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,480
IT'S NOT JUST THE PHONE PEN.

212
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,982
I NEVER GET MY MESSAGES.

213
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,984
YOU GET YOUR MESSAGES.

214
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,986
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T THINK IT REALLY COUNTS

215
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,489
IF YOU HAVE TO READ THEM OFF THE BACK OF YOUR HAND

216
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,491
AFTER YOU'VE FALLEN ASLEEP ON THE COUCH.

217
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,992
SO SO, YOU MISSED A MESSAGE FROM WHO?

218
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,495
CHANDLER OR YOUR MOM?

219
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,497
OR CHANDLER?

220
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,499
OR YOUR MOM?

221
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,503
GREAT, IT WORKED.

222
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,004
NO ONE'S SAD.

223
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,008
YES.

224
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,510
I WIN AGAIN.

225
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,512
HA HA, THAT'S, LIKE, 500 BUCKS YOU OWE ME.

226
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,513
WHOO HOO HOO.

227
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,015
YEAH. $500 DOLLARS...

228
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,518
THAT IS A LOT OF ELECTRICITY, HUH?

229
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,019
WHOO HOO HOO.

230
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,022
OOH, I GOT TO BUY SOME FOOD.

231
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,525
OKAY, OKAY, GIVE ME A CHANCE TO WIN MY MONEY BACK, OKAY?

232
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,026
SUDDEN DEATH, ONE GOAL...

233
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,028
$1,000.

234
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,029
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

235
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,030
OH, YES.

236
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,532
OKAY...

237
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,033
GET READY TO OWE ME.

238
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,034
OKAY.

239
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,035
OKAY, HERE WE GO. READY?

240
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,561
NO, NO, NO.

241
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,562
NO, NO, NO.

242
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,566
NO.... ONE CAN BEAT ME.

243
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,066

244
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,570
SEE? NOW, THAT'S WHY

245
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,073
ONLY THE LITTLE FAKE MEN ARE SUPPOSED TO DO THE KICKING.

246
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,578

247
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,579
HELLO?

248
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,080
OH, HI, ROSS.

249
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,582
SEE? OTHER PEOPLE CALL ME.

250
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,585
OOH, YOUR BROTHER-- SCORE.

251
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,588
WHAT'S UP?

252
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,089
Oh, I'm just over here with Ben.

253
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,091
THOUGHT WE'D SAY HI.

254
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,092
OH, PUT HIM ON.

255
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,095
BEN, SAY HI TO AUNT MONICA.

256
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:00,600
OH, I GUESS HE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE TALKING RIGHT NOW.

257
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,102
UH, HE'S SMILING, THOUGH.

258
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,106
OKAY, TALK TO YOU LATER.

259
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:18,117
YOU KNOW, DADDY WAS GOING TO BE A BASKETBALL PLAYER.

260
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,125
I THINK IT WAS BETTER WHEN YOU GUYS WERE SAD.

261
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,627
HEY, OH...

262
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,128
REMEMBER THE ROLLERBLADES?

263
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,129
OH...

264
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,632
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE

265
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,133
I'M NOT GOING TO MISS?

266
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,135
"I'M MONICA. I WASH THE TOILET 17 TIMES A DAY

267
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,137
EVEN IF PEOPLE ARE ON IT."

268
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,641
"HI, I'M RACHEL. IS MY SWEATER TOO TIGHT?

269
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,144
NO? OH, I BETTER WASH IT AND SHRINK IT."

270
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,646
"I'M MONICA.

271
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,148
I DON'T GET PHONE MESSAGES FROM INTERESTING PEOPLE. EVER."

272
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,149
HEY, I CALL HER.

273
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,654
"OH, MY GOD, I LOVE ROSS, I HATE ROSS.

274
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,657
I LOVE ROSS, I HATE ROSS."

275
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,659
"OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T FIND A BOYFRIEND

276
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,161
"SO I GUESS I'LL JUST STUMBLE ACROSS THE HALL

277
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,664
AND SLEEP WITH THE FIRST GUY I FIND IN THERE."

278
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,168
YOU GUYS, COME ON. THIS IS THE LAST NIGHT.

279
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,670
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT

280
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,172
AND SO, FOR THE LAST TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU...

281
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,675
BOO HOO. GET OUT OF MY ROOM!

282
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,682
YEAH, WE SHOULD GET A MOVE ON

283
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,685
IF WE WANT TO MAKE THOSE DINNER RESERVATIONS.

284
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,194
STILL BROKEN?

285
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,697
IT SUCKS, MAN.

286
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,698
IT'S YOUR LAST NIGHT HERE

287
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,700
AND I LOSE THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT THINGS

288
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,202
IN MY LIFE-- THE FOOSBALL TABLE AND...

289
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,204
$500 DOLLARS.

290
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,706
BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE OTHER WAYS

291
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,207
YOU CAN WIN BACK YOUR MONEY.

292
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,209
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE, UH, A LITTLE BLACKJACK?

293
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,210
NAH, NOT MY GAME.

294
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,712
OKAY, UH, HOW ABOUT-- HOW ABOUT...

295
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,213
YOU KNOW, WE COULD PLAY A NEW GAME.

296
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,715
A NEW GAME-- IT'S FUN.

297
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,716
WELL, WHAT'S IT CALLED?

298
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,219
CUPS.

299
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,221
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY CUPS.

300
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,222
I'LL TEACH YOU. COME ON.

301
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,724
IT'S REAL EASY... REALLY, REALLY FUN.

302
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,225
ALL RIGHT.

303
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,227
OKAY, HERE YOU GO.

304
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,228
I HAVE TWO QUEENS.

305
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,229
WHAT DO YOU HAVE?

306
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,731
A TWO AND A FIVE.

307
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,232
HO HO, YOU WIN, $50 DOLLARS.

308
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,235
REALLY?

309
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,737
OH, YEAH. OKAY, LET'S PLAY AGAIN.

310
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,738
READY?

311
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,239

312
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,741
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

313
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,743
FOUR AND A NINE.

314
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,745
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

315
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,747
NO. WHY?

316
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,749
WELL, THAT'S A FULL CUP.

317
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,252
DAMN, I AM GOOD AT CUPS.

318
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,757
I'M NOT TALKING TO HER.

319
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,759
ONE OF YOU HAS TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP

320
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,260
AND IT SHOULD BE YOU

321
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,262
BECAUSE SHE'S THE ONE WHO'S LEAVING.

322
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,764
IT'S HARDER FOR HER.

323
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,766
WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT...

324
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,268
BUT SHE MADE FUN OF MY PHONE PEN!

325
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,269
I KNOW.

326
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,271
I TOOK IT HARD, TOO.

327
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,776
SHE'S IN THERE RIGHT NOW CRYING. I CAN HEAR HER.

328
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,280
SHE'S NOT CRYING.

329
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,282
SHE'S HOLDING IT IN.

330
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,784
SHE'S SO BRAVE. GO.

331
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,790
LISTEN, RACHEL, I FEEL REALLY BAD ABOUT WHAT HA...

332
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,291
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

333
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,793
I'M UNPACKING.

334
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,293
WHAT?!

335
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,795
I'M NOT MOVING.

336
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,797
IS THAT PICTURE STRAIGHT?

337
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,800
IT NEEDS TO GO ABOUT 20 BLOCKS TO THE LEFT.

338
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,802
 HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT-- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WANTS

339
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,804
TO MAKE THIS BIG CHANGE AND MOVE IN WITH CHANDLER.

340
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,306
YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE TO GO;  WHY DO I HAVE TO LEAVE?

341
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,307
BECAUSE IT'S MY APARTMENT.

342
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,809
WELL, IT'S MINE, TOO.

343
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,310
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

344
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,313
HOW ABOUT... YOU'RE MOVING?!

345
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,314
WH...

346
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,315
NO. NO. NO NO-

347
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,817
YES, YES, YES YES YES. NO NO NO NO.

348
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,318
YES. NO NO NO.

349
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,319
YES. NO NO NO.

350
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,821
OKAY, MONICA, WAIT!

351
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,822
COME ON.

352
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,823
COME ON.

353
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,325
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

354
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,328
WE SHOULD BE PACKING YOU!

355
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,830
WH...

356
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,832
 HEY, HOW YOU GUYS DOING?

357
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,833
GREAT.

358
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,834
MONICA'S MOVING.

359
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,336
I AM NOT.

360
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,838
OH, REALLY?

361
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,840
WELL, HOW COME ALL YOUR STUFF IS IN THIS BOX?

362
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,341
OKAY, YOU GUYS, YOU GUYS

363
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,844
I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, HERE, OKAY?

364
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,346
YOU GUYS... STOP!

365
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,849
I KNOW THAT... I KNOW THAT YOU'RE ACTING MAD

366
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,351
BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT'LL MAKE IT EASIER TO LEAVE

367
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,854
BUT DEEP DOWN, YOU'RE STILL REALLY SAD--

368
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,855
DEEP, DEEP DOWN.

369
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,356
NO, PHOEBE, I AM MAD.

370
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,859
WELL, DEEP, DEEP,DEEP DOWN. YEAH, I'M JUST MAD.

371
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,861
THEN, KEEP RUNNING.

372
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,365
YOU WIN.

373
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,366
WELL, WHAT DID YOU HAVE?

374
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,868
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

375
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,370
NOTHING BEATS A. .. THREE AND A SIX.

376
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,873
THAT, MY FRIEND, IS "D" CUP.

377
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,377
OKAY, NOW, HOW MUCH HAVE YOU WON SO FAR?

378
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,879
UH... WOW...

379
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,880
$700 DOLLARS.

380
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,881
NOT $700 DOLLARS EXACTLY!

381
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,382
YEAH.

382
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,884
DOUBLE IT.

383
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,385
WHAT?

384
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,386
YEAH, SEE, IN CUPS

385
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,389
ONCE YOU GET $700 DOLLARS, YOU HAVE TO DOUBLE IT.

386
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,891
REALLY?

387
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,893
HEY, I DIDN'T MAKE UP THE RULES.

388
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,895
NOW OKAY, SO,

389
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,397
AFTER YOU RECEIVE THE DOUBLING BONUS

390
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,899
YOU GET, UH, ONE CARD.

391
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,401
NOW, THAT ONE CARD COULD BE WORTH $100 DOLLARS

392
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,904
WHICH BRINGS YOUR TOTAL TO $1,500 DOLLARS

393
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:05,905
OH HO... NO, WAIT.

394
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,406
DON'T GET TOO EXCITED

395
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,408
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN

396
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,910
UNLESS YOU GET THE... NO WAY!

397
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,915
WELL, THIS IS THE LAST BOX OF YOUR CLOTHES.

398
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,416
I'M JUST GOING TO LABEL IT

399
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,918
"WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?"

400
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,419
HUH, THAT'S SO FUNNY

401
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,421
BECAUSE I WAS JUST GOING TO GO ACROSS THE HALL

402
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,423
AND WRITE THAT ON CHANDLER.

403
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,428
OKAY, YOU GUYS, I DON'T MEAN TO MAKE THINGS WORSE

404
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,431
BUT, UM, I DON'T WANT TO LIVE WITH RACHEL ANYMORE.

405
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,432
WHAT? WHAT?

406
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,934
YOU'RE JUST SO MEAN TO EACH OTHER

407
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,936
AND I DON'T WANT TO END UP LIKE THAT WITH RACHEL.

408
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,437
I STILL LIKE YOU.

409
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,440
WELL, PHOEBE, THAT'S FINE BECAUSE I'M NOT MOVING.

410
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,942
WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA.

411
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,444
PHOEBE, YOU GOT TO TAKE HER.

412
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,446
I KNOW I SAID SOME BAD STUFF ABOUT HER

413
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,448
BUT RACHEL DOES HAVE SOME GOOD QUALITIES

414
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,950
THAT MAKE HER A GOOD ROOMMATE.

415
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,451
OH, REALLY?

416
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,452
LIKE WHAT, MONICA?

417
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,954
OKAY...

418
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,957
YOU KNOW HOW SHE HAS 147,000 PAIR OF BOOTS?

419
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,959
OH, YEAH, GOOD START, MON.

420
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,961
SHE LETS YOU BORROW THEM.

421
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,965
YEAH, AND YOU STRETCH THEM OUT WITH YOUR BIG OLD CLOWN FEET.

422
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,967
DO YOU WANT TO LIVE OUTSIDE?

423
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,469
BECAUSE IT'S GETTING COLD.

424
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,472
SHE GETS TONS OF CATALOGS

425
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,974
AND, UM, SHE'LL FOLD DOWN THE PAGES

426
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,976
OF THE THINGS THAT SHE THINKS THAT I'D LIKE.

427
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,477
WHAT ELSE?

428
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,478
WELL...

429
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,480
WHEN I TAKE A SHOWER...

430
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,483
SHE LEAVES ME LITTLE NOTES ON THE MIRROR.

431
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,484
YEAH, I DO.

432
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,986
I I DO DO THAT.

433
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:27,987
THAT'S NICE.

434
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,990
I LIKE HAVING THINGS TO READ IN THE BATHROOM.

435
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:33,993
WHEN I FALL ASLEEP

436
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,995
ON THE COUCH AFTER READING...

437
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,998
SHE COVERS ME OVER WITH A BLANKET.

438
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,499
WELL, YOU KNOW...

439
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,002
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE COLD.

440
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,006
AND... WHEN I TOLD HER

441
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,509
THAT I WAS GOING TO BE MOVING IN WITH CHANDLER...

442
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,511
SHE WAS REALLY SUPPORTIVE.

443
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,515
YOU WERE SO GREAT.

444
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,517
YOU MADE IT

445
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,519
SO EASY...

446
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,023
AND NOW YOU HAVE TO LEAVE...

447
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,525
AND I HAVE TO LIVE WITH A BOY!

448
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,526
OH...

449
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,527
OH, HONEY...

450
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,029

451
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,532
OH, IT'S GOING TO BE FINE.

452
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,535
OKAY, RACHEL, NOW I CAN'T WAIT TO LIVE WITH YOU.

453
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,037
AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO?

454
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,040
BRING MONICA, AND THEN WE COULD ALL LIVE THERE TOGETHER.

455
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,541
WE'LL HAVE SO MUCH FUN!

456
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,045
BUT, HONEY, I THINK SHE'S MOVING IN WITH CHANDLER.

457
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,047
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

458
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,548
YOU'RE STILL SET ON THAT?

459
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,549

460
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,051
KIND OF.

461
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,059
OH, MY GOD!

462
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,562

463
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,563
HELLO?

464
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,564
HEY, MON.

465
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,066
HOW'S THE PACKING GOING?

466
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,067
BEN? HE'S FINE.

467
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,068
YEAH, HE'S RIGHT...

468
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,570
OH, MY GOD!

469
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,571
WELL...

470
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,074
GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR SHIRT THERE, SON.

471
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,575

472
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,576
WHAT?

473
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,078
YEAH, IT'S A PUMPKIN.

474
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,579
I'LL COME PACK.

475
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,084
HEY.

476
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,085
WHAT'S WRONG?

477
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,086
ROSS AND I

478
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,587
WERE HELPING THE GIRLS PACK

479
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,089
TOOK A LITTLE BREAK...

480
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,591
I LOST $1,500 DOLLARS TO HIM AT CUPS.

481
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,093
WHA...

482
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,096
HOW DID YOU LOSE AT CUPS?

483
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,597
THE SAME WAY YOU LOST.

484
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,100
I STARTED OUT WITH A KING AND A QUEEN.

485
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,102
BAM! ROSS GETS A TWO AND A THREE.

486
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,104
THEN I GET A JACK AND A KING.

487
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,106
BOOM! ROSS GETS A FOUR AND FIVE.

488
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,608
ROSS WAS GETTING THE CUP CARD

489
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,112
TH THE "D" CUP, THE THE SITTING DOWN BONUS...

490
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,615
MEANWHILE, I DIDN'T EVEN GET A HALF A CUP, NOTHING!

491
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,617
OH, MAN!

492
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,119
HE NEVER PLAYED BEFORE EITHER.

493
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,620
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

494
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,123
I THINK BEGINNER'S LUCK-- VERY IMPORTANT IN CUPS.

495
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,125
OKAY, I... LET'S JUST PLAY ONE MORE HAND--

496
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,626
JUST ONE MORE HAND.

497
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,628
NO, NO, NO MORE-- I CANNOT LOSE ANOTHER DIME.

498
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,130
I'M SERIOUS THIS TIME.

499
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,132
I IN FACT, LOOK, THERE'S, UH...

500
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,633
I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING, OKAY?

501
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,137
AND LET ME GIVE IT TO YOU NOW, BEFORE I PAWN IT FOR CUPS MONEY.

502
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,641
NOW... I WANT YOU TO HAVE

503
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,644
THE BIG WHITE DOG AS A... KIND OF A, YOU KNOW

504
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:09,148
LIKE A THANK YOU FOR... BEING SUCH A GREAT ROOMMATE.

505
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,650
I CAN'T TAKE THE BIG WHITE DOG.

506
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,651
YOU LOVE IT.

507
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,654
IT'S "HIM", NOT "IT."

508
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,156
NO, BUT WHAT WHAT IF I BOUGHT IT

509
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,657
FROM YOU, YOU KNOW?

510
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,659
AND, THEN, YOUR YOUR NICE GESTURE WOULD BE

511
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,661
GIVING IT TO ME AT A REASONABLE PRICE--

512
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,163
SAY, $1,500 DOLLARS?

513
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,665
WAIT A SECOND.

514
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,168
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE.

515
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,171
YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING TO GIVE ME MONEY AGAIN.

516
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,673
WHEN DID I TRY TO GIVE YOU MONEY?

517
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,675
BEFORE, OVER THERE, WITH THE BILLS.

518
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,177
YOU TRIED TO GIVE ME CHARITY.

519
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,178
I SAID, "NO."

520
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,179
YOU DROPPED IT.

521
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,681
OKAY, THEN, WE HAD A NICE LAST NIGHT TOGETHER.

522
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,183
WE HAD SOME FUN; WE GAMBLED.

523
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,684
NOBODY TRIED

524
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,686
TO GIVE ANYBODY ANY MONEY.

525
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,689
NOW, OUT OF THE BLUE, YOU START WITH THE CHARITY THING AGAIN.

526
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,691
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU OUT, OKAY?

527
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,693
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE OKAY.

528
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,694
I WILL BE OKAY.

529
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,697
LOOK, CHANDLER, YOU GOT TO GET IT OUT OF YOUR HEAD

530
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,200
THAT I CAN'T TAKE CARE OF MYSELF, OKAY?

531
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,701
LOOK, I'M NOT GOING

532
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,204
TO MISS YOU HELPING ME OUT WITH MONEY.

533
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,207
THE ONLY THING THAT I'M GOING TO MISS...

534
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,209
IS YOU.

535
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,713
AND NOW THE DOG.

536
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,721
HEY...

537
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,223
CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THERE, OKAY?

538
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,224
OKAY.

539
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,226
I'M REALLY GOING TO MISS YOU.

540
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,727

THANKS.

545
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,239
YEAH.

546
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,245
OH, GOD, THIS IS SILLY.

547
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,747
I'M GOING TO SEE YOU IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.

548
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,749

SHE REALLY LEFT.

554
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,286
I KNOW.

555
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,789
THANK YOU.

556
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,791
NO PROBLEM, ROOMIE.

557
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,801
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

558
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,802
SURE.

559
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,805
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT DOG DOING HERE?

560
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,812
I INVENTED CUPS AS A WAY TO GIVE JOEY MONEY.

561
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,814
AND NOW YOU WANT THAT MONEY BACK.

562
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,316
EXACTLY.

563
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,818
CHANDLER, WHAT KIND OF IDIOT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR?

564
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,820
IT'S NOT A REAL GAME.

565
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,322
I MADE IT UP.

566
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,825
I'M SORRY YOU LOST YOUR MONEY, BUT I WON IT FAIR AND SQUARE.

567
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,827
AT A FAKE GAME!

568
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:12,831
NOW, IF YOU WANT TO TRY TO MAKE SOME OF IT BACK...

569
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:16,835
I'D BE GLAD TO PLAY YOU FOR IT, BUT I SHOULD WARN YOU--

570
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,338
I AM VERY GOOD AT CUPS.

571
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,339
OKAY...

572
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,341
NOW, I ASSUME THE SAUCER CARD CAME UP

573
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,842
WHEN YOU PLAYED LAST.

574
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,843
NO.

575
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:25,844
HMM...

576
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,846
LET'S SEE IF IT COMES UP THIS TIME.
