1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,508
HEY, YOU GUYS EVER WONDER WHY THEY CALL IT "THANKSGIVING"?

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,010

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,513
OKAY. HEY, MONICA,

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,016
YOU'RE DOING THANKSGIVING NEXT WEEK, RIGHT?

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,517
BECAUSE, UH, CAROL'S TAKING BEN

6
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,019
TO HER PARENTS' PLACE IN FLORIDA.

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,023
OKAY, OKAY...  I'LL MAKE THANKSGIVING DINNER.

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,524
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BEG.

9
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,026
I I DIDN'T BEG.

10
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,527
I I JUST ASKED ONCE.

11
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,530
YOU COULD BEG, YOU KNOW?

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,532
MONICA SAID I COULD MAKE DESSERT THIS YEAR.

13
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,534
UH, YOU'RE GOING TO COOK SOMETHING?

14
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,535
HEY, I COOK.

15
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,038
OFFERING PEOPLE GUM IS NOT COOKING.

16
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,539
 ARE YOU SURE MONICA SAID

17
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,541
YOU COULD MAKE SOMETHING THIS YEAR?

18
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,543
BECAUSE I REMEMBER HER SAYING, "IN TWO YEARS."

19
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,545
YOU SAID, "IN TWO YEARS," RIGHT?

20
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,547
NO, I... I PROMISED HER

21
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,550
BUT, UH, RACH, ARE YOU SURE YOU DO WANT TO START OUT

22
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,053
WITH SOMETHING AS BIG AS THANKSGIVING DINNER?

23
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,556
I MEAN, MAYBE YOU WANT TO TRY A LITTLE THANKSGIVING BREAKFAST...

24
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,058
MAYBE THANKSGIVING SNACK.

25
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,059
WHAT? HEY, COME ON.

26
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,060
YOU GUYS, I CAN DO THIS.

27
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,562
REMEMBER, I MADE THOSE PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES.

28
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,563
AAH...

29
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,568
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS ARE SO WORRIED ABOUT.

30
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,569
COOKING IS EASY.

31
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,071
YOU JUST FOLLOW THE RECIPE.

32
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,073
IF IT SAYS, "BOIL TWO CUPS OF SALT"

33
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,574
YOU JUST BOIL TWO CUPS OF SALT.

43
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,616
OKAY, GREAT. BYE.

44
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,619
HEY. SO, GUESS WHO'S COMING TO THANKSGIVING DINNER.

45
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,620
SIDNEY POITIER.

46
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,122

47
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,624
I MISS RACHEL.

48
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,626
OH, THAT'S GREAT. NO, MY PARENTS.

49
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,628
THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THE PLACE SINCE I MOVED IN.

50
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,630
YEAH, AND YOU KNOW IF YOU COULD NOT MENTION TO THEM

51
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,632
THAT WE LIVE TOGETHER, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

52
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,634
I WAS THINKING WE'D EAT AROUND 4:00.

53
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,137
WHY CAN'T I TELL THEM THAT WE LIVE TOGETHER?

54
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,139
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WE'RE DATING.

55
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,141
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD EAT IN THE KITCHEN?

56
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,642
WHY HAVEN'T YOU TOLD THEM?

57
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,145
UM, WELL, I WAS GOING TO, I WAS REALLY WAS

58
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,648
BUT, UM, THEN, SOMEWHERE, JUST OUT OF NOWHERE, I DIDN'T.

59
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,650
WHY HAVEN'T YOU TOLD THEM?

60
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,152
WOULDN'T THEY BE HAPPY?

61
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,154
SO DINNER IN THE KITCHEN AROUND 4:00.

62
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,155
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

63
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,657
WHY WOULDN'T THEY BE HAPPY?

64
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,659
WELL, UH, BECAUSE...

65
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,161
MAINLY, UH...

66
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,663
THEY DON'T LIKE YOU.

67
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,665
I'M SORRY.

68
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,167
WHAT? WHAT? WHY?

69
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,669
MAYBE BECAUSE YOU USED TO BE ALOOF, OR THAT YOU'RE

70
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,671
REALLY SARCASTIC, OR THAT, YOU KNOW

71
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,173
YOU JOKE AROUND ALL THE TIME

72
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,674
OR THAT YOU TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES

73
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,176
AND YOU THROW THEM ON THE COUCH.

74
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,678
IS THIS WHY THEY DON'T LIKE ME OR WHY YOU DON'T LIKE ME?

75
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,681
LOOK, I KNOW THAT I SHOULD HAVE TOLD THEM.

76
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,684
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T CARE WHAT THEY THINK. I'M SORRY.

77
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,187
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'LL BE OKAY, IT'LL BE OKAY

78
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,689
BECAUSE WHEN THEY COME OVER, I WILL BE ALL CHARMING.

79
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,691
I WILL MAKE THEM FALL IN LOVE WITH ME

80
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,193
AND THEN WE'LL TELL THEM.

81
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,194
YOU REALLY THINK THAT'LL WORK?

82
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,196
HEY, I CAN BE PRETTY CHARMING, BABE.

83
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,697
WON YOU OVER, DIDN'T I?

84
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,700
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL EVER GET MY PARENTS THAT DRUNK.

85
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,706
HEY. OH, GOOD.

86
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,708
ROSS, YOUR PARENTS LIKE ME, RIGHT?

87
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,211
YES, OF COURSE THEY LIKE YOU.

88
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,213
WELL, MONICA JUST TOLD ME THAT THEY DON'T.

89
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,714
YEAH, THEY DON'T LIKE YOU.

90
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,217
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

91
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,719
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE REALLY SARCASTIC

92
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,221
OR, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE...

93
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,723
WELL, IF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW

94
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,225
THEY SHOULDN'T JUST GUESS.

95
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,726
THIS IS GREAT. ANOTHER THANKSGIVING

96
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,228
WITH NOTHING TO GIVE THANKS FOR.

97
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,731
MAYBE I GIVE THANKS FOR YOU SHUTTING UP, HUH?

98
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,233
MAYBE I GIVE THANKS

99
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,735
BY TAKING MY PLAYSTATION OVER TO MY NEW APARTMENT.

100
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,736
WELL, MAYBE I LOVE YOU.

101
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,738

102
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,739
HI. HI.

103
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,241
HEY, GUYS.

104
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:05,745
NO, I DON'T WANT TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES, JOE.

105
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,251
ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO CHANDLER'S FOR THANKSGIVING?

106
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,252
YEAH, YEAH, WHY? WHAT'S UP?

107
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,753
WELL, ME AND MY DANCER FRIENDS

108
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,255
ARE THINKING OF DOING THANKSGIVING UPTOWN.

109
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,257
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS MIGHT LIKE TO COME.

110
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,759
FOR REAL?

111
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,760
YOU SHOULD GO TO CHANDLER'S

112
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,262
BECAUSE NONE OF US KNOWS HOW TO COOK.

113
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,264
WE'LL PROBABLY JUST END UP DRINKING ALL DAY.

114
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,266
YEAH. WE GO TO YOURS, YEAH.

115
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,768
YEAH. SEE, WE HAVE TO STOP ACROSS THE HALL

116
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,272
BECAUSE IT'S MY SISTER, BUT YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY

117
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,774
GROWING UP WITH A SISTER WAS NICE

118
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,278
BECAUSE IT REALLY HELPED ME UNDERSTAND WOMEN.

119
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,780
YOU SHOULD TELL YOUR FRIENDS THAT.

120
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,782
OKAY.

121
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:50,290
HOW YOU GOT THREE WOMEN TO MARRY YOU, I'LL NEVER KNOW.

122
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,296
HEY, MON, LOOK--

123
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,798
I'M MELTING BUTTER.

124
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,300
THAT'S GREAT, RACH.

125
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,303
YOU NOW HAVE THE COOKING SKILLS OF A HOT DAY.

126
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,306
HEY.

127
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,807
HEY, PHEEBS, CHECK IT OUT.

128
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,309
YEAH. FOR MY DESSERT

129
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,312
I HAVE CHOSEN TO MAKE A TRADITIONAL ENGLISH TRIFLE.

130
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,314
WOW, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

131
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,316
AND WHAT ARE YOU MAKING, MONICA, YOU KNOW

132
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,319
IN CASE RACHEL'S DESSERT IS SO GOOD THAT I EAT ALL OF IT.

133
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,824
THERE'S NONE LEFT FOR ANYBODY ELSE.

134
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,326
NOTHING.

135
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,827
NOTHING?

136
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,330
YEAH, SWEETIE, I TRUST YOU.

137
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,833
SO IF I MESS THIS UP, THERE'S NOTHING ELSE FOR DESSERT?

138
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,336
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MESS IT UP.

139
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,837
WOW, MONICA, I LOVE THAT.

140
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,839
YOU REALLY HAVE FAITH IN ME. THANK YOU.

141
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,341
TECHNICAL QUESTION.

142
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,343
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN THE BUTTER IS DONE?

143
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,846
WELL, IT'S DONE ABOUT TWO MINUTES BEFORE IT LOOKS THAT.

144
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,850
HEY. HEY. HEY.

145
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,353
OH, THE FOOD SMELLS GREAT, MON.

146
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,356
YEAH, AND THE PLACE LOOKS SO NICE.

147
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,857
HEY, HAPPY THANKSGIVING, EVERYBODY.

148
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,359
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

149
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,361
 HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

150
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,862
WELL, THIS HAS BEEN GREAT.

151
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,364
SEE YA.

152
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,365
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

153
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,867
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

154
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,369
OH, WE DID SAY

155
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,872
WE'D STOP BY THIS LITTLE THING JOEY'S ROOMMATE IS HAVING.

156
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,375
OH, JANINE, THE REALLY HOT DANCER GIRL?

157
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,879
SOME WOULD SAY SHE'S ATTRACTIVE, YES.

158
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,881
AND WHO ELSE IS GOING TO BE THERE?

159
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,882
SOME OF HER FRIENDS.

160
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,384
HER DANCER FRIENDS?

161
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,885
YES, ALL RIGHT?

162
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,888
ALL OF HER HOT DANCER FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE THERE

163
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,391
AND THEY'LL BE DRINKING AND DANCING

164
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,393
AND WE REALLY WANT TO GO.

165
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,897
DUDE, WE WERE GOOD.

166
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,899
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO ANYWHERE.

167
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,901
YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO EAT HERE

168
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,403
AND YOU'RE GOING TO EAT HERE.

169
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,405
AND LEAVING US TO GO SEE HOT DANCER GIRLS

170
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,407
IS NOT VERY THANKSGIVING Y.

171
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,908
OH, BUT IT IS.

172
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,410
IT'S JUST LIKE THE FIRST THANKSGIVING

173
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,413
WHEN THE INDIANS AND THE PILGRIMS SAT DOWN TO DINNER.

174
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,416
YEAH, YEAH, AND THEN THE INDIANS TAUGHT THE PILGRIMS

175
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,918
WHAT IT MEANT TO BE HOT IN THE NEW WORLD.

176
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,420
 ALL RIGHT, FELLAS

177
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,922
I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD STAY HERE.

178
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,425
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GO.

179
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,928
THAT IS SO NOT TRUE.

180
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,430

181
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,434
HI. HELLO, EVERYBODY.

182
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,935
HI.

183
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,938
HI, DAD. MOM.

184
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,441
LOOK... LOOK WHO IT IS.

185
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,942
IT'S CHANDLER.

186
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,444
OH, YES, OF COURSE.

187
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,945
HELLO, CHANDLER.

188
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,448
MR. AND MRS. GELLER, YOU LOOK WONDERFUL.

189
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,450
IT IS GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE.

190
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,951
LET US TAKE OFF YOUR COATS.

191
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,954
WHOA, SNOWING OUT THERE?

192
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,956
NO.

193
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,965
MONICA, ALL THIS FOOD LOOKS WONDERFUL.

194
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,468
YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT DOING THIS FOR A LIVING.

195
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,472
OKAY. I HAVE DANDRUFF.

196
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,475
THERE'S NO NEED TO LAUGH AND POINT.

197
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,479
DAD, CHANDLER WAS JUST LAUGHING AT YOUR JOKE.

198
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,481
MY JOKE WASN'T FUNNY.

199
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,483
WELL, CHANDLER LAUGHS AT EVERYTHING.

200
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,985
THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT HIM.

201
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,986
WHOA.

202
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,488

203
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,989
RACH...

204
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,491
YEAH.

205
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,494
I JUST REMEMBERED. I HAD A DREAM ABOUT MR. GELLER LAST NIGHT.

206
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,995
REALLY?

207
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:16,996
YEAH.

208
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,499
I DREAMT THAT HE SAVED ME FROM A BURNING BUILDING

209
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,501
AND HE WAS SO BRAVE AND SO STRONG

210
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,504
AND IT'S MAKING ME LOOK AT HIM TOTALLY DIFFERENTLY.

211
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,506
YOU KNOW?

212
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,508
I MEAN, HE USED TO BE JUST, YOU KNOW

213
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,510
JACK GELLER, MONICA AND ROSS'S DAD

214
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,012
AND NOW HE'S JACK GELLER, DREAM HUNK.

215
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,517
 I DON'T KNOW.

216
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,519
YOU KNOW, TO ME, HE'LL ALWAYS BE JACK GELLER--

217
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,020
WALKS IN WHILE YOU'RE CHANGING.

218
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,026
YOU KNOW, DAD, CHANDLER IS ONE

219
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,028
OF ROSS'S VERY BEST FRIENDS.

220
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,530
YES, I KNOW.

221
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,032
YOU KNOW, ROSS SURE IS A GREAT GUY.

222
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,534
YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS FELT

223
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,538
THAT HOW A YOUNG MAN TURNS OUT IS A REFLECTION ON HIS FATHER.

224
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,540
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT, TOO.

225
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,542
TELL ME, WHAT DOES YOUR FATHER DO?

226
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,546
HE'S A HEADLINER OF A...

227
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,549
GAY BURLESQUE SHOW.

228
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,552
RACH, YOU'RE KILLING US HERE.

229
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,554
WILL YOU SERVE THE DESSERT ALREADY?

230
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,557
THERE'S DRUNKEN DANCERS AWAITING.

231
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,559
WELL, LOOK AT IT. ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

232
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,060
YEAH, YEAH, WHAT IS IT?

233
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,061
IT'S A TRIFLE

234
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,063
AND IT'S GOT ALL OF THESE LAYERS.

235
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,065
FIRST, THERE'S A LAYER OF LADYFINGERS

236
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,567
THEN A LAYER OF JAM

237
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,069
THEN CUSTARD, WHICH I MADE FROM SCRATCH.

238
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,070
THEN RASPBERRIES

239
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,572
MORE LADYFINGERS

240
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,575
THEN BEEF SAUTEED WITH PEAS AND ONIONS

241
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,078
AND THEN A LITTLE BIT MORE CUSTARD, AND THEN BANANAS

242
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,081
AND THEN I JUST PUT SOME WHIPPED CREAM ON TOP.

243
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,589
WHAT WAS THE ONE RIGHT BEFORE BANANAS?

244
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,594
THE BEEF? YEAH, THAT WAS WEIRD TO ME, TOO, BUT, THEN, YOU KNOW

245
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,096
I THOUGHT, WELL, THERE'S MINCEMEAT PIE.

246
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,598
I MEAN, THAT'S AN ENGLISH DESSERT.

247
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,099
THESE PEOPLE JUST PUT

248
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,602
VERY STRANGE THINGS IN THEIR FOOD, YOU KNOW?

249
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,605
OH, BY THE WAY, CAN I BORROW SOME RUM FROM YOUR PLACE?

250
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,106
YEAH, SURE, YEAH.

251
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,609
AND WHILE I'M GONE, DON'T YOU BOYS SNEAK A TASTE.

252
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,111
RIGHT. OKAY.

253
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,615
BEEF IN A DESSERT?

254
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,618
THERE... NO, NO, NO. THERE IS NO WAY.

255
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,622
I KNOW, AND ONLY ONE LAYER OF JAM?

256
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,127
WHAT IS UP WITH THAT?

257
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,629
OH, MY GOD.

258
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,132
THE PAGES ARE STUCK TOGETHER.

259
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,133
CHANDLER!

260
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,141
OH, MY GOD.

261
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,145
SHE... SHE MADE HALF AN ENGLISH TRIFLE AND...

262
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,650
HALF A SHEPHERD'S PIE.

263
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,151
OH, MAN.

264
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,653
NOW SHE'S GOING TO START ALL OVER.

265
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,655
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GET TO INTRODUCE

266
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,156
THE HOT GIRLS TO THE NEW WORLD.

267
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,658
NO, NO, WE WILL.

268
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,660
WE JUST WON'T TELL HER SHE MESSED UP.

269
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,162
JUST LET HER SERVE THE BEEF CUSTARD THING?

270
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,664
YEAH.

271
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,166
IT WILL BE LIKE A FUNNY THANKSGIVING STORY.

272
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,169
VOMITING STORIES ARE FUNNY, I GUESS.

273
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:14,674
JOEY, GOD, YOUR APARTMENT IS, LIKE, A HUNDRED DEGREES.

274
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,176
DID IT MAKE YOU WANT TO WALK AROUND IN YOUR UNDERWEAR?

275
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,178
NO.

276
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,681
STILL NOT HOT ENOUGH.

277
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,185
YEAH. RACHEL.

278
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,186
OKAY. LOOK AT HIM.

279
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,689
LOOK AT THOSE STRONG HANDS.

280
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:34,193
OH, WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE TO BE THAT CAN OF CONDENSED MILK.

281
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,699
MOM, CHANDLER WAS JUST SAYING

282
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,200
HOW BEAUTIFUL YOUR SWEATER IS.

283
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,202
OH, THANK YOU, CHANDLER. I JUST BOUGHT IT.

284
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,705
OH, YES. WELL, IT'S VERY BEAUTIFUL.

285
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,207
IT'S CREAM COLORED AND TIGHT, AND...

286
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,711
I DON'T MEAN TIGHT.

287
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,212
IT'S NOT TOO TIGHT.

288
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,714
NOT THAT I WAS LOOKING AT...

289
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,216
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM?

290
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,219
I THINK HE'S STONED AGAIN.

291
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,220
WHAT?

292
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,722
WHAT?

293
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,223
DUDE, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU A SEC.

294
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,230
OKAY.

295
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,733
I THINK I MIGHT KNOW WHY MY PARENTS DON'T LIKE YOU.

296
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,734
YOU DO? WHY?

297
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,736
OKAY, REMEMBER-- WE WERE YOUNG...

298
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,238
SPRING BREAK, SOPHOMORE YEAR.

299
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,740
I GOT HIGH IN MY BEDROOM

300
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,242
AND MY PARENTS WALKED IN AND SMELLED IT

301
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,744
AND SO I TOLD THEM

302
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,247
THAT YOU HAD GOTTEN STONED AND JUMPED OUT THE WINDOW.

303
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,248
WHAT?

304
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,250
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

305
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,752
I DON'T KNOW.

306
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,254
YOURS WAS THE FIRST NAME THAT POPPED INTO MY HEAD.

307
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,256
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD MATTER.

308
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,758
HOW COULD IT NOT MATTER?

309
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,259
WELL, HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW

310
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,761
WE'D END UP BEING FRIENDS AFTER COLLEGE

311
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,763
LET ALONE YOU'D BE LIVING WITH MY SISTER?

312
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,765
WHAT ABOUT ALL THAT "FRIENDS FOREVER" STUFF?

313
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,266
I DON'T KNOW.

314
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,768
I WAS ALL HIGH.

315
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,275
MOM AND DAD JUST SENT ME IN HERE TO FIND OUT

316
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,277
IF YOU WERE TRYING TO GET ROSS STONED.

317
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,281
YOUR PARENTS CAUGHT ROSS SMOKING POT IN COLLEGE

318
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,282
AND HE BLAMED IT ON ME.

319
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,284
ROSS, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D DO THAT.

320
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,787
THE REASON WE HAVEN'T TOLD THEM WE'RE TOGETHER

321
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,288
IS BECAUSE THEY HATE ME.

322
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,790
OKAY? SO, WILL YOU FIX THIS?

323
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,291
OKAY. OKAY.

324
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,794
I'LL TELL THEM IT WASN'T CHANDLER WHO GOT HIGH.

325
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,796
NOW, WHO SHOULD I SAY IT WAS?

326
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,798
YOU!

327
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,800
IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS A BIG DEAL.

328
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,302
YOU DON'T STILL DO IT OR ANYTHING.

329
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,804
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

330
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,807
NOW, WHO SHOULD I SAY "TRICKED" ME INTO DOING IT?

331
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,308
NOBODY.

332
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,309
YOU'RE GOING TO GO OUT THERE

333
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,811
AND TELL THEM EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

334
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,311
REALLY?

335
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,813
YES.

336
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,814
OKAY.

337
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,815
OKAY, GOOD.

338
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,317
OH, WAIT, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD KNOW?

339
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,318
NO.

340
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,820
OH... YEAH, UM...

341
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,821

342
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,323
YOU MICROWAVED A BUNCH OF MY DAD'S RECORDS.

343
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,324

344
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,826

345
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,828
WHY?

346
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,832
EVIDENTLY, YOU YOU WEREN'T VERY GOOD AT HANDLING YOUR HIGH.

347
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,341
DAD.

348
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,844
DAD, PLEASE DON'T PICK YOUR TEETH OUT HERE.

349
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,346
ALL RIGHT, AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO PUT YOUR FEET UP...

350
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,348
MONICA, LEAVE HIM ALONE!

351
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,852
WILL YOU HURRY UP?!

352
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,353
DID YOU NOT HEAR ME BEFORE

353
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,857
WHEN I TOLD YOU THAT ALL OF JANINE'S FRIENDS ARE DANCERS, HUH?

354
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,359
AND THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DRINKING A LOT?

355
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,864
NO, I DID, BUT TELL ME AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S SO ROMANTIC.

356
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,366
YOU'RE WHIPPING SO SLOW. CAN'T YOU DO IT ANY FASTER?

357
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,869
JOEY, COME ON. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE ANY MISTAKES, ALL RIGHT?

358
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,371
THIS IS THE ONLY DESSERT AND IF I SCREW IT UP

359
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,372
EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE, LIKE

360
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,874
"OH, REMEMBER THAT THANKSGIVING

361
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,375
WHEN RACHEL SCREWED UP THE TRIFLE?"

362
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,378
OKAY?

363
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,381
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET ME WORRY ABOUT MAKING THE TRIFLE

364
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,884
AND YOU JUST WORRY ABOUT EATING IT, ALL RIGHT?

365
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,885
OH, I AM.

366
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,387
ROSS, IF YOU DON'T TELL THEM, THEN I WILL.

367
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,389
OKAY, FINE.

368
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,892
ROSS, CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

369
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,394
OH, UH, CAN'T IT WAIT A SECOND, JOEY?

370
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,396
I HAVE TO TELL MY PARENTS SOMETHING.

371
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,898
NO, IT CAN'T? OKAY.

372
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,404
OKAY, LOOK, I THINK WE HAVE TO TELL RACHEL

373
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,906
SHE MESSED UP HER DESSERT.

374
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,908
WHAT? WHAT IS WITH EVERYBODY?

375
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:13,913
IT'S THANKSGIVING, NOT TRUTH DAY.

376
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,415
LOOK, WHEN EVERYONE EATS THAT BANANA MEAT THING

377
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,417
THEY'RE ALL GOING TO MAKE FUN OF HER.

378
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:19,919
DO YOU WANT THAT?

379
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,921
OKAY, OKAY, WE'LL JUST GET EVERYONE

380
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,923
TO ACT LIKE THEY LIKE IT.

381
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,425
THAT WAY, NO ONE MAKES FUN OF HER

382
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,929
AND WE STILL GET TO  GO TO SWEET POTATO PIE.

383
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,932
DUDE, THEY'RE NOT OBJECTS.

384
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,936
JUST KIDDING. I'LL TALK TO THEM.

385
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,937
YOU DISTRACT HER.

386
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,941
HEY, RACH, CAN I TALK TO YOU OUTSIDE FOR A SEC?

387
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,945
OKAY.

388
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,953
WHAT'S UP, ROSS?

389
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,455
SO, UM...

390
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,958
THANKSGIVING.

391
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,963
THE HOLIDAY SEASON IS UPON US, HMM?

392
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,465
YEAH.

393
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:11,971
AND, UM, YOU LOOK NICE TODAY.

394
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,472
OH, NO.

395
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,974
NO, ROSS. DON'T DO THIS.

396
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,975
WHAT?

397
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,476
I JUST... I DON'T THINK

398
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,479
US GETTING BACK TOGETHER IS A GOOD IDEA.

399
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,982
HUH?

400
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,483
I THOUGHT THIS MIGHT HAPPEN TODAY.

401
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,484
ROSS...

402
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,987
I KNOW THE HOLIDAYS CAN BE ROUGH, YOU KNOW?

403
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,490
AND IT'S PROBABLY REALLY HARD FOR YOU TO BE ALONE RIGHT NOW.

404
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,992
YOU'RE ALONE.

405
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,494
NO, I I LIVE WITH PHOEBE.

406
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:39,498
I MEAN, YOU'RE ALONE ALONE.

407
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,499
YOU KNOW? AND I JUST...

408
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,501
IT'S JUST NOT THE TIME FOR US.

409
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,503
I'M SORRY.

410
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,506
OH, WELL. CAN'T BLAME A GUY FOR TRYING.

411
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,009
SO...

412
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,010

413
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,011
OKAY...

414
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,512
AND, UH, IF ANYONE NEEDS HELP

415
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,014
PRETENDING TO LIKE IT

416
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,016
I LEARNED SOME THINGS IN ACTING CLASS.

417
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,518
TRY RUBBING YOUR STOMACH.

418
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,519
OR, UH...

419
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,022
OR SAYING "MMM."

420
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,025
AND, UH, OOH, OHH-- SMILING.

421
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,526
OKAY.

422
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,029
I'M NOT GOING TO PAY FOR THOSE ACTING CLASSES ANYMORE.

423
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,033
 RACHEL, THERE YOU ARE.

424
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,035
COME ON. LET'S SERVE THAT DESSERT ALREADY.

425
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,537
JOEY, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STOP RUSHING ME.

426
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,539
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU DON'T GET ANY DESSERT.

427
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,541
REALLY?

428
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,542
NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.

429
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,544
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO YOU.

430
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,048
OKAY, EVERYBODY, IT'S TRIFLE TIME.

431
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,549
SO, NOW, RACH...

432
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,552
THIS IS A TRADITIONAL ENGLISH TRIFLE, ISN'T IT?

433
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,054
IT SURE IS.

434
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,056
WOW. SO, THEN, DID YOU MAKE IT WITH BEEF OR EGGPLANT?

435
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,057
BEEF.

436
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,558
I CAN'T HAVE ANY, YOU KNOW?

437
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,060
I DON'T EAT BEEF.

438
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,063

439
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,564
ALL RIGHT, MONICA

440
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,566
I WANT YOU TO HAVE THE FIRST TASTE.

441
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,568
REALLY?

442
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,572
OH, WAIT WAIT!

443
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,574
YOU ONLY GOT WHIPPED CREAM IN THERE.

444
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,076
YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE A BITE

445
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,577
WITH ALL THE LAYERS.

446
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,579
OKAY.

447
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,082
OOPS, YOU DROPPED A PEA.

448
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,592
WELL?

449
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,596
MMM...

450
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,104
IT'S GOOD.

451
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,106
REALLY? HOW GOOD?

452
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,608
IT'S SO GOOD THAT  I FEEL REALLY SELFISH

453
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,610
BEING THE ONLY ONE WHO'S EATING IT.

454
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,613
AND I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE EVERYONE TASTE HOW GOOD IT IS.

455
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,615
ESPECIALLY ROSS.

456
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,121
MM HMM.

457
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,622
 MMM...

458
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,124
YEAH, THIS IS SO GOOD

459
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,127
THAT I'M GOING TO GO ENJOY IT ON THE BALCONY.

460
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:54,133
SO I CAN ENJOY THE VIEW WHILST I ENJOY MY DESSERT.

461
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,636
AND I'M GOING TO CALL MY FRIEND, MARY

462
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,639
AND TELL HER HOW GOOD THIS IS FROM MONICA'S ROOM.

463
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,141
I'LL HELP YOU DIAL.

464
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,645
AND I'M GOING TO GO INTO THE BATHROOM

465
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,648
SO I CAN LOOK AT IT IN THE MIRROR AS I EAT IT.

466
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,651
OKAY, NOW, WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

467
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,653
IS IT... DOES IT NOT TASTE GOOD?

468
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,654
LET ME TRY THAT.

469
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,156
NO! NO!

470
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,162
ALL GONE.

471
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,166
SO GOOD.

472
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,169
MAYBE CHANDLER HAS SOME LEFT.

473
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,174
IT TASTES LIKE FEET.

474
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,677
I LIKE IT.

475
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,183
ARE YOU KIDDING?

476
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,184
WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?

477
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,685
CUSTARD? GOOD.

478
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,686
JAM? GOOD.

479
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,189
MEAT? GOOD!

480
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,694
SO A BIRD JUST GRABBED IT AND THEN...

481
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,200
AND THEN TRIED TO FLY AWAY WITH IT AND...

482
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,203
AND THEN JUST DROPPED IT ON THE STREET?

483
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,706
YES, BUT IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION

484
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,709
BEFORE THE BIRD DROPPED IT, HE SEEMED TO ENJOY IT.

485
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,213
RACHEL, COME HERE.

486
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,714
OKAY...

487
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,217
I WAS JUST STARTING TO TAKE MY THANKSGIVING NAP

488
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,718
AND I HAD ANOTHER DREAM ABOUT JACK.

489
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,221
UH, PHOEBE, DO I WANT TO HEAR THIS?

490
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,222
I DON'T KNOW. LET'S SEE.

491
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,723
SO... OKAY, I DREAMT

492
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,225
THAT WE WERE GOING TO GET MARRIED

493
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,727
AND HE LEFT BECAUSE HE HAD TO GO FIGHT A FIRE.

494
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,230
AND, UM, SO, OKAY, I WENT TO A NIGHTCLUB

495
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,232
AND I SAW HIM MAKING OUT WITH A GIRL.

496
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,233
OH, MY GOD.

497
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,235
HE DREAM CHEATED ON YOU.

498
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,236
YEAH.

499
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,238
BUT THEN JACQUES COUSTEAU CAME

500
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,240
AND HE KICKED HIS  ASS FOR BETRAYING ME.

501
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,741
HE WAS SO COOL.

502
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,243
AND THEN, HE TOOK ME DIVING

503
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,745
AND HE INTRODUCED ME TO HIS PET SEA HORSE

504
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,747
WHO, BY THE WAY, WAS TOTALLY COMING ON TO ME

505
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,250
AND PLEASE, THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

506
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:57,256
BOY, I'M GLAD I WORE THE BIG BELT TODAY.

507
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,757
WOW.

508
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,761
FIVE MINUTES AGO, A LINE LIKE THAT WOULD HAVE FLOORED ME.

509
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,762
NOW NOTHING.

510
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,264
WELL, NOT NOTHING.

511
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,765
I AM STILL A WOMAN.

512
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,270
ROSS...

513
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,271
LET'S GO.

514
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,773
OH, YEAH, ABOUT TELLING MOM AND DAD

515
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,776
I WAS THINKING ABOUT MAYBE WRITING A LETTER.

516
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,278
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S IT.

517
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,279
YOU'VE HAD YOUR CHANCE.

518
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,784
MOM, DAD, ROSS SMOKED POT IN COLLEGE.

519
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,785
WHAT? WHAT?

520
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:30,289
YOU ARE SUCH A TATTLETALE!

521
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,793
MOM, DAD...

522
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,295
YOU REMEMBER THAT...

523
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:40,799
THAT TIME YOU WALKED IN MY ROOM AND SMELLED MARIJUANA?

524
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,800
YES. YES.

525
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:51,810
WELL, I TOLD YOU IT WAS CHANDLER WHO WAS SMOKING THE POT, BUT...

526
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,313
IT WAS ME.

527
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,315
I'M SORRY.

528
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,816
IT WAS YOU?

529
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,318
 YEAH, AND DAD

530
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,320
CHANDLER DIDN'T MELT YOUR RECORDS.

531
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,322
ROSS DID.

532
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:05,824
IS THAT TRUE?

533
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,327
YEP... AND YOU KNOW THAT MAILMAN THAT YOU GOT FIRED?

534
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,329
HE DIDN'T STEAL YOUR PLAYBOYS.

535
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,330
ROSS DID.

536
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,332
OH...

537
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,338
YEAH, WELL, HURRICANE GLOR IA DIDN'T BREAK THE PORCH SWING.

538
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,839
MONICA DID!

539
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,345
ROSS HASN'T WORKED AT THE MUSEUM FOR A YEAR!

540
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,848
MONICA AND CHANDLER ARE LIVING TOGETHER!

541
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:37,856
ROSS MARRIED RACHEL IN VEGAS AND GOT DIVORCED AGAIN!

542
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,360
I LOVE JACQUES COUSTEAU!

543
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:47,366
I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO PUT BEEF IN THE TRIFLE!

544
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,370
I WANT TO GO!

545
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:58,377
THAT'S A LOT OF INFORMATION TO GET IN 30 SECONDS.

546
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,379
ALL RIGHT

547
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,881
JOEY, IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE, JUST LEAVE.

548
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,886
RACHEL, NO, YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO PUT BEEF IN THE TRIFLE.

549
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,889
IT DID NOT TASTE GOOD.

550
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:17,896
PHOEBE, I'M SORRY, BUT I THINK JACQUES COUSTEAU IS DEAD.

551
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,899
MONICA...

552
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,900
WHY YOU FELT

553
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,402
YOU HAD TO HIDE THE FACT

554
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,405
THAT YOU ARE IN AN IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP IS BEYOND ME.

555
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,908
AND WE KIND OF FIGURED ABOUT THE PORCH SWING.

556
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,911
ROSS...

557
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,415
DRUGS, DIVORCED... AGAIN.

558
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,418
WHAT HAPPENED, SON?

559
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:44,423
I... I, UH, I GOT TRICKED INTO ALL THOSE THINGS.

560
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:50,429
CHANDLER, YOU'VE BEEN ROSS'S BEST FRIEND ALL THESE YEARS

561
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,932
STUCK BY HIM DURING THE DRUG PROBLEMS.

562
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:59,438
AND NOW YOU'VE TAKEN ON MONICA AS WELL.

563
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,440
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

564
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,443
YOU'RE A WONDERFUL HUMAN BEING.

565
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,946
THANK YOU.

566
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:08,947
NO!

567
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,450
THANK YOU.

568
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,951
AND MONICA AND ROSS

569
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,455
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO ABOUT THE TWO OF YOU

570
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,458
I'LL TALK TO THEM.

571
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,632
YOU GUYS, IT WAS BANANAS

572
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,134
CREAM AND BEEF.

573
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:32,471
I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE THAT YOU ATE THAT

574
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,973
SO THAT I WOULDN'T FEEL BAD.

575
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,475
ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T EAT MINE.

576
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,477
IT'S STILL IN THE BATHROOM.

577
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,478
NO, IT ISN'T. I ATE THAT.

578
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,483
AND WE LEFT OURS IN MONICA'S BEDROOM.

579
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,985
NO. GOT IT AND GOT YOURS, TOO.

580
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,487
 SO, CHANDLER

581
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,490
ARE YOU GOING TO STICK WITH THAT BIRD STORY?

582
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,992
IT WAS A BIG BIRD, SWOOPED RIGHT IN THERE.

583
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,995
HI.

584
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,996
OH, JANINE... OH, NO.

585
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,498
OH, IT'S NOT OVER, IS IT?

586
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,999
YEAH. WE ALL GOT DEPRESSED.

587
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,002
YOU KNOW, THE HOLIDAYS AND EVERYTHING AND WE'RE ALONE.

588
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,005
YEAH, WELL, AT LEAST YOU HAVE JOEY

589
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,007
BUT ROSS IS REALLY ALONE.

590
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,010
WELL, YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME HERE.

591
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,512
THIS IS MY MOM AND MY DAD.

592
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,513
THIS IS JANINE.

593
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,014
HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

594
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,516
I THINK WE'VE ALREADY MET.

595
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,517
REALLY?

596
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,018
I LIVE ACROSS THE HALL.

597
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,021
YOU WALKED IN ON ME WHEN I WAS CHANGING.
