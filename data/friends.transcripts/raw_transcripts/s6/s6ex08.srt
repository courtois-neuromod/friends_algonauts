1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,004

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,007
HEY. HI. MY NAME'S CHANDLER.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,508
I JUST MOVED IN NEXT DOOR

4
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,511
AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN BATTLING ME

5
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,513
IN A POST APOCALYPTIC WORLD FOR CONTROL

6
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,016
OF THE GALAXY'S LAST REMAINING ENERGY SOURCE?

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,017
SURE, NEIGHBOR.

8
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,518
COME ON IN.

9
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,520
SO, IS JANINE AROUND?

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,522
UH, NO, SHE'S AT DANCE CLASS.

11
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,024
CAN I CHECK OUT WHAT SHE DID WITH MY ROOM?

12
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,026
YEAH, BUT, HEY, LOOK, DON'T GO THROUGH HER STUFF.

13
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,027
SHE GETS REALLY MAD.

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,531
OH, MY GOD.

15
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,533
WHAT IS THI...

16
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,535
IT'S LIKE A GUY NEVER LIVED IN HERE.

17
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,037
LOOK, YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL.

18
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,538
THIS GIRL THING IS DANGEROUS.

19
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,040
IT'S SPREADING ALREADY.

20
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,541
IT IS?

21
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,044
YES, IS THIS YOUR PRETTY PINK PILLOW

22
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,545
ON THE COUCH?

23
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,546
NO.

24
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,548
IS THAT YOUR TINY LITTLE BOX

25
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,550
THAT'S TOO SMALL TO PUT ANYTHING IN?

26
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,551
NO.

27
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,552
NO.

28
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,054
OKAY, THIS IS NOT GOOD.

29
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,555
YOU ARE A GUY, OKAY?

30
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,057
 THIS IS A GUY'S PLACE.

31
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,559
IF YOU LET THIS GO, YOU'RE GOING TO BE SITTING AROUND

32
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,560
WITH YOUR FINGERS SOAKING

33
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,562
IN STUFF.

34
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,066
AND YOUR HEAD'S GOING TO BE UNDER A BIG, ROUND, DRYING...

35
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,068
BIG, DRYING... IT'S NOT GOOD!

36
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,569
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.

37
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,571
I'LL I'LL I'LL TALK TO HER.

38
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,073
YES, TALK TO HER-- BE A MAN.

39
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:13,573
I'M A MAN.

40
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,074
DEFEND YOURSELF.

41
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,075

42
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,077
CHANDLER, COME ON.

43
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,578
WE HAVE TO HEM THE NEW DUST RUFFLE.

44
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,580
BE RIGHT THERE, SWEETUMS.

45
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,584
A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SITUATION.

55
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:05,425
HEY, GUYS.

56
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,127
HEY, HOW WAS YOUR BREAKFAST WITH HILLARY?

57
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,128
IT WAS OKAY.

58
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,129
SHE'S STILL KIND OF DEPRESSED

59
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,131
BECAUSE SHE BROKE UP WITH HER BOYFRIEND.

60
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:15,135
WELL, IS THIS HILLARY YOUR HOT ASSISTANT CHEF HILLARY?

61
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:15,635
YEAH.

62
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,637
THE ONE THAT ALWAYS STARES AT ME

63
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,638
WHEN I COME IN?

64
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,640
NO, THE ONE WHO LOOKED AT YOU ONCE

65
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,642
BECAUSE YOU GOT IN HER WAY.

66
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:26,146
STILL, I COULD TELL SHE WAS INTO ME.

67
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,649
WHY DON'T YOU SET US UP?

68
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,152
OOH, ARE YOU SETTING ROSS UP WITH SOMEONE?

69
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,154
DOES SHE HAVE A WEDDING DRESS?

70
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,657
COME ON, MONICA. I'M SERIOUS.

71
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,660
OKAY, I'LL DO IT, BUT AS LONG AS YOU PROMISE YOU WON'T MARRY HER.

72
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,163
FINE. I...

73
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,665
BUT WHAT IF SHE'S THE ONE?

74
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,169
MAN, YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

75
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,172
HEY. HEY.

76
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,174
RACHEL? YEAH?

77
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,176
LISTEN, I'M, UM, MAKING UP FLYERS

78
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,178
TRYING TO GET NEW MASSAGE CLIENTS.

79
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,181
SO CAN I COME TO BLOOMINGDALE'S AND USE THE COPY MACHINE?

80
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,683
WELL, SURE, BUT THEY MIGHT THINK IT'S KIND OF WEIRD

81
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,685
CONSIDERING I DON'T WORK THERE ANYMORE.

82
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,187
OH, MY GOD!

83
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,688
WHAT HAPPENED?

84
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,690
I I GOT A JOB AT RALPH LAUREN.

85
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,192
WELL, THAT'S GREAT!

86
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,193
CONGRATULATIONS!

87
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,195
WOW!

88
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,197
A YEAR AGO.

89
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,699
YOU'VE LASTED A WHOLE YEAR.

90
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,700
GOOD FOR YOU.

91
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:21,701
OH.

92
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,203

93
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,205
BUT, PHEEBS, YOU YOU CAN STILL USE

94
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,207
THE COPY MACHINE WHERE I ACTUALLY WORK.

95
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,208
BUT JUST COME BY AT LUNCH

96
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,709
SO THAT MY BOSS DOESN'T SEE YOU

97
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,710
BECAUSE KIM WILL JUST FREAK OUT

98
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,712
AND SHE ALREADY DOESN'T LIKE ME VERY MUCH.

99
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,714
THAT'S WEIRD. I DON'T THINK MY BOSS LIKES ME, EITHER.

100
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,216
I DON'T THINK MINE LIKES ME, EITHER.

101
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,219
MAYBE IT'S A UNIVERSAL THING.

102
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,222
OR MAYBE... IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE ALL HANGING AROUND HERE

103
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,223
AT 11:30 ON A WEDNESDAY.

104
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,728
YEAH, LET'S HEAD OFF TO WORK. WE SHOULD GO.

105
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,234
THANK YOU.

106
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,235
SURE.

107
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,237
NOW, YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE THIS

108
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,239
BUT I WAS IN THE COPY ROOM, MAKING COPIES

109
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,240
AND RALPH LAUREN CAME IN.

110
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,241
OH, MY GOD.

111
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,742
DID YOU TALK TO HIM?

112
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,743
YEAH, A LITTLE.

113
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,744
HE SEEMS REALLY NICE.

114
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,745
GOOD KISSER.

115
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,247
WHAT?

116
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,248
WHAT?

117
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,250
YOU KISSED HIM?

118
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,251
TOTALLY.

119
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,252

120
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,753
PHOEBE, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

121
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,255
YEAH. I WAS JUST IN THERE.

122
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,756
HE CAME IN, HE INTRODUCED HIMSELF

123
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,759
AND, THEN, NEXT THING I KNOW, WE'RE MAKING OUT, YOU KNOW.

124
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,263
PHOEBE, I MEAN, YOU DO KNOW HE'S MARRIED?

125
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,265
NO.

126
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,766
PHOEBE...

127
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,270
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO-- ASK EVERY GUY I MAKE OUT WITH

128
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,771
IF HE'S MARRIED?

129
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,273
NO, YEAH, I SHOULD, I SHOULD.

130
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,286
HEY, JOEY.

131
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,287
HEY.

132
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,788
UH, CAN I TALK TO YOU

133
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,789
FOR A SECOND?

134
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,291
THIS, UH, KID IN THIS PICTURE.

135
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,792
DO YOU, UH, YOU KNOW THIS KID?

136
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,294
IS THAT LIKE A RELATIVE OR SOMETHING?

137
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,296
NO, I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS CUTE.

138
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,298
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF.

139
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,299
OKAY, UH...

140
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,300
LOOK, JANINE

141
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,802
I REALLY WANT YOU TO FEEL AT HOME HERE

142
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,805
BUT SOME OF THIS NEW STUFF, IT'S JUST... IT'S TOO GIRLIE.

143
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:06,806
OH.

144
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,308

145
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,309
LIKE THIS--

146
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,811
PICTURES OF CUTE BABIES WE DON'T KNOW.

147
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,813
WE WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.

148
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,315
JOEY, IT'S ANNE GEDDES.

149
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,816
SHE'S A FAMOUS ARTIST.

150
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,818
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW THIS BABY.

151
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,321
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S A FAMOUS ARTIST OR NOT

152
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,323
YOU KNOW, AND...

153
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,824
I DON'T WANT TO BE A JERK

154
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,827
BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE CHANGING TOO MUCH AROUND HERE.

155
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:28,828
WELL, I'M SORRY.

156
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,330
I JUST THOUGHT I'D TRY

157
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,331
AND MAKE THE PLACE A LITTLE NICER.

158
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,833
YEAH, BUT IT'S IT'S TOO MUCH STUFF.

159
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,835
YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU GOT THE CANDLES

160
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,338
AND THE FOOFY SCHMOOFER THING HERE

161
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,839
AND, THEN, OVER HERE

162
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,342
YOU GOT A PICTURE OF A WATERING CAN.

163
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,843
WELL, I JUST THOUGHT...

164
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,346
I'M SURE IT'S A FAMOUS WATERING CAN, OKAY

165
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,847
BUT, COME ON...

166
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,849
AND WHAT IS WITH THE REALLY HOT STICK

167
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,351
IN THE BATHROOM?

168
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,853
IT'S A CURLING IRON.

169
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,360
OH.

170
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,362
WELL WELL, THAT'S OKAY, THEN...

171
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,863
BUT, OKAY, MY TOWELS

172
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,365
FOR INSTANCE, OKAY?

173
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,866
I COME INTO THE BATHROOM HERE

174
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,370
AND MY TOWEL IS NOT ON THE FLOOR WHERE I KEEP IT.

175
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,872
IT'S UP HERE, ON SOME HOOK

176
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,375
AND... SMELLS DIFFERENT.

177
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,376
IT'S CLEAN.

178
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,378
IT FEELS DIFFERENT.

179
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,380
IT'S DRY.

180
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,385
ALL RIGHT, I CAN MAKE MY PEACE WITH THE CLEAN, DRY TOWELS...

181
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,387
AND, OKAY, ALSO, WHAT IS WITH THESE CHIPS YOU BOUGHT?

182
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:28,388
NO, NO, NO.

183
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,889
IT'S POTPOURRI.

184
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,891
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SMELL IT.

185
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,901
WELL, THAT'S LIKE SUMMER IN A BOWL.

186
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,413
OH.

187
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,914
KIM, HI.

188
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,916
UH HUH.

189
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,919

190
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,422
SO, YOU KNOW, I I I HAND ED IN THAT MARKETING REPORT

191
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,924
AND I... AND I NEVER GOT TO HEAR WHAT YOU THOUGHT.

192
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,426
I DIDN'T READ IT.

193
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,927
AH.

194
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,929

195
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,431
SO, WOW, THE SPRING LINE--

196
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,933
IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE GREAT THIS YEAR, HUH?

197
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,435
YEAH.

198
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,939

199
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,442
SO, I HEAR, UH, RALPH LAUREN FOOLED AROUND

200
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,943
WITH SOMEONE IN THE COPY ROOM.

201
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,447
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

202
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,951
HEY, GUYS.

203
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,952
HEY.

204
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,454
WHAT'S UP?

205
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,458
YOU KNOW...

206
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,960
OH, MY GOD.

207
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,962
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR TEETH?

208
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,464
I WHITENED THEM.

209
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,967
REALLY?

210
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,968
YEAH.

211
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,471
WH WHAT DO YOU THINK?

212
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,973
WELL, I THINK I SHOULDN'T LOOK DIRECTLY AT THEM.

213
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,975
COME ON, SERIOUSLY.

214
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,980
ROSS, THEY'RE REALLY, REALLY, REALLY WHITE.

215
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,484
YEAH, WHAT WAS WRONG WITH YOUR OLD... HUMAN TEETH?

216
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:09,489
OH, I I DID LEAVE THE GEL ON A LITTLE LONGER THAN IT SAID TO.

217
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,490
HOW MUCH LONGER?

218
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,492
A A A DAY.

219
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,995
ROSS, YOU KNOW THAT TONIGHT IS YOUR DATE WITH HILLARY?

220
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:16,996
I KNOW.

221
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,498
THAT'S WHY I DID IT.

222
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,000
COME ON, ARE THEY REALLY THAT BAD?

223
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,503
NO. NO, NO, NO, YOU'LL YOU'LL BE FINE.

224
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,505
HILLARY'S BLIND, RIGHT?

225
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,507
SHE WILL BE AFTER TONIGHT.

226
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,008
YEAH.

227
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,512
OH, HEY, HEY, RACHE, UH

228
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,513
DO YOU NOT ICE ANYTHING...

229
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,515
YEAH, YOUR TEETH?

230
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,517
YES, I SAW THEM FROM OUTSIDE.

231
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,019
YOU GUYS ARE NEVER GOING TO BELIEVE THIS

232
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,022
BUT PHOEBE... MADE OUT...

233
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,524
WITH RALPH LAUREN.

234
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,025
WHAT? OH, MY GOD.

235
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,026
YEAH, I KNOW.

236
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,528
SHE RAN INTO HIM AT MY OFFICE

237
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,529
AND THEY JUST... MADE OUT

238
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,031
AND THE CRAZIEST THING IS NOW MY BOSS LIKES ME

239
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,033
BECAUSE I TOLD HER ABOUT IT AND SHE SAID IT WAS

240
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,535
THE BEST GOSSIP SHE'D HEARD ALL YEAR.

241
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,037
I AM PROUD OF  ALL MY FRIENDS TODAY.

242
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,039
MY GOD, RACHEL, I CAN'T BELIEVE

243
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,542
PHOEBE MADE OUT WITH RALPH LAUREN.

244
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,044
OH, I'M SO JEALOUS.

245
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,548
HI, I'M CHANDLER, YOUR LIVE IN BOYFRIEND.

246
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,050
CHANDLER, PLEASE, COME ON.

247
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,052
LOOK AT HIM.

248
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:18,057
OH, I AM NO WOMAN, BUT THAT IS ONE TASTY DISH.

249
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,058
HEY.

250
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,560
HERE.

251
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,563
OOH, WHO'S THE SILVER FOX?

252
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,566
THAT THAT IS YOUR MAKE OUT BUDDY.

253
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,568
DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE HIM?

254
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,069
OH, WAIT.

255
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,071
OOH, PHOEBE, I LOVE YOU.

256
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,573
KISS ME, PLEASE.

257
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,575
THAT'S NOT RALPH LAUREN.

258
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,577
SOUNDS LIKE HIM, THOUGH.

259
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,078
WHAT?

260
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,079
YEAH, NO, RALPH'S...

261
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,081
DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THAT GUY.

262
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,583
HE'S HE'S YOUNG

263
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,586
AND HE'S GOT LONG HAIR AND A BEARD AND A HACKY SACK.

264
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,088
OH, MY GOD, PHOEBE, THAT'S NOT RALPH LAUREN.

265
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,090
THAT'S KENNY THE COPY GUY.

266
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,092
WHAT?

267
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,594
OH, G... OH... AND I TOLD MY BOSS

268
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,596
THAT SOMEONE MADE OUT WITH RALPH LAUREN.

269
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,097
IF SHE FINDS OUT THAT I LIED TO HER

270
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,099
SHE IS GOING TO HATE ME EVEN MORE.

271
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,100
PHOEBE!

272
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,103
WHY WOULD THE COPY GUY SAY THAT HE'S RALPH LAUREN?

273
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,105
TO GET YOU TO MAKE OUT WITH HIM.

274
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,107
OH.

275
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,615
OKAY, MAYBE THIS WILL MAKE

276
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,116
YOUR TEETH LOOK LESS WHITE.

277
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,621
NOPE.

278
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,122
NOPE.

279
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,625
OKAY, SO, UH, COLORS THAT DON'T WORK ARE

280
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,626
BLUE, YELLOW, GREEN, RED

281
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,128
BLACK, WHITE, ORANGE AND PURPLE.

282
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,632
YOU WANT TO TRY THIS HIGHLIGHTER AGAIN?

283
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,635
NO. I THINK IT POISONED ME A LITTLE.

284
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,638
AND THE DATE STARTS IN, LIKE, AN HOUR.

285
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,640
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

286
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,643
HEY, MAYBE IF YOUR SKIN WAS A LITTLE LIGHTER

287
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,646
YOUR TEETH WOULDN'T STAND OUT SO MUCH.

288
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,647
OH, GREAT.

289
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,149
SO, I ALL NEED TO DO IS GET SOME NEW SKIN.

290
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,151
THANK YOU.

291
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,653
I'M JUST SAYING IF WE PUT

292
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,655
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF MAKEUP ON YOU...

293
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,656
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

294
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,158
WE'RE NOT 13 ANYMORE.

295
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,662
ROSS, THIS IS  THE ONLY THING LEFT

296
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,163
THAT HAS A SHOT AT WORKING.

297
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,666
BUT WON'T SHE NOTICE I HAVE MAKEUP ON?

298
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,668
PLEASE, HALF THE GUYS OUT THERE HAVE MAKEUP ON.

299
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,670
WHAT?

300
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,171
ALL RIGHT, HALF THE PEOPLE.

301
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,173
I MEAN... WILL YOU JUST TRY IT AND SEE?

302
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,675
NO, I AM NOT PUTTING ON MAKEUP.

303
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:16,676

304
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:17,677
HELLO?

305
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,178
OH, GOOD.

306
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,681
ROSS, COULD YOU PUT UP SOME OF THESE FLYERS FOR ME?

307
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,183
NO! DEMON! DEMON!

308
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,692
NOW OUR DRAWERS WILL SMELL NICE

309
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,695
AND WE DIDN'T WASTE  THESE PANTYHOSE.

310
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,697
YES. GOD FORBID WE THROW OUT OLD UNDERWEAR.

311
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,198
YOU KNOW WHAT?

312
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,701
I'M I'M GOING TO... I'M GOING TO GO OVER TO JOEY'S.

313
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,203
WAIT, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO ORGANIZE THE WRAPPING PAPER DRAWER.

314
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,706
YES, BUT I FEEL LIKE I'VE REALLY GOTTEN IN TOUCH

315
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,708
WITH MY FEMININE SIDE ENOUGH TODAY, YOU KNOW.

316
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,709
IN FACT, I THINK

317
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,210
WE'RE TWO SACHETS

318
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,712
AWAY FROM BECOMING A LESBIAN COUPLE.

319
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,715
YOU KNOW WHAT?

320
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,216
THIS HAS BEEN KIND OF A GIRLIE DAY.

321
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,217
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY.

322
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,719
NAH, NAH, THAT'S OKAY.

323
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,220
I I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO BE IN A GUY PLACE...

324
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,222
YOU KNOW, DO KIND  OF, LIKE, A MAN THING.

325
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,724
YEAH. GO OVER TO JOEY'S.

326
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,226
GO OVER TO JOEY'S AND AND DRINK SOME BEER

327
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,728
AND HAMMER UP SOME DRY WALL.

328
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,730
YOU KNOW, WHEN GUYS HANG OUT

329
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,232
THEY DON'T JUST DRINK BEER AND HAMMER UP DRY WALL.

330
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,235
WHEN GIRLS HANG OUT, WE DON'T HAVE PILLOW FIGHTS

331
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,238
IN OUR UNDERWEAR.

332
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,239
I'M SORRY.

333
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,240
WE DO.

334
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,241
WE DO.

335
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,743
I DON'T KNOW WHY I SAID THAT.

336
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,748
HEY, CHANDLER.

337
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,249
COME ON IN.

338
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,752
WE'RE KNITTING POT HOLDERS.

339
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,756
NO THANKS, JOSEPHINE.

340
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,257

341
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,261
HEY, ROSS, I WAS WONDERING IF...

342
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,266
OH, MY GOD!

343
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,268
WHERE ARE ALL THE MEN?

344
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,280
OH, HI, KIM.

345
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,282
HI, RACHEL.

346
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,784
REMEMBER THAT THING I TOLD YOU

347
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,285
THAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY?

348
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,787
WELL, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

349
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,289
YOU DIDN'T CANCEL THE FABRIC ORDER FROM TAIWAN?

350
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,291
OKAY, TWO THINGS DIDN'T HAPPEN.

351
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,294
REMEMBER I TOLD YOU THAT SOMEONE MADE OUT

352
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,296
WITH RALPH LAUREN IN THE COPY ROOM?

353
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,799
WELL, IT TURNS OUT THAT'S NOT TRUE.

354
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,800
THAT'S NOT TRUE?

355
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,801
NO. OH, THAT'S INTERESTING

356
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,803
BECAUSE I CHECKED.

357
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,304
AND ONLY ONE KEY CARD WAS USED

358
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,306
TO ACCESS THE COPY MACHINE YESTERDAY DURING LUNCH

359
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,809
AND THAT KEY CARD BELONGED TO YOU, RACHEL.

360
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,810
OH, NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.

361
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,312
OH, GOD, YOU THINK I MADE OUT WITH HIM?

362
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,313
LISTEN TO ME.

363
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,815
IF YOU THINK SLEEPING WITH RALPH

364
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,816
IS GOING TO GET YOU MY JOB

365
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,317
YOU ARE SADLY MISTAKEN.

366
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,319
I DON'T WANT YOUR JOB. I DON'T!

367
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,821
THIS IS SUCH A MISTAKE.

368
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,823
I DID NOT MAKE OUT WITH HIM.

369
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,324
NOBODY MADE OUT WITH HIM.

370
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,827
I DID NOT USE MY KEY CARD YESTERDAY.

371
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,329
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO USE MY KEY CARD.

372
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,331
HI, RALPH.

373
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,332
HI, KIM.

374
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,353
YEAH, NOTHING HAPPENED.

375
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,857
YOU COULD CUT THE SEXUAL TENSION IN HERE WITH A KNIFE.

376
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,366
AND, AFTER THAT, WHAT COULD I DO EXCEPT BECOME A CHEF?

377
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,368
MM HMM.

378
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,871

379
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,873
MMM.

380
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,375
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A REALLY GREAT LISTENER.

381
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,879
MOST GUYS I GO OUT WITH, THEY JUST TALK AND TALK.

382
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,882
MM HMM.

383
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,384
AFTER A WHILE, IT'S JUST, LIKE, SHUT YOUR MOUTH, YOU KNOW?

384
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,387
HMM HMM!

385
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,889
I'VE PROBABLY BEEN TALKING TOO MUCH.

386
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,390
WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT YOU A LITTLE BIT?

387
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,393
MM MMM.

388
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,895

389
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,898
HMM HMM HMM.

390
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,399
OKAY.

391
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,902
I, UM, I'M FROM LONG ISLAND.

392
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,404
I CAME TO THE CITY FOR COLLEGE.

393
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,407
UM, I, UH, I HAVE A FIVE YEAR OLD SON.

394
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,409
AND, IN MY SPARE TIME

395
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,411
I LIKE TO READ SPY NOVELS.

396
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,414
BUT LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT YOU, HMM?

397
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,419
SO WHAT'S REALLY NEAT IS

398
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,421
IF YOU SEAR THE STEMS OF THE FLOWERS FIRST

399
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,923
IN A FRYING PAN

400
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,926
YOUR ARRANGEMENT WILL LOOK FRESH MUCH LONGER.

401
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,929
OH, MY GOD, JOEY, TH AT IS SUCH A GREAT TIP.

402
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,931
MONICA, CAN YOU EXCUSE US FOR A SECOND?

403
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,934
I NEED TO TALK TO THE GIRL WITH THE FLOWERS.

404
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,936
OKAY.

405
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,437
OH, JOEY, COME OVER LATER

406
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,438
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU

407
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,940
HOW TO MAKE A BIRD FEEDER

408
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,942
OUT OF JUST A PINECONE AND SOME PEANUT BUTTER.

409
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,444
OH... I LOVE BIRDS.

410
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,448
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

411
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,950
WHAT?

412
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,951
YOU'RE ARRANGING FLOWERS!

413
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,954
YOU GOT DEAD FLOWERS!

414
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,457
YOU GOT A PICTURE OF A BABY DRESSED LIKE FLOWERS!

415
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,961
THIS IS NOT JOEY.

416
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,463
HEY, HEY, LOOK, I AM STILL JOEY, OKAY?

417
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,965
FLOWERS, THEY'RE JUST

418
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,467
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NICE TO LOOK AT

419
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:12,471
AND THAT HAPPENS TO BE A PICTURE BY A FAMOUS ARTIST

420
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,973
OF A FAMOUS BABY.

421
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,475
YOU'RE TURNING INTO A WOMAN.

422
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,476
NO, I'M NOT.

423
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,478
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

424
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,980
THAT'S JUST MEAN.

425
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,482
NOW I'VE UPSET YOU?

426
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,484
WHAT DID I SAY?

427
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,486
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID

428
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,489
IT'S JUST THE WAY YOU SAID IT.

429
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,991
OH, MY GOD!

430
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:32,992
I'M A WOMAN!

431
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,000
SO NOW SHE THINKS THAT I MADE OUT WITH HIM

432
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,002
AND THAT I DID IT TO GET HER JOB.

433
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,004
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL HER THE TRUTH?

434
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,005
I DID.

435
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,506
BUT SHE DOESN'T THINK

436
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,008
THAT ANYONE WOULD BE STUPID ENOUGH

437
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,510
TO CONFUSE KENNY THE COPY GUY WITH RALPH LAUREN.

438
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,513
WELL, HEY, WHAT IF KENNY WERE THE REAL BRAINS

439
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,016
BEHIND THE WHOLE COMPANY, YOU KNOW?

440
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,518
GUY WHAT IF KENNY HIRED THAT RALPH LAUREN

441
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,520
TO BE THE PRETTY FRONT MAN, HUH?

442
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,522
DID SHE EVER THINK OF THAT?

443
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:08,527
YOU WERE WITH KENNY TODAY, WEREN'T YOU?

444
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,030
JUST FOR A SECOND.

445
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,533
OH... PHOEBE, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

446
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,035
WELL, THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO.

447
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,036
SLEEP WITH RALPH LAUREN.

448
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:21,040
I'M NOT GOING TO SLEEP WITH RALPH LAUREN.

449
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,043
I MEAN, I COULD, BUT I WOULDN'T.

450
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,545
OH, SLEEP WITH KENNY.

451
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,550
THAT WOULDN'T HELP ME.

452
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,053
OH, YES, IT WOULD.

453
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,557
I'VE HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME TONIGHT.

454
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,558
MMM.

455
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,560
YOU KNOW, I RARELY CONNECT WITH SOMEONE

456
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,562
THIS MUCH ON THE FIRST DATE.

457
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,563
HMM MM, HMM MM.

458
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,065
ME, NEITHER.

459
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:52,071
I'VE HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME, TOO, YOU KNOW.

460
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,573
ARE YOU GOING TO EAT THAT BREAD?

461
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,577
OH, I I I JUST LIKE THE SMELL.

462
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,580
...MMM.

463
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,082
YOU MAKE ME LAUGH.

464
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,084
HM MMM.

465
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,586
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MOVE OVER TO THE COUCH?

466
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,589
MM HMM.

467
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:16,095
MAYBE I'LL JUST TURN DOWN THE LIGHTS A LITTLE.

468
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,098
HOW ABOUT ALL THE WAY?

469
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,600
OKAY.

470
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,609
WOW, COOL POSTER.

471
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:35,114
OR, SHOULD I SAY GROOVY POSTER?

472
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,117
SO, UH, WHERE WERE WE?

473
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,624
ARE THOSE YOUR TEETH?

474
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:51,130
OH, YOU... YOU CAN SEE THEM, HUH?

475
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,632
YES. THEY'RE INSANELY WHITE.

476
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:58,637
YEAH, I DID THAT FOR YOU.

477
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,639
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

478
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,142
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME?

479
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,643
YOU'VE GOT A BLACK LIGHT!

480
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,645
IT'S 1999!

481
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,153
OH, GOOD.

482
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,154
KIM, HI.

483
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,655
HI, RACHEL.

484
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,657
OH, I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK YOU.

485
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,160
HAVE YOU SEEN THE  NEW RALPH LAUREN SHEETS?

486
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,661
WHAT AM I THINKING?

487
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,163
OF COURSE YOU HAVE.

488
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,664
OKAY. OKAY, LOOK.

489
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,167
I'M SORRY THAT I LIED TO YOU BEFORE.

490
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,168
YOU WERE RIGHT.

491
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,172
RALPH AND I WERE AN ITEM, BUT WE'RE NOT ANYMORE.

492
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,173
OH, REALLY?

493
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,176
YEAH. HE DUMPED ME.

494
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,677
HE SAID

495
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,680
"RACHEL, I CAN'T DO THIS.

496
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,685
"EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE A VERY, VERY, VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

497
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,687
"I CAN'T DO THIS.

498
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,689
I'M MARRIED AND I'M SORRY."

499
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,691
AND THEN-- I DON'T KNOW WHY--

500
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,694
BUT HE SAID, "AND YOU WILL NEVER GET PROMOTED

501
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,198
"ESPECIALLY NOT ABOVE KIM, WHO IS AN INTEGRAL COG

502
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,200
IN THE RALPH LAUREN MACHINE."

503
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,704
YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THAT...

504
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,706
HI, RALPH.

505
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,707
HI, KIM.

506
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,727
OH, MY GOD.

507
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:33,232
HE JUST GAVE YOU THE COLDEST LOOK I HAVE EVER SEEN.

508
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,234
IT'S LIKE HE HATES YOU.

509
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,735
THEN IT IS TRUE?

510
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,738
OF COURSE IT'S TRUE.

511
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,741
AND IT HURTS SO BAD.

512
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,244
OH, HONEY, COME HERE.

513
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,246
OH, IT'LL BE OKAY.

514
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,250
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.

515
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,754
Y Y Y YOU AND RALPH?

516
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,258
KENNY THE COPY BOY.

517
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:10,836
HEY!

518
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:11,837
HEY, UH...

519
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,839
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

520
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,774
WHAT'S THE MATTER? ARE YOU UPSET?

521
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,776
WOULD YOU LIKE  ME TO GET A PINT

522
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,778
OF ICE CREAM AND TWO SPOONS?

523
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,780
NO, NO, NO. NO ICE CREAM.

524
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,782
LOOK, UM... I'M SORRY, BUT WE GOT TO GET RID

525
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,285
OF ALL THIS GIRLIE STUFF IN HERE.

526
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,287
I, UH, I GOT TO BE A MAN.

527
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,788
OKAY?

528
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,791
THE LIVING ROOM HAS TO REMAIN A GUY PLACE, OKAY?

529
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,793
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT HAS TO BE.

530
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,296
WELL, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, I'LL JUST PUT IT ALL IN MY ROOM.

531
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,797
GOOD. GREAT... GREAT.

532
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,300
AND, UH, THANKS FOR BEING SO UNDERSTANDING.

533
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,301
I MEAN, I DIDN'T WANT

534
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,803
TO MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS, YOU KNOW.

535
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,806
WELL, BUT YOU COULD, UH, PUT THE PICTURE

536
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,808
OF THE FAMOUS BABY IN MY ROOM.

537
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,810
I MEAN, IF YOU WANT TO.

538
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,813
OKAY.

539
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,317
AND, UH, MAYBE THE WATERING CAN THERE.

540
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,818
SURE.

541
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:04,323
AND A COUPLE OF THESE LITTLE TINY BOXES.

542
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,825
JOEY, DO YOU WANT ME TO PUT IT ALL IN YOUR ROOM?

543
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,827
OKAY.
