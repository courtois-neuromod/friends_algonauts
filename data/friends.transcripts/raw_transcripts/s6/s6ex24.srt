1
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:04,571
GOD, THAT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:06,506
ENGAGEMENT RING EVER.

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,008
YEAH, WELL, YOU SHOULD KNOW.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,510
YOU'VE BOUGHT, LIKE, A BILLION OF THEM.

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,013
YEAH, YOU DIDN'T GET ONE.

6
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,016
OKAY. WELL, TONIGHT'S THE BIG NIGHT.

7
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,517
HEY, LISTEN, HOW YOU GOING TO ASK HER?

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,019
IT IS GOING TO BE PERFECT.

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,021
I AM TAKING HER TO HER FAVORITE RESTAURANT

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,522
I'M GOING TO GET HER A BOTTLE

11
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,524
OF THE CHAMPAGNE THAT SHE REALLY LOVES

12
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,026
THEREFORE KNOWS HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS.

13
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,529
THEN, WHEN THE GLASSES ARE FULL

14
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:33,033
INSTEAD OF PROPOSING A TOAST, I'M JUST GOING TO PROPOSE.

15
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,034
OH...

16
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,535
IT SOUNDS PERFECT.

17
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:36,536
YEAH.

18
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,038
YOU'RE GOING TO MESS IT UP.

19
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,039
LET ME DO IT.

20
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,540
I'M NOT GOING TO MESS IT UP.

21
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,542
IF SHE SAYS NO, CAN I HAVE THE RING?

22
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,045
SHE'S NOT GOING TO SAY NO.

23
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,546
IF!

24
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,547
SURE.

25
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,049
WELL, WAIT, WHAT ABOUT ME?

26
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,050
I WANT IT, TOO.

27
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,052
SHE'S NOT GOING TO SAY NO.

28
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,053
I'LL LET YOU BORROW IT.

29
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,055
 THANK YOU.

30
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,556
HEY.

31
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,557

HI, MONICA.

34
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,064
GIVE IT.

35
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,565
IT'S GONE.

36
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,567
PHOEBE.

37
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,573
HEY, MONICA.

38
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,078
WE'RE PRACTICALLY KISSING.    48 00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,117 HEY. HEY.

49
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,119
ARE ANY OF YOU GUYS FREE TONIGHT?

50
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,121
MY BOSS IS HOSTING THIS CHARITY EVENT

51
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,622
FOR UNDERPRIVILEGED KIDS

52
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,625
AND THE MORE PEOPLE I BRING, THE BETTER I LOOK.

53
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,626
SO, MONICA, CHANDLER...

54
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,628
WELL, MONICA AND CHANDLER CAN'T GO.

55
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,130
WE'RE GOING TO DINNER, REMEMBER?

56
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,631
OH, MY GOD, I'M SO SORRY.

57
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,133
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

58
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,634
I JUST GET MAD

59
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:20,140
WHEN RACHEL DOESN'T REMEMBER WHERE WE'RE GOING.

60
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,641
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

61
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,644
HOW ABOUT YOU GUYS?

62
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:25,645
OPEN BAR?

63
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,647
I THINK SO.

64
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,649
I CAN DO THAT FOR THE KIDS.

65
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,650
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

66
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,651
I'LL COME, TOO.

67
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,153
I'M MAKING MONEY NOW.

68
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,155
IT'S ABOUT TIME I GIVE SOMETHING BACK.

69
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,657
WELL, YOU COULD ALSO GIVE BACK THE MONEY YOU OWE ME.

70
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:41,161
OKAY... HAVE A BENEFIT.

71
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,663
HEY.

72
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,165
HEY, ROSS, LISTEN, CAN YOU

73
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,666
COME TO A CHARITY EVENT TONIGHT?

74
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,169
OH, NO, I HAVE PLANS WITH ELIZABETH.

75
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,172
OH, SO YOU'RE ALREADY DOING YOUR PART FOR THE KIDS.

76
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,675
SORRY, IT'S JUST ONE OF OUR LAST NIGHTS TOGETHER

77
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,678
BEFORE SHE LEAVES FOR CAMP-- TO BE A COUNSELOR.

78
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,181
ROSS, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

79
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,684
ALL JOKES ASIDE, WHERE IS THIS RELATIONSHIP GOING?

80
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,187
WAIT A MINUTE? ALL JOKES ASIDE?

81
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,688
I DIDN'T AGREE TO THAT.

82
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,192
DO YOU REALLY SEE THIS AS A LONG TERM THING?

83
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,693
I DON'T KNOW.

84
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,695
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE 12 YEARS OLDER THAN HER.

85
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,197
WELL, WHO'S COUNTING?

86
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,198
WELL, SHE IS.

87
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,699
SHE'S THIS MANY.

88
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,703
ROSS, SHE IS REALLY YOUNG.

89
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,706
WAIT A MINUTE-- DOES EVERYONE FEEL THIS WAY?

90
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,707
YEAH. SORT OF.

91
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,708
YEAH, SORRY.

92
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,709
OH, WOW, UH...

93
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:30,710
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS

94
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,712
WERE JUST, LIKE, MAKING JOKES.

95
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,713
I HAD NO IDEA.

96
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,216
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU GUYS ARE WRONG.

97
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,718
YES, THERE IS ACHRONOLOGICAL AGE DIFFERENCE

98
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,220
BUT I NEVER NOTICE IT.

99
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,722
YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE SHE IS VERY MATURE.

100
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,724
BESIDES, IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER TO ME

101
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,725
WHAT YOU GUYS THINK.

102
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,727
I'M THE ONE DATING ELIZABETH, NOT YOU.

103
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,730
NOT WHAT SHE SAID LAST NIGHT.

104
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,234
YEAH. SEE, NOW, HE COULD DATE HER.

105
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,741
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

106
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,743
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

107
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,745
HEY, YOU MARRY ME.

108
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,754
WHAT'S GOING ON, LITTLE ELVES?

109
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,256
IT'S THE BIG NIGHT.

110
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,757
WE WANTED TO WISH YOU GOOD LUCK.

111
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,759
YEAH, YEAH. YOU HAVE THE RING?

112
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,760

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,262
OH...

00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,766
PHEEBS.

115
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,768
WHAT? OH. OOP!

116
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,771
OKAY, NOW, WILL YOU GUYS GET OUT OF HERE?

117
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,772
I WANT THIS TO BE A SURPRISE

118
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,274
AND SHE'S GOING TO KNOW.

119
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,276
YEAH, YEAH, YOU GUYS, GET OUT OF HERE.

120
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,279
HEY. HI, GUYS.

00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,297
EXCITED ABOUT THIS CHARITY EVENT

126
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,299

SO, NOW, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

130
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,311
UH, WELL, UH, THIS IS A SILENT AUCTION.

131
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,812
THEY LAY OUT ALL THE STUFF HERE

132
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,814
AND THEN YOU WRITE DOWN YOUR OFFER

133
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,816
AND THEN THE HIGHEST BID GETS IT.

134
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,818
NO, I KNOW WHAT A SILENT AUCTION IS.

135
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,321
I MEANT, WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR HAIR?

00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,834
PHOEBE, THIS IS MR. THOMPSON.

00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,375
THE GUYS ACROSS THE HALL ARE THROWING WATER BALLOONS AT US.

161
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,876
OH, YOU HAVE TO CALL THE POLICE.

162
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,379
THAT'S WHAT I DID TO THE KIDS IN MY BUILDING.

163
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,381
NO, IT'S A WATER BALLOON FIGHT.

164
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,382

00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,457
HEYA, GUYS, LOOK.

196
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,958
I GOT ME SOME DRINKS.

197
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,961
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

198
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,464
OPEN BAR.

199
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,467
YEAH, NOW IT'S AN EMPTY BAR.

200
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,471
YOU JUST CAN'T STAND ANYONE ELSE ENJOYING THEMSELF, CAN YOU?

201
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,972
AND FINALLY

202
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,474
OUR BIGGEST ITEM OF THE NIGHT.

203
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,478
THE 22 FOOT GENTLEMAN'S DAYSAILER SAILBOAT.

204
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,482
THE WINNING BID WAS A WHOPPING $20,000.

205
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,483
 OOH.

206
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,485
I WON.

207
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,488
THAT WAS MY GUESS.

208
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,490
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?

209
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,493
I GUESSED $20,000 DOLLARS.

210
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,495
JOEY, IT IS AN AUCTION.

211
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,497
YOU DON'T GUESS, YOU BUY.

212
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,998
WHAT?

213
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,503
I DON'T HAVE $20,000.

214
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,506
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NEW BOAT, JOEY TRIBBIANI!

215
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,512
JOEY, SIT DOWN.

216
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,513
FORGET HER.

217
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,514
YOU ENJOY THIS.

218
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,015
WOW! WOW!

219
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,018
WHOO.

220
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,031

221
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,033
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

222
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,036
ONE NATION...

223
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,538
UNDER GOD

224
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,039
INDIVISIBLE

225
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,542
WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.

226
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,544
I REMEMBERED IT.

227
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,546
THE CHAMPAGNE IS HERE.

228
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,548
ARE YOU OKAY?

229
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,049
YES, YES, I'M GOOD, ARE YOU GOOD?

230
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,552
IS EVERYTHING, ARE YOU ARE YOU PERFECT, PERFECT?

231
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,553
YEAH. I'M OKAY.

232
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,054
I'M ACTUALLY, I'M A LITTLE COLD, THOUGH.

233
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,556
CAN I HAVE YOUR JACKET?

234
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,557
OH, YEAH.

235
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,059
UH, NO, YOU CAN'T HAVE MY JACKET.

236
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,061
BECAUSE THEN I WOULD BE COLD.

237
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,064
IF YOU THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE GOING TO BE COLD

238
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,567
YOU SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT YOUR OWN JACKET.

239
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,071
BUT, UH, OTHER THAN THAT ARE YOU OKAY?

240
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,072
ARE YOU OKAY?

241
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,575
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

242
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,076
YES. I'M FINE.

243
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:42,081
IN FACT, I'VE BEEN FINE FOR A LONG TIME NOW

244
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,585
AND I THINK... THE REASON IS YOU.

245
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,087
MM, THAT'S SWEET.

246
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,088
OKAY, UM...

247
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,090

248
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,595
BEFORE I MET YOU, I HAD REALLY LITTLE LIFE

249
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,599
AND I COULDN'T IMAGINE GROWING OLD WITH...

250
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,600
OH, MY GOD.

251
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,101
I KNOW, BUT JUST LET ME SAY IT.

252
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,603
OH, MY GOD, RICHARD.

253
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,604
WHAT?

254
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,105
I'M CHANDLER.

255
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,109
OH, THAT'S RICHARD.

256
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,611
OH, GOD.

257
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,112
MAYBE HE WON'T SEE US. RICHARD!

258
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,619
MONICA. CHANDLER.

259
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,120
HEY, HEY.

260
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,624
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID THAT.

261
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,126
HEY, IT, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

262
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,629
YOU, TOO. YOU LET YOUR HAIR GROW LONG.

263
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,130
YEAH. OH, THAT'S RIGHT

264
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,632
YOU, YOU ALWAYS WANTED ME TO.

265
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,634
I SEE YOU GOT YOUR MUSTACHE BACK.

266
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,136
WELL, MY NOSE GOT LONELY.

267
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,138
AND, UH, YOU DON'T HAVE A MUSTACHE--

268
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,139
WHICH IS GOOD.

269
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,643
I'M CHANDLER, I MAKE JOKES

270
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,144
WHEN I'M UNCOMFORTABLE.

271
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,646
HI, I'M LISA.

272
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,148
OH, I'M SORRY. LISA.

273
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,650
MONICA, CHANDLER.

274
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,652
WE USED TO DATE.

275
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,653
RICHARD, NO ONE'S

276
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,655
SUPPOSED TO KNOW ABOUT US.

277
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,159
SEE, I DID IT AGAIN.

278
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,161
CHANDLER, WHY DON'T WE SIT DOWN.

279
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,663
YEAH, I'LL SIT DOWN.

280
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,664
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

281
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,165
YOUR TABLE'S READY, SIR.

282
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,167
OH. GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS.

283
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,168
YES.

284
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,169
OR, IF YOU PREFER

285
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,170
THIS TABLE'S AVAILABLE.

286
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,674
THAT MIGHT BE FUN.

287
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,181
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

288
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,184
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS AN AUCTION.

289
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,686
I FIGURED I'D TAKE A GUESS...

290
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,187
HELP A CHARITY...

291
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,189
FREE BOAT!

292
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,192
WHY WOULD A CHARITY GIVE AWAY A FREE BOAT?

293
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,194
I DON'T KNOW... CHARITY?

294
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,196
OH...

295
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,699
OH, JUST BUY THE DAMN BOAT.

296
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,200
PHOEBE, DON'T YOU THINK

297
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,202
YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH TO DRINK?

298
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,205
I'M JUST HELPING THE KIDS.

299
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,709
HOW IS YOU DRINKING HELPING THE KIDS?

300
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,210
BECAUSE THE MORE I DRINK

301
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,713
THE LESS THERE IS FOR THE KIDS TO DRINK.

302
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,719
MR. TRIBBIANI...

303
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,221
YOUR GENEROUS CONTRIBUTION BRINGS US A BIG STEP CLOSER

304
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,222
TO BUILDING THE YOUTH CENTER.

305
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,225
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW HAPPY I AM YOU BROUGHT HIM.

306
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,227
OH, SO SO AM I.

307
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,729
UH, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY

308
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,731
HOW... HOW MUCH IS THAT BOAT WORTH?

309
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,733
I THINK IT WAS VALUED AT $19,000 DOLLARS.

310
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,235
I WAS PRETTY CLOSE.

311
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,240
UH... SO, BAD NEWS.

312
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,743
UM... I CAN'T BUY THE BOAT.

313
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,245
I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

314
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,749

315
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,251
JOEY... JOEY, GOOD ONE.

316
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,252
YOU'RE SILLY.

317
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,755
VERY GOOD. VERY GOOD.

318
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,256

319
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,760
OH... SO, UH... LISTEN.

320
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,261
I THINK I'M GOING TO TAKE OFF NOW.

321
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,763
HEY, YOU CANNOT LEAVE, JOEY.

322
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,265
YOU AGREED TO BUY THAT BOAT, ALL RIGHT?

323
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,767
IT IS A CONTRACT.

324
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,770
PLUS, IF YOU LEAVE, MY BOSS IS GOING TO KILL ME.

325
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,271
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO, RACH?

326
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,773
I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY.

327
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,774
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

328
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,275
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.

329
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,778
WE ARE GOING TO GO TO THE NEXT HIGHEST BIDDER

330
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,780
AND WE ARE JUST GOING TO LET THEM BUY IT

331
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,781
AND THEN YOU'RE JUST

332
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,783
GOING TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE.

333
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,284
OKAY. LOOK, I DON'T KNOW

334
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,787
WHY THE KIDS NEED A YOUTH CENTER ANYWAY, YOU KNOW?

335
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,790
THEY SHOULD JUST WATCH TV AFTER SCHOOL, LIKE I DID

336
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,292
AND I TURNED OUT FINE.

337
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,794
NOT GREAT.

338
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,299
BOY, I'M HELPING THE KIDS SO MUCH

339
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,801
I THINK I'M GOING TO THROW UP.

340
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,305
SO WE'RE HIDING IN THE BATHROOM...

341
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,807
AND THEN I SNEAK OUT

342
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,809
BUT, BEFORE MONICA CAN, HER PARENTS COME IN.

343
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,311
SO I HIDE IN THE SHOWER AND, THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW

344
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,313
THEY'RE GOING AT IT RIGHT ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR.

345
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,815
OH, MY GOD!

346
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,817
I GOT A GOOD ONE. I GOT A GOOD ONE.

347
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,318
I ONCE WALKED IN

348
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,821
ON BOTH MY PARENTS MAKING LOVE TO THE SAME GUY.

349
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,830
IT'S SO GREAT SEEING YOU GUYS AGAIN.

350
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,832
I'D LIKE TO MAKE A TOAST.

351
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,333
UH... AS A POET ONCE SAID

352
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,335
"IN THE SWEETNESS OF FRIENDSHIP

353
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,338
"LET THERE BE LAUGHTER AND SHARING OF PLEASURES

354
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,340
"FOR IN THE DEW OF LITTLE THINGS

355
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,342
"THE HEART FINDS ITS MORNING

356
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,343
AND IS REFRESHED."

357
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,846
OH.

358
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,348
WHAT?

359
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,357
OH, MY GOD! YOU GUYS!

360
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,859
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING

361
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,861
HAVE WE GOT A STORY FOR YOU.

362
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,362
GUESS WHO WE BUMPED INTO AT DINNER.

363
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:23,863
WHO?

364
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,364
RICHARD.

365
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,866
WHO? OH!

366
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,368
OOH. OH, THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT.

367
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,871
THAT'S RICHARD'S FAVORITE PLACE, TOO.

368
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,372
OH, YOU KNEW THAT?

369
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,874
MM HMM. GOOD.

370
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,876
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING OUT WITH ELIZABETH.

371
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,378
YEAH, I WAS, BUT SHE WAS A LITTLE BUSY

372
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,380
WITH A WATER BALLOON FIGHT.

373
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,382
OH, ROSS, SOMETIMES, GROWNUPS HAVE COMMITMENTS

374
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,884
THEY JUST CAN'T GET OUT OF.

375
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,888
YEAH, MAYBE SHE IS TOO YOUNG FOR ME.

376
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,889
WHEN I WAS OVER THERE

377
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,891
AND SHE WAS RUNNING AROUND WITH HER FRIENDS

378
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,392
I FELT LIKE I WAS A BABY SITTER.

379
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,894
I FINALLY STARTED TO SEE

380
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,895
WHAT YOU GUYS WERE TALKING ABOUT.

381
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,396
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

382
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,898
WHY DON'T YOU JUST WEIGH OUT

383
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,900
THE GOOD STUFF ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP

384
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,901
AGAINST THE BAD STUFF?

385
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,903
THAT'S WHAT I DID WHEN I FIRST STARTED...

386
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,405
WEIGHING STUFF.

387
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,907
OKAY, BAD STUFF:

388
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,410
WELL, I'M 12 YEARS OLDER THAN SHE IS.

389
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,412
IF THE SCHOOL FINDS OUT, YOU'RE FIRED.

390
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,914
SHE'S LEAVING FOR THREE MONTHS.

391
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,415
FOR CAMP.

392
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,417
OKAY, GOOD STUFF:

393
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:23,422
UM... WELL, SHE'S... SHE'S SWEET AND PRETTY AND...

394
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,924
AND THE SEX IS PROBABLY PRETTY GREAT, HUH?

395
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:25,925
OH, OH.

396
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,426

397
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,930
IT'S TENDER AND RESPECTFUL, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.

398
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,935
LOOK, ROSS, THE ONLY QUESTION YOU NEED TO ANSWER IS

399
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,936
DO YOU SEE A FUTURE?

400
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,940
I MEAN, LIKE, DO YOU SEE YOURSELF MARRYING HER?

401
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,441
OH, MY GOD, YOU DID IT ALREADY.

402
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,443
YOU MARRIED HER, DIDN'T YOU?

403
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,947
NO, NO, I DIDN'T DO THAT.

404
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,448
IT'S JUST...

405
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,450
OKAY, HONESTLY, NO.

406
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,954
I DON'T... I DON'T SEE A BIG FUTURE WITH HER.

407
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,457
OKAY, WELL, I THINK THAT'S YOUR ANSWER.

408
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,959
I GOT TO TALK TO HER.

409
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,460
OH, I HATE THIS PART.

410
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,462
YOU HAVE TO FORGET ABOUT ELIZABETH.

411
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,464
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL

412
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,967
YOU MAY NOT GET MARRIED AT ALL THIS YEAR.

413
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,475
CHANDLER, ISN'T THERE SOMETHING YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DO TONIGHT?

414
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,478
OH, GOOD LUCK WITH THE ELIZABETH THING, MY MAN.

415
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:29,989
WHOO!

416
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,490

417
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,995
MYGOD,PHOEBE, HOW MANY HAVE YOU HAD?

418
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,496
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR

419
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,498
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN TIMES THREE-- 21.

420
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,502
YOU MUST BE JUST WASTED.

421
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,005
I'M A LITTLE TIRED.

422
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,506
RACHEL, RACHEL.

423
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,508
OKAY, THE NEXT HIGHEST BIDDER IS AT TABLE ONE.

424
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,509
OH, GREAT.

425
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,511
AND THE GUY WHO GOT THE PARIS TRIP

426
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,013
IS AT TABLE FOUR.

427
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,015
WHY DO YOU CARE ABOUT THE GUY WHO WON THE PARIS TRIP?

428
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,516
IT'S A TRIP FOR TWO.

429
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,518
EXCUSE ME.

430
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,025
EXCUSE ME.

431
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,027
IS THE PERSON WHO WON THE PARIS TRIP

432
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,528
AT THIS TABLE?

433
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,529
THAT WAS ME.

434
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,531
OH. ENCHANTE.

435
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,535
UH... EXCUSE ME.

436
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,038
IS THERE A MR. BOWMONT AT THIS TABLE?

437
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,539
THAT'S ME.

438
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,041
WELL, HELLO.

439
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,044
THIS IS YOUR LUCKY DAY, MR. BOWMONT.

440
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,046
THE GENTLEMAN DAYSAILER

441
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,048
HAS JUST BECOME AVAILABLE AGAIN.

442
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,551
AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU MADE A BID OF $18,000 DOLLARS.

443
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,552
YOU HAVE TO PAY THAT.

444
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,054
IT'S NOT JUST A GUESS.

445
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,555
OKAY.

446
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,559
I WAS ACTUALLY RELIEVED, UH...

447
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,061
I DIDN'T WIN THE BOAT.

448
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,562
MY WIFE WOULD HAVE KILLED ME.

449
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,563
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

450
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,065
SHE'S GOING TO LOVE THIS BOAT!

451
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,566
YEAH. WHAT IS YOUR WIFE'S NAME?

452
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:48,567
IT'S PAM.

453
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:53,072
PAM! JUST IMAGINE THIS: THE PAM.

454
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,074
OH... HO HO.

455
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,077
I DON'T THINK SHE'D LIKE THAT.

456
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:03,082
OKAY, IMAGINE THIS: THE MR. BOWMONT.

457
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,583
I DON'T THINK SO, DEAR.

458
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,086
OKAY, LOOK, LET ME PAINT YOU A LITTLE PICTURE.

459
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,089
ALL RIGHT, YOU ARE SETTING SAIL UP THE HUDSON.

460
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,591
YOU GOT THE WIND IN YOUR HA... ARMS.

461
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:16,095
YOU... YOU GET ALL THAT PEACE AND QUIET

462
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,597
THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

463
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,599
YOU GET BACK TO NATURE.

464
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,101
YOU CAN GO FISHING.

465
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,603
YOU CAN GET ONE OF THOSE LITTLE HATS

466
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,106
AND HAVE PEOPLE CALL YOU "CAPTAIN."

467
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,608
AND THEN, WHEN YOU'RE OLD, "CAPPY."

468
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,609
WHAT THE HELL.

469
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,611
IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE. ALL RIGHT!

470
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,613
NO WAY! IT'S MINE!

471
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,115
WHAT?

472
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,616
WHAT?

473
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,618
ALL THAT STUFF YOU JUST SAID--I WANT THAT!

474
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,621
JOEY, YOU DON'T HAVE $20,000 DOLLARS.

475
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,622
WHO CARES?

476
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,124
I'LL MAKE PAYMENTS!

477
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,625
WHATEVER IT TAKES!

478
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,127
I WANT THE MR. BOWMONT!

479
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,133
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE BACK!

480
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,634
OH, LET ME SEE IT! LET ME SEE YOUR HAND!

481
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,637
WHY DO YOU WANT TO SEE MY HAND?

482
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,639
I WANT TO SEE WHAT'S IN YOUR HAND.

483
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,141
I WANT TO SEE THE TRASH.

484
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,146
EWW! OOH, IT'S ALL DIRTY!

485
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,148
YOU SHOULD THROW THIS OUT.

486
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,150
OKAY.

487
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,154
WHAT DID YOU GUYS JUST DO?

488
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,655
WHAT HAPPENED?

489
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,657
RICHARD WAS THERE, SO I COULDN'T DO IT.

490
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,159
OH, NO.

491
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,162
I WAS GOING TO DO IT TOMORROW, YOU KNOW, AND SURPRISE HER

492
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,663
BUT NOW YOU'VE RUINED IT.

493
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,664
WE DIDN'T RUIN IT.

494
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,166
WHO WALKS INTO A ROOM

495
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,667
AND ASKS TO SEE A PERSON'S HANDS?

496
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,671
WELL, A PALM READER, A MANICURIST

497
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,173
A HAND DOCTOR.

498
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,675
GLOVE SALESMAN.

499
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,677
GOOD ONE! YEAH.

500
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,179
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

501
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,680
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

502
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,682
SHE ONLY SUSPECTS SOMETHING, OKAY?

503
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,683
SHE DOESN'T KNOW FOR SURE

504
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,685
SO JUST THROW HER OFF THE TRACK.

505
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,686
I COULD THROW HER OFF.

506
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,687
I COULD MAKE HER THINK

507
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,189
MARRIAGE WAS THE LAST THING ON MY MIND.

508
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,691
YEAH, CONVINCE HER THAT YOU'RE SCARED OF COMMITMENT.

509
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,693
CONVINCE HER THAT YOU'RE A LITTLE COWARD.

510
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,195
I CAN DO THAT.

511
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,197
I'VE HAD 30 YEARS OF PRACTICE.

512
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,199
HEY, BEING YOU IS FINALLY GOING TO PAY OFF.

513
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,203
I HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY TO THE BASEMENT

514
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,705
BECAUSE SOME IDIOT KEEPS STUFFING THE TRASH CHUTE

515
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,207
WITH PIZZA BOXES.

516
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,709
THAT GUY STILL DOING THAT?

517
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,213
HEY. OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE HERE!

518
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,714
LET ME SEE YOUR HAND!

519
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,715
YOU'RE TOO LATE!

520
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,218
SHE ALREADY TOOK OUT THE TRASH.

521
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:34,733
HI.

522
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,736
HI.

523
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,739
LOOK, ELIZABETH, WE WE HAVE TO TALK.

524
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,742
OH.

525
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:52,751
WOW. I HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH A HEALTHY BREAKUP.

526
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,255
SHE WAS SUCH A GROWNUP ABOUT IT.

527
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,259
SHE DIDN'T SEEM TOO IMMATURE FOR ME.

528
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,762
DID I JUST MAKE A HUGE MISTAKE?

529
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,764
ROSS, WAIT!

530
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,266
ELIZABETH... THANK GOD.

531
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,268
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT...

532
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,769
YOU SUCK!

533
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,771
WHAT?

534
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,279
OKAY.

535
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,282
BREAKUP'S STILL ON.

536
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,293
OKAY, OKAY, HERE SHE COMES.

537
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,296
DO I LOOK LIKE A GUY WHO DOESN'T WANT TO GET MARRIED?

538
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:41,800
YEAH. AND ALSO A LITTLE LIKE A FRENCH GUY.

539
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,805
I NEVER NOTICED THAT BEFORE.

540
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,807
HEY, GUYS.

541
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,808
HEY. HEY.

542
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,310
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

543
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,811
OH, JUST HANGING OUT.

544
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,313
TALKING ABOUT WEBSITES.

545
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,814
YEAH.

546
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:59,318
YEAH, WE SAW THIS REALLY INTERESTING WEBSITE

547
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,819
ABOUT MARRIAGE

548
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,321
AND HOW TOTALLY UNNECESSARY IT IS

549
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,822
AND HOW IT'S JUST A WAY

550
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,824
FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO KEEP TABS ON YOU.

551
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,326
YEAH. BIG BROTHER.

552
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,827
WELL, THAT'S A LITTLE CRAZY.

553
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,329
ALTHOUGH I AM, YOU KNOW, GLAD

554
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,830
TO HEAR THAT YOU'RE BRANCHING OUT

555
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,832
ON WHAT YOU LOOK AT ON THE INTERNET.

556
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,835
YOU KNOW, IT JUST GOT ME THINKING, THOUGH.
