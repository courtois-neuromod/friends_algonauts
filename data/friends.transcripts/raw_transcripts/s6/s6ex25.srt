559
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,842
TO SOLIDIFY YOUR COMMITMENT.

560
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,845
TO DECLARE YOUR LOVE FOR ONE ANOTHER TO THE WORLD.

561
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,847
EH...

562
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,851
OKAY, WELL, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

563
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,356
AH! THE MR. BOWMONT'S HERE!

564
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,863
HEY, MONICA, THERE'S A CUSTOMER

565
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,365
WHO WANTS TO COMPLIMENT THE CHEF.

566
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,366
SHALL I LET HIM IN?

567
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,368
SURE! I LOVE THIS PART!

568
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,869
COME ON IN.

569
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,871
HI.

570
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,873
RICHARD.

571
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,376
ACTUALLY, I'M NOT HERE TO COMPLIMENT THE CHEF.

572
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,877
OH, THAT'S OKAY.

573
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,381
I HATE WHEN PEOPLE COME BACK TO COMPLIMENT THE CHEF.

574
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,883
LIKE I HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO!

575
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,385
SO WHAT'S UP?

576
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,388
WELL, IT WAS GREAT SEEING YOU THE OTHER NIGHT.

577
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,390
IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.

578
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,393
DID YOU COME DOWN HERE TO TELL ME THAT?

579
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,396
NO. I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE.

580
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:23,402
I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU I STILL LOVE YOU.

581
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:25,904
WHAT, UH...

582
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,407
WHAT DID YOU... WHAT?

583
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,411
I STILL LOVE YOU...

584
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:36,415
AND I KNOW I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE TELLING YOU THIS.

585
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,417
I MEAN, YOU'RE WITH CHANDLER, A GUY I REALLY LIKE...

586
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,419
AND IF YOU SAY HE'S STRAIGHT

587
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,920
I'LL BELIEVE YOU.

588
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,922
AFTER SEEING YOU THE OTHER NIGHT

589
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,424
I KNEW IF I DIDN'T TELL YOU

590
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,426
I'D REGRET IT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

591
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,928
LETTING YOU GO WAS THE STUPIDEST THING

592
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:50,929
I EVER DID.

593
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,932
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE REALLY NOT SUPPOSED TO BE BACK HERE.

594
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,934
UH, WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY.

595
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,937
I KNOW THIS IS THE WRONG TIME AND THE WRONG PLACE

596
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,439
BUT I HAD TO TELL YOU.

597
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,441
I WANT TO SPEND MY LIFE WITH YOU.

598
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,942
I WANT TO MARRY YOU.

599
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,446
I WANT TO HAVE KIDS WITH YOU.

600
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,950
OH, MY GOD.

601
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,952
WHY DON'T THEY PUT CHAIRS BACK HERE?

602
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,956
LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS CRAZY, BUT... AM I TOO LATE?

603
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:18,957
WELL, Y...

604
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,958
YES, YOU'RE TOO LATE.

605
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,961
I MEAN, WHERE WAS ALL THIS THREE YEARS AGO?

606
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,463
WELL, I KNOW, I WAS AN IDIOT...

607
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,964
AND I TRIED TO FORGET YOU.

608
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,466
I I REALLY DID.

609
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,468
YOU KNOW, AFTER WE HAD LUNCH LAST YEAR

610
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,969
I SPENT SIX MONTHS IN AFRICA

611
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,971
TRYING TO GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD.

612
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,473
WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN AFRICA?

613
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:35,974
WORKING WITH BLIND KIDS.

614
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,977
OH... WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?

615
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,980
OH, LOOK... I'M SORRY, BUT, UM... IT'S...

616
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,483
THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

617
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,984
OKAY, THAT'S FINE.

618
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,487
I'LL WALK AWAY, AND I'LL NEVER BOTHER YOU AGAIN

619
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,490
BUT ONLY... IF YOU TELL ME THAT CHANDLER'S WILLING

620
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,991
TO GIVE YOU EVERYTHING I AM.

621
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,493
WELL, HE IS.

622
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,994
YEAH, I MEAN...

623
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,497
MARRIAGE IS ALL HE TALKS ABOUT.

624
00:24:58,997 --> 00:24:59,998
OH, MY GOODNESS.

625
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,001
IN FACT, I'M THE ONE THAT'S MAKING HIM WAIT.

626
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,002
YOU ARE?

627
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,003
YEAH. WHY?

628
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,005
WHY?

629
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,007
BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT.

630
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,013
ISN'T IT INCREDIBLE?

631
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,014
YEAH.

632
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:19,017
MONICA AND CHANDLER ARE GETTING MARRIED.

633
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,520
I KNOW. THEY'RE GOING TO BE SO HAPPY TOGETHER.

634
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,521
OH... I MEAN

635
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,022
TWO BEST FRIENDS FALLING IN LOVE--

636
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,524
HOW OFTEN DOES THAT HAPPEN?

637
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,525
NOT THAT OFTEN.

638
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,527
NO.

639
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,529
I'M SO HAPPY FOR THEM.

640
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,530
ME, TOO--

641
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,031
SO HAPPY FOR THEM.

642
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,034
I'M SO HAPPY AND NOT AT ALL JEALOUS.

643
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,035
OH, NO.

644
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,036
OH, GOD, DEFINITELY.

645
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,037
NOT JEALOUS.

646
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,038
MM MMM.

647
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,540

648
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,045
I MEAN, I'M PROBABLY 98% HAPPY

649
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,046
MAYBE TWO PERCENT JEALOUS...

650
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,048
AND, I MEAN, WHAT'S TWO PERCENT?

651
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,049
THAT'S NOTHING.

652
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,050
TOTALLY.

653
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,051
NOTHING.

654
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,052

655
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,053

656
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,054
I'M LIKE 90/10.

657
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,056
YEAH, ME, TOO.

658
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,060
HEY, UH...

659
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,565
HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN CHANDLER?

660
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,070
WELL, NO, BUT YOU KNOW WHO DID STOP IN HERE

661
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,071
LOOKING FOR YOU?

662
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,574
UM, TENNILLE.

663
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,582
SO, THAT MARRIAGE STUFF

664
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,584
THAT YOU WERE SAYING YESTERDAY

665
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,086
YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE THAT, DO YOU?

666
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,087
SURE, I DO.

667
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,088
IN FACT, I THINK

668
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,091
THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF MARRIAGE IS UNNATURAL.

669
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,593
I MEAN, LOOK AT PIGS.

670
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,095
LET'S TAKE A SECOND HERE AND LOOK AT PIGS.

671
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,098
OKAY, PIGS DON'T MATE FOR LIFE.

672
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,600
I MEAN, A PIG CAN HAVE, LIKE

673
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,602
A HUNDRED SEXUAL PARTNERS IN A LIFE TIME

674
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,103
AND THAT'S JUST AN ORDINARY PIG

675
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,606
NOT EVEN A PIG THAT'S GOOD AT SPORTS.

676
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,612
YEAH, BUT THAT'S PIGS, NOT PEOPLE.

677
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,614
IF MARRIAGE WORKED, I'D BE ALL FOR IT

678
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,616
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE DIVORCE RATE

679
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,617
IN THIS COUNTRY IS?

680
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,118
97%.

681
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,119
WAIT A MINUTE.

682
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,622
ARE YOU HONESTLY TELLING ME

683
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:07,125
THAT THAT YOU MAY NEVER WANT TO GET MARRIED?

684
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,126
WHO'S TO SAY?

685
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,127
YOU!

686
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,129
YOU'RE TO SAY!

687
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,132
WELL, NEVER SAY NEVER, BUT, YOU KNOW, PROBABLY, UM...

688
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,634
YEAH, NEVER.

689
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,635
OH, MY GOD.

690
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,638
TH TH THEN, WHAT ARE WE EVEN DOING?

691
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,639
WHAT IS THIS?

692
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,142
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHAT IS ALL THIS PRESSURE?

693
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,645
IS THIS SOME NEW KIND OF STRATEGY?

694
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:31,650
WHY DON'T YOU PUT DOWN YOUR COPY OF THE RULES,HUH, MAN TRAP?

695
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,651
YOU KNOW WHAT?

696
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,652
I GOT TO GO.

697
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,654

698
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,155
IT'S OKAY.

699
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,657
I GOT A PLAN.

700
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,164
WE'RE GOING TO FIND LOVE.

701
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,165
DEFINITELY.

702
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,169
YEAH, I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT ABOUT THAT.

703
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,671
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO EASY

704
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,674
FOR ME TO BE 80% HAPPY FOR MONICA AND CHANDLER.

705
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,177
IT'D BE NICE TO HAVE A LITTLE GUARANTEE, THOUGH.

706
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,679
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

707
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,181
WELL, YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE MAKE DEALS WITH A FRIEND

708
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,183
LIKE, IF NEITHER OF THEM ARE MARRIED

709
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,686
BY THE TIME THEY'RE 40, THEY MARRY EACH OTHER.

710
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,187
YOU MEAN A BACKUP?

711
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:09,688
YEAH, EXACTLY.

712
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,690
YEAH, YEAH, I'VE GOT THAT.

713
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,191
YOU DO?

714
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,192
MM HMM.

715
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,193
WHO?

716
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,194
JOEY.

717
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,195
JOEY?

718
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,196
YEAH.

719
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,698
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

720
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,199
YEAH, I LOCKED HIM IN YEARS AGO.

721
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,705
WAIT, SO, IF NEITHER OF YOU ARE MARRIED

722
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,206
BY THE TIME YOU'RE 40

723
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,708
YOU'RE GOING TO MARRY JOEY?

724
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,209
YEP, WE SHOOK ON IT.

725
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,711
YEAH... BUT BELIEVE ME

726
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,214
THAT IS NOT HOW HE WANTED TO SEAL THE DEAL.

727
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,716
OH. SERIOUSLY?

728
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,717
OH, YEAH.

729
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,719
I THINK HIS EXACT WORDS WERE...

730
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,721

731
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,223
CHARMING.

732
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,725
AH, HE'S JUST A BACKUP.

733
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,226
YEAH.

734
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,235
HEY, MONICA.

735
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,738
HAVE YOU SEEN RACHEL... OR A MIRROR?

736
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,740
THIS IS FOR MY BOAT.

737
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,241
PRETTY COOL, HUH?

738
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,243
YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

739
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,745
WHOA, WHOA, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

740
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,746
TALK TO THE CAPTAIN.

741
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,748
I'M JUST HAVING ONE OF THOSE DAYS

742
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,251
WHERE YOU REALIZE YOU'RE IN A DEAD END RELATIONSHIP.

743
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,253
CHANDLER GIVING YOU A HARD TIME, HUH?

744
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,255
IT'S NOT LIKE I WANT TO GET MARRIED TOMORROW.

745
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,256
IT'S JUST I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE

746
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,759
THAT I'M IN A RELATIONSHIP THAT'S GOING SOMEWHERE

747
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,260
THAT I'M NOT JUST WASTING MY TIME.

748
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,261
WELL, YOU KNOW CHANDLER.

749
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,263
NO, I DON'T KNOW CHANDLER...

750
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,264
NOT ANYMORE.

751
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,265
IT'S LIKE...

752
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,768
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING'S CHANGED.

753
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,269
MAYBE YOU CHANGED.

754
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,271
I DIDN'T CHANGE.

755
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,774
MAYBE THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

756
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,276
WHAT?

757
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,278
CHANDLER IS A COMPLEX FELLOW

758
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,782
ONE WHO IS UNLIKELY TO TAKE A WIFE.

759
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,785
IS THAT SOME KIND OF BOAT TALK?

760
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,286
I DON'T KNOW.

761
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,289
I HAVEN'T TOTALLY DECIDED HOW TO TALK ON MY BOAT YET.

762
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,292
WELL, WHAT DOES HE THINK?

763
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,295
DOES HE THINK I'M JUST GOING TO WAIT AROUND FOR NOTHING?

764
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,799
MONICA, FACE IT, CHANDLER IS AGAINST MARRIAGE

765
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,801
AN AND ALWAYS WILL BE.

766
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,803
YEAH, WELL, THERE'S SOME PEOPLE

767
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,304
WHO DO WANT TO MARRY ME.

768
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,305
THERE ARE?

769
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,307
YEAH-- RICHARD.

770
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,810
RI RI RICHARD SAID HE WANTS TO MARRY YOU?

771
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,311
MM HMM.

772
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,313
CHANDLER'S TELLING YOU HOW MUCH HE HATES MARRIAGE?

773
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,314
THAT'S RIGHT.

774
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,317
CHANDLER LOVES MARRIAGE!

775
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,321
YOU JUST TOLD ME THAT HE HATES MARRIAGE

776
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:27,325
TH THAT HE'S A... A COMPLEX FELLOW WHO'S UNLIKELY TO TAKE A WIFE

777
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,827
TH THAT HE'S AGAINST MARRIAGE

778
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,328
AND ALWAYS WILL BE.

779
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,831
YOU GOT THAT FROM WHAT I SAID?

780
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,836

781
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,839
 When the Cretaceous period ended

782
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,841
the dinosaurs were gone.

783
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,844
WHAT HAPPENED, YOU GUYS?

784
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,846

785
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,351
RACH?

786
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,854
HEY, YOU.

787
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,855
HEY.

788
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,356
COME ON IN. OH, THANK YOU.

789
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,860
HEY, YOU KNOW, I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOU AND ELIZABETH.

790
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:02,861
OH, THANKS.

791
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,362
YEAH, I REALLY THOUGHT

792
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,864
WE'D BE ABLE TO MAKE IT WORK

793
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,366
BUT, UH... I GUESS IT JUST WASN'T MEANT TO BE.

794
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,367
YEAH.

795
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,368
LOVE...

796
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,371
IT'S A TRICKY BUSINESS, ISN'T IT?

797
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,874
I GUESS SO.

798
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,876
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY WE MAKE A PACT--

799
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,378
IF YOU AND I ARE BOTH SINGLE BY THE TIME WE'RE 40

800
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,880
WE GET MARRIED.

801
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,382
I MEAN, WE KNOW EACH OTHER, WE LIKE EACH OTHER...

802
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,384
I MEAN, WE'VE ALREADY SLEPT TOGETHER.

803
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,887
SO, YOU KNOW, THERE'LL BE NO SURPRISES THERE.

804
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,388
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

805
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,389
NO, LIKE, WHAT'S THAT?

806
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,891

807
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,392
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

808
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:38,396
OH, YOU... YOU WANT ME TO BE YOUR BACKUP?

809
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,397
EXACTLY.

810
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,399
OH, YEAH... I ALREADY HAVE ONE.

811
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,902
WHAT? WHO?

812
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:44,402
PHOEBE.

813
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,403
PHOEBE?

814
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,404
WAIT A MINUTE.

815
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,906
BUT SHE... BUT SHE JUST...

816
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,407
SHE SAID JOEY IS HER BACKUP.

817
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,410
: OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

818
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,412
ROSS, I JUST HAD A CONVERSATION WITH HER

819
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,414
AND SHE SAID THAT SHE AND JOEY MADE A DEAL.

820
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:57,916
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

821
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,918
I MEAN, WE HAVE HAD A DEAL FOR YEARS.

822
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,419
WE WE WE SHOOK ON IT...

823
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,923
ALTHOUGH, BELIEVE ME, SHE WANTED TO DO A LOT MORE THAN THAT.

824
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,927
HEY, GUNTHER, IT'S JOEY.

825
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:09,928
IS CHANDLER THERE?

826
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:10,929

827
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,430
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.

828
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,433
WHAT KIND OF MUFFINS DO THEY SERVE AT SEA?

829
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,435
OH!

830
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,437
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?!

831
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:23,441
I WAS MAKING A COCONUT PHONE WITH THE PROFESSOR.

832
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,442

833
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,446
RICHARD TOLD MONICA HE WANTS TO MARRY HER.

834
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,447
WHAT? YEAH, YEAH.

835
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,448
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND YOU

836
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:31,950
TO TELL YOU STOP MESSING WITH HER

837
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,451
AND MAYBE I WOULD HAVE

838
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,954
IF THESE DAMN BOAT SHOES WOULDN'T KEEP FLYING OFF!

839
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,455
OH, MY GOD.

840
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,957
I KNOW, THEY SUCK!

841
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,459
HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO ASK MY GIRLFRIEND TO MARRY HIM.

842
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,961
I'M SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.

843
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:43,962
I KNOW!

844
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:44,963
WELL, WHAT...

845
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,464
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO?

846
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,967
I'M GOING TO GO OVER THERE, I'M GOING TO KICK HIS ASS!

847
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,468
WILL YOU HELP ME?

848
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,473
LOOK, CHANDLER, I DON'T THINK US GETTING OUR ASSES KICKED

849
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,475
IS A SOLUTION, OKAY?

850
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,477
JUST GO AND FIND MONICA.

851
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:00,979
YOU'RE RIGHT. OKAY. YEAH.

852
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,480
I'M GOING TO GET THE RING.

853
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,982
I'M GOING TO GET THE RING.

854
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:04,983
I'M GOING TO GO FIND HER

855
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,985
AND I'M JUST GOING TO PROPOSE.

856
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:07,986
OKAY. OKAY, GO GET HER.

857
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:08,987
DUDE, DUDE, DUDE.

858
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:09,988
HUH?

859
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:10,989
LET ME KNOW

860
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,490
ABOUT THAT COCONUT PHONE.

861
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,492
IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR THE BOAT.

862
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,999

863
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,007
HI.

864
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,011
HI.

865
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,515
I DON'T WHY I'M HERE.

866
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,018
I DIDN'T ASK.

867
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,021
YOU WANT TO COME IN?

868
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,523
I DON'T KNOW.

869
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,524
OH, OKAY.

870
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,027
WELL, I'LL JUST LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN

871
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,529
AND GO SIT ON THE COUCH.

872
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,034
CHANDLER IS SUCH AN IDIOT.

873
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,535
DRINK?

874
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,538
YEAH. I'LL HAVE A SCOTCH ON THE...

875
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,539
ROCKS WITH A TWIST?

876
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,542
I REMEMBER.

877
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,046
YOU STILL SMOKING CIGARS?

878
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,547
UH...

879
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,050
NO, NO. THAT'S ART.

880
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,054
IF IT BOTHERS YOU, I CAN PUT MY ART OUT.

881
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:20,558
NO, THAT'S OKAY.

882
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,560
SO, MONICA...

883
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,563
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

884
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,565
YOU KNOW, SINCE WE BROKE UP

885
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,567
DO YOU EVER... THINK ABOUT ME?

886
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,072
YEAH, ACTUALLY, I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.

887
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,073
OH, REALLY?

888
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,574
YEAH, BUT IT'S BECAUSE

889
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,575
I HAD A EYE EXAM

890
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,578
AND I DON'T LIKE MY NEW EYE DOCTOR.

891
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,080
WHO IS IT?

892
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,081
EDWARD NEVSKY.

893
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,582
YEAH, HE'S NO GOOD.

894
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:52,590
DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT ME IN A NON EYE DOCTOR WAY?

895
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,092
NO.

896
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,595
AH.

897
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,097
BECAUSE GETTING OVER YOU

898
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,600
IS THE HARDEST THING THAT I'VE EVER HAD TO DO

899
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,103
AND I NEVER LET MYSELF THINK ABOUT YOU.

900
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:09,107

901
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,613
PHOEBE, YOU PICKED JOEY AND ROSS?

902
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,615
YOU CANNOT HAVE TWO BACKUPS!

903
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,117
OF COURSE I CAN.

904
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,120
IT'S JUST GOOD SENSE TO BACK UP YOUR BACKUP.

905
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,622
LOOK, I'VE ALREADY LOST CHANDLER.

906
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:25,623
WHAT?

907
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,126
HEY, PHOEBE

908
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,627
WE'RE BOTH YOUR BACKUP?

909
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,130
PHOEBE, HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?

910
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,133
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT NOW.

911
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,135
YOU WERE BOTH AWARE OF THE SITUATION.

912
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,137
NO, WE WEREN'T. I WAS NOT!

913
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,140
OKAY, THIS KIND OF BACK TALK IS NOT GOING TO FLY

914
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,141
WHEN WE'RE MARRIED.

915
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,143
PHOEBE, YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH OF THEM.

916
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,644
YOU HAVE TO PICK ONE.

917
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,645
PICK ME!

918
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,646
NO, PICK ME!

919
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,649
I DON'T WANT TO END UP AN OLD MAID.

920
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,651
ALL RIGHT. WELL, LET'S SEE.

921
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:58,156
ROSS IS A GOOD FATHER, BUT JOEY HAS A BOAT.

922
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,657
THIS IS HARD.

923
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:00,658
THIS IS CRAZY.

924
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,160
LOOK, I WANT TO SWITCH TO RACHEL.

925
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,162
OOH, I WANT TO SWITCH TO RACHEL, TOO.

926
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,663
NO, JUST WAIT!

927
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,664
YOU GUYS

928
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,665
WAIT, GUYS.

929
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,168
DON'T MAKE ANY RASH DECISIONS, OKAY?

930
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,170
JUST REMEMBER MY PROMISE:

931
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,673
IF WE GET MARRIED, THREE TIMES A WEEK.

932
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,175
OH, MY GOD, PHOEBE.

933
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,177
I'M TALKING ABOUT MASSAGES.

934
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,678
OH, ALL RIGHT.

935
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,180

936
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,684
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

937
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,685
I KNOW HOW TO SETTLE THIS.

938
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,188
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.

939
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,190
I'M GOING TO WRITE "JOEY" ON ONE NAPKIN

940
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,193
AND I'M GOING TO WRITE "ROSS" ON THE OTHER NAPKIN

941
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,195
AND WE ARE GOING TO PICK ONE

942
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,697
AND THAT PERSON IS GOING TO BE OUR BACKUP, OKAY?

943
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,698
HERE WE GO.

944
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,200
THAT SOUNDS FAIR. FINE.

945
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,201
GOOD.

946
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,702
WOO OO!

947
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,206
PICK ONE.

948
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,208
LEFT.

949
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,209
THANK YOU.

950
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,210
YOU'RE WELCOME.

951
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:55,713
"ROSS."

952
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,215
"JOEY."

953
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,716
HMM.

954
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,717
WE SHOULD JUST SWITCH.

955
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,719
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

956
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,224
I MISSED YOU

957
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,726
YOU UGLY, FLAT FACED OLD FREAK.

958
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,231
EXCUSE ME?

959
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,733
OH, NO. HIM.

960
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,735
OH. WHEW.

961
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,239
I MISS THIS APARTMENT.

962
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,242
NOW, THIS IS A GROWN UP'S APARTMENT.

963
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,743
I SHOULD BE WITH A GROWN UP.

964
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,245
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

965
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:31,749
YEAH. YOU'RE SAYING YOU NEED TO BE WITH SOMEONE MORE MATURE.

966
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,251
MAYBE SOMEONE WITH

967
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:37,255
A LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE...

968
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,257
OR A MUSTACHE.

969
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,758
YOU KNOW, LET'S FACE IT.

970
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,260
I'M NOT A KID ANYMORE.

971
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,761
I NEED TO BE WITH SOMEONE

972
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,763
WHO WANTS THE SAME THINGS THAT I DO.

973
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,265
COMING TO MY PLACE OF WORK

974
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,267
AND TELLING ME THAT YOU LOVE ME--

975
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,768
I WANT THAT!

976
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,271
TALKING ABOUT PIG SEX OVER LUNCH--

977
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,773
I DON'T WANT THAT!

978
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,276
I THINK THAT'S FAIR.

979
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,779
"FAIR"? PLEASE, DON'T EVEN TALK TO ME ABOUT FAIR.

980
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,780
FAIR WOULD HAVE BEEN

981
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,283
YOU WANTING TO MARRY ME BACK THEN.

982
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,784
OR FAIR WOULD BE CHANDLER WANTING

983
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,286
TO MARRY ME NOW.

984
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,787
BELIEVE ME, NOTHING ABOUT THIS IS FAIR.

985
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,289
NOTHING, NOTHING.

986
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,791
NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING!

987
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:17,795
IT'S OKAY. SHH, SHH. HEY, HEY, SHH.

988
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,797
NOTHING.

989
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,304
I DON'T KNOW.

990
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,307
I DON'T KNOW. UM...

991
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:30,308
I KNOW.

992
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:34,812
I I...

993
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:38,316
I HAVE TO FIGURE SOME, YOU KNOW, SOME STUFF

994
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,817
BEFORE I CAN...

995
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,819
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

996
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,822
TAKE AS MUCH TIME AS YOU WANT.

997
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,825
TEN, EVEN 20 MINUTES IF YOU NEED IT.

998
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,329
I'LL BE HERE...

999
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,330
NOT SMOKING.

1000
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,338

1001
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:08,346
CHANDLER.

1002
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,848
WHERE IS SHE?

1003
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,850
I'M NOT SCARED OF YOU.

1004
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,855
SHE'S NOT HERE AND PLEASE COME IN.

1005
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,858
SCOTCH ON THE ROCKS, WITH A TWIST...

1006
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,360
ON A COASTER--

1007
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,361

1008
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,362
MONICA? MONICA?

1009
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:28,866
OKAY, SHE WAS HERE, BUT SHE LEFT.

1010
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,368
WHERE DID SHE GO?

1011
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,870
WELL, SHE SAID SHE HAD TO THINK THINGS OVER.

1012
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,372
OH, MY GOD.

1013
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,373
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS, YOU KNOW?

1014
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,875
I THOUGHT... I THOUGHT YOU WERE A GOOD GUY.

1015
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,877
OH, HEY, LOOK, NOTHING HAPPENED.

1016
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,379
NOTHING HAPPENED? NOTHING?

1017
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,881
SO YOU DIDN'T TELL MY GIRLFRIEND THAT YOU LOVE HER?

1018
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,884
WELL, ALL RIGHT, ONE THING HAPPENED.

1019
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,886
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

1020
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:49,887
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID?

1021
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,390
MY GIRLFRIEND IS OUT THERE THINKING THINGS OVER.

1022
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,891
YOU MADE MY GIRLFRIEND THINK!

1023
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:57,395
WELL, I'M SORRY.

1024
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,897
WHAT DOES SHE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT?

1025
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,399
I LOVE HER.

1026
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,401
WELL, APPARENTLY I'M WILLING TO OFFER HER THINGS

1027
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,902
THAT YOU ARE NOT.

1028
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,904
BUT I AM WILLING TO OFFER HER ALL THOSE THINGS.

1029
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,406
THIS WAS JUST A PLAN, YOU KNOW?

1030
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,907
A WAY TO THROW HER OFF COURSE

1031
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,909
SO THAT WHEN I OFFERED HER ALL THESE THINGS

1032
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:12,910
SHE'D BE SURPRISED.

1033
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:17,415
WELL, IF IT HELPS, IT WORKED VERY WELL.

1034
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,417
WELL, IT WAS WORKING UNTIL YOU SHOWED UP

1035
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:23,421
YOU BIG TREE.

1036
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,923
I MEAN, THIS ISN'T FAIR.

1037
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,425
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE WITH HER.

1038
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,427
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE AND YOU BLEW IT!

1039
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,430
AND THIS IS MY CHANCE AND I'M NOT GOING TO BLOW IT

1040
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,932
BECAUSE WE ARE MEANT FOR EACH OTHER.

1041
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,935
AND THIS HAS ALL JUST BEEN ONE STUPID MISTAKE.

1042
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,439
I WAS GOING TO PROPOSE TONIGHT.

1043
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,942
YOU WERE GOING TO PROPOSE?

1044
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:49,447
YEAH, I EVEN... GOT A RING.

1045
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,949
DID YOU GET A RING?

1046
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,951
NO, I DON'T HAVE A RING.

1047
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,458
YOU GO GET HER, CHANDLER.

1048
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,964
AND CAN I GIVE YOU A PIECE OF ADVICE?

1049
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,467
IF YOU DO GET HER...

1050
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,469
DON'T LET HER GO.

1051
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,970
TRUST ME.

1052
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,475
YOU KNOW, RICHARD...

1053
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,477
YOU ARE A GOOD GUY.

1054
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,482
I KNOW.

1055
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,983
I HATE THAT.

1056
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:39,997
DUDE...

1057
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,999
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU NOW. I GOT TO FIND MONICA.

1058
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,000
SHE'S GONE.

1059
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,501
WHAT?

1060
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:44,502
SHE'S GONE.

1061
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,504
SHE HAD A BAG AND SHE LEFT.

1062
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,005
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1063
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,006
SHE WAS ALL CRYING.

1064
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,509
SHE SAID YOU GUYS WANT DIFFERENT THINGS

1065
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,010
AND THAT SHE NEEDED TIME TO THINK.

1066
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,012
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HER IT WAS A PLAN?

1067
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,014
I DID. I TOLD HER EVERYTHING, CHANDLER

1068
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,516
BUT SHE WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME.

1069
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,017
WELL, WHERE...?

1070
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,519
WHERE DID SHE GO?

1071
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,520
TO HER PARENTS, I THINK

1072
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,021
AND SHE SAID THAT YOU SHOULDN'T CALL HER

1073
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,524
BUT IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD.

1074
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,026
I CAN'T BELIEVE I RUINED THIS.

1075
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,029
I AM SO SORRY, MAN.

1076
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,032
DAMN.

1077
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,042
YOU WANTED IT TO BE A SURPRISE.

1078
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,054
OH, MY GOD.

1079
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:48,065
CHANDLER, IN ALL MY LIFE

1080
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:53,070
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE SO LUCKY...

1081
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:59,577
: AS TO FALL IN LOVE WITH MY BEST...

1082
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,079
MY BEST...

1083
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,081
THERE'S A REASON WHY GIRLS DON'T DO THIS!

1084
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,583
OKAY, OKAY.

1085
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,584
I'LL DO IT.

1086
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:14,091
I THOUGHT...

1087
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,092
I CAN DO THIS.

1088
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,596

1089
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:23,601
I THOUGHT THAT IT MATTERED WHAT I SAID

1090
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,103
OR WHERE I SAID IT.

1091
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:29,106
THEN I REALIZED

1092
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:36,113
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS THAT YOU...

1093
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,115
YOU MAKE ME HAPPIER

1094
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,117
THAN I EVER THOUGHT I COULD BE.

1095
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,122
AND IF YOU LET ME

1096
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,124
I WILL SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE

1097
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,126
TRYING TO MAKE YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY.

1098
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,637
MONICA...

1099
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,141
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

1100
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,145
YES.

1101
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:24,161
I KNEW YOU WERE LIKELY TO TAKE A WIFE!

1102
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,666
 CAN WE COME IN YET?!

1103
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,667
WE'RE DYING OUT HERE!

1104
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,670
