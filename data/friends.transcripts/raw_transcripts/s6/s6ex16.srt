566
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,342
Not so fast, Wesley.

567
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,345
Ramoray.

568
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,347
That's right, Wesley.

569
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,350
I just stopped by to say that...

570
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,852
you're not a real doctor...

571
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,854
and that woman's brain...

572
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,855
is fine.

573
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,357
OH, THANK GOD!

574
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,858
OH, THANK GOD.

575
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,866
Hope.

576
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,369
Hope.

577
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,870
Drake.

578
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,372
You're not dying, Hope.

579
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,375
You're going to live a long, healthy life...

580
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,376
with me.

581
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,378
Oh, Drake.

582
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,386
OKAY. HERE WE GO.

583
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,388
OKAY.

584
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,389

585
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:11,890
MM...

586
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,393
HI, JOEY.

587
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,395
IT'S RACHEL.

588
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,398
UM, I AM FREE TOMORROW NIGHT.

589
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,902
YEAH, SURE. SURE, I COULD BRING SOME SANDWICHES.

590
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,913
SO, HONEY, THIS, UH...

591
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,415
THIS THREESOME THING, UH

592
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,917
I MEAN, HOW ARE WE EVEN GOING TO START TO FIND...

593
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,420
ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN MAKING A LIST OF ALL THE WOMEN I KNOW

594
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,921
WHO MIGHT BE INTO DOING THIS.

595
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,925
OH. WOW.

596
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:49,928
HUH?

597
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,432
BOY.

598
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,436
WOW, SOMEONE'S BEEN DOING THEIR HOMEWORK.

599
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,937
YEAH.

600
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,940
OH, AND I KNOW GAIL ROSTEN IS IN THERE TWICE

601
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,941
BUT SHE IS SO...

602
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,943
OH, I KNOW.

603
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,948
YOU KNOW, JUST, JUST TALKING ABOUT IT IS...

604
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,949
GETTING ME KIND OF...

605
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,451
I KNOW, ME, TOO.

606
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,452
YEAH?

607
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,953
WELL, I THINK BEN'S ASLEEP.

608
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,955
OH, UM...

609
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,459
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'LL BE BETTER

610
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,961
IF WE JUST SAVE IT.

611
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:23,962
YEAH.

612
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,467
RIGHT. SAVE IT-- I CAN DO THAT.

613
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,969

614
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,977
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS WEAR THAT DUMB HAT?

615
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,979
WHAT, ARE YOU LATE FOR YOUR PAPER ROUTE?

616
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,982
: HI, MR. AND MRS. JONES.

617
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,984
HERE'S YOUR PAPER. I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR WINDOW.

618
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,986
OH, I'M... EH...

619
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:51,990
HEY, PHEEBS.

620
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,991
HEY.

621
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,992
HOW'S IT GOING?

622
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,494
WELL, I GOT TO GET OUT OF THIS BED!

623
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,995
I'M GOING CRAZY HERE!

624
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,497
CRAZY!

625
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,498
HERE YOU GO, SWEETIE.

626
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,000
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS, HERBAL TEA?

627
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,001
I HATE HERBAL TEA.

628
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,504
I PUT SOME HONEY IN IT.

629
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,506
NYI, NYI, HONEY IN IT.

630
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,510
SHE DOESN'T KNOW SHE WAS FIRED YET, DOES SHE?

631
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,512
NO. THE DOCTORS SAY IT MAY KILL HER.

632
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,014
WHAT ARE YOU TWO GIRLS WHISPERING ABOUT OVER THERE?

633
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,018
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD TELL HER.

634
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,522
LOOK, PHEEBS, MAYBE THIS WHOLE HEART ATTACK THING IS A SIGN

635
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,524
THAT YOU SHOULD START THINKING ABOUT

636
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,025
GETTING A DIFFERENT JOB.

637
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,027
OKAY, WHAT IS THIS, A STUPID CONTEST?

638
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,029
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A WINNER HERE!

639
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,531
LOOK, PHOEBE, HE'S RIGHT.

640
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,534
PEOPLE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE HEART ATTACKS AT 31.

641
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,035
I KNOW, BUT IF I DIDN'T WORK THERE

642
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,537
WHAT ELSE WOULD I DO?

643
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,038
YOU USED TO LIKE PLAYING THE GUITAR.

644
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,540
YEAH, THAT WAS LUCRATIVE.

645
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,041
SMART, LIKE YOUR BROTHER.

646
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,544
UH, WHAT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE MASSAGE THING.

647
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,546
THAT NEVER GAVE YOU A HEART ATTACK.

648
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,048
HMM, PULLING IN A SALARY IN THE HIGH SIX FIGURES

649
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,551
OR RUBBING GROSS, NAKED PEOPLE FOR CHUMP CHANGE.

650
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,052
OOH, WHAT DO I DO?

651
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,053
WHAT WILL I DO?!

652
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,561
I MEAN, IT'S JUST SO REALISTIC.

653
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,563
YEAH, I KNOW.

654
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,565
HIS NAME'S PAT.

655
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,066
PAT THE DOG.

656
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,069
OH! OH! I GET IT!

657
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,571

658
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,072
OH, GOD.

659
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,577
ARE YOU, UH, YOU...

660
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,078
READY FOR A REFILL?

661
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,080
OH, I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T.

662
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,082
SO I WILL!

663
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,588
OH... WOW.

664
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,089
IT'S LIKE IT'S RAINING.

665
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,591
PRETTY COOL, HUH?

666
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,093
BUT IF YOU'RE THINKING YOU COULD PUT A FISH IN THERE

667
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,596
AND IT WOULDN'T GET SUCKED UP INTO THE MECHANISM

668
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,597
WELL, YOU'D BE WRONG.

669
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,600
UM, CAN I USE YOUR BATHROOM?

670
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,101
IT'S, UH, RIGHT THROUGH THERE.

671
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,603
OKAY.

672
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,104

673
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,106
YOU KNOW, I GOT TO TELL YOU

674
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,108
IF SOMEONE TOLD ME A WEEK AGO

675
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:54,112
THAT I WOULD BE PEEING IN JOEY TRIBBIANI'S APARTMENT...

676
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,614
YEAH, LIFE'S PRETTY GREAT, ISN'T IT?

677
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,115
IT IS; IT REALLY IS.

678
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,117
OH, GEE! OH! WHOO!

679
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,620

680
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,625
I HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY.

681
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,628
WE'RE STARTING WITH OYSTERS.

682
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,130
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT OYSTERS, DON'T YOU?

683
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,633
THEY HAVE PARASITES?

684
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,635
NO.

685
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,138
UM, WELL, SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT OYSTERS ARE...

686
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,640
AN APHRODISIAC.

687
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,642
WHAT PEOPLE?

688
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,643
PEOPLE.

689
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,646
PEOPLE SAY IT.

690
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,147
COME HERE.

691
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,652
SO, OYSTERS, HUH?

692
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,153

693
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,655
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

694
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,156
A LITTLE MIDDLE EASTERN COUSCOUS.

695
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,659
SOMETHING WE CAN EAT WITH OUR HANDS.

696
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,160
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY

697
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,663
WHEN WE WERE STUDYING COMMUNICABLE DISEASES...

698
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,665
NO, NO, NO, NO.

699
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,166
IT'S SENSUAL.

700
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,668
OH. DIDN'T KNOW. OKAY.

701
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,669
OKAY.

702
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,671

703
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,672
OH, NO!

704
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,174
I'M SORRY, SWEETIE, IT'S THE HOSPITAL.

705
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,177
THAT FOOD LOOKS GREAT. MAYBE SAVE ME SOME?

706
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,179
I CAN'T PROMISE ANYTHING.

707
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,191
WE'RE REALLY GOING TO DO THIS, HUH?

708
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,194
LOOKS LIKE IT.

709
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,697
YOU KNOW, IF... IF THIS IS TOO WEIRD FOR YOU

710
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,699
YOU CAN STILL BACK OUT, ANYTIME...

711
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,200
 I GOT IT.

712
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,202
OKAY.

713
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,704
SUSAN, HI.

714
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,205
HEY.

715
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,208
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.

716
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,210
I WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED IT FOR THE WORLD.

717
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,715
I'M I'M ROSS, BY THE WAY.

718
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,216
HELLO, ROSS.

719
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,220
I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THIS SPACE.

720
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,722
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

721
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,728
HOW HOT IS THIS?!

722
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,734
I'M SORRY YOU'RE HERE WITH ME

723
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,235
INSTEAD OF ROGER.

724
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,236
YEAH, ME, TOO.

725
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,241
WELL, I COULD MAKE IT SEEM LIKE HE'S HERE.

726
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,244
HERE'S SOME LITTLE KNOWN FACTS ABOUT COUSCOUS:

727
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,249
THEY DIDN'T ADD THE SECOND COUS UNTIL 1979.

728
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,252

729
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,754
STOP IT! THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

730
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,255
OKAY.

731
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,757
I'M SORRY, OKAY.

732
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,259
IT'S JUST, TONIGHT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE, YOU KNOW...

733
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,761
WELL, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A BIG DEAL.

734
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,262
WHAT WAS TONIGHT?

735
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,764
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT TONIGHT WAS.

736
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,765
OKAY.

737
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,268
WHAT WAS TONIGHT?

738
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,272
WELL, TONIGHT WAS...

739
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,274
WAS GOING TO BE MY FIRST TIME.

740
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:36,775
WITH ROGER?

741
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,279
NOT JUST WITH ROGER?

742
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,281
OH, MY GOD!

743
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,284
ALL RIGHT, RELAX, MR. I'VE HAD SEX FOUR TIMES!

744
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,289
FOUR DIFFERENT WOMEN.

745
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,792
I'VE HAD SEX WAY MORE TIMES.

746
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,793
HOW MANY?

747
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,795
NINE.

748
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:01,299
I WAS WAITING FOR THE PERFECT GUY, YOU KNOW.

749
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,801
WELL, GOOD. GOOD FOR YOU.

750
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,804
YOU REALLY THINK THAT ROGER IS THE PERFECT GUY?

751
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,307
NO. HE'S NOT A HORRIBLE GUY.

752
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,810
HEY, THAT'S WHAT I TELL GIRLS ABOUT ME.

753
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,813
CHANDLER, I'M GOING TO DIE A VIRGIN!

754
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,314
NO, YOU ARE NOT.

755
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,816
YOU ARE SWEET AND WONDERFUL

756
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,818
AND THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN FOR YOU.

757
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,819
REALLY? WHEN?

758
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,821
YOU WANT TO DO IT WITH ME?

759
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,321
OKAY.

760
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,827
I WAS KIDDING.

761
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,830
SO WAS I.

762
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,837
JOEY...

763
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,339
YOU'RE SUCH AN AMAZING ACTOR.

764
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:47,345
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE DR. DRAKE RAMORAY LEAVES OFF

765
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,848
AND JOEY TRIBBIANI BEGINS?

766
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,851
WELL, WITH DR. DRAKE

767
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,854
THEY ALWAYS TELL ME WHAT TO SAY.

768
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:02,861
AND WITH JOEY, I PRETTY MUCH HAVE TO MAKE IT UP ON MY OWN.

769
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,862
WOW.

770
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,363
HMM.

771
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,865
TELL ME SOMETHING, JOEY...

772
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,866
WHOA!

773
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,867
OOP, OOP!

774
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,370
I JUST FELL RIGHT OFF THE COUCH THERE.

775
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,371
YEAH, YOU DID.

776
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:14,873
I'M OKAY.

777
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,374
OKAY, HERE YOU GO. WHOOPS.

778
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,876
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

779
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,877
YEAH?

780
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,880
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME SOMEONE TOLD YOU

781
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,382
JUST HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE?

782
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,885
WOW.

783
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,887
I CAN'T... I CAN'T FEEL MY HANDS.

784
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,890
OH, WELL, COME HERE.

785
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,394
HUH?

786
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:37,395
HUH?

787
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,396
OOH?

788
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:39,898
OOH?

789
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,913

790
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,421
WE CAN'T DO THIS.

791
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:04,422
NO.

792
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:05,924

793
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:06,925
OYSTER?

794
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,426
YEAH.

795
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,429
OKAY, NOW, IF,IF, IF WE DID DO THIS

796
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,932
THERE'D BE A LOT OF PRESSURE ON ME, YOU KNOW?

797
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,434
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A VERY LONG TIME

798
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,436
AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

799
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,939
YEAH, BUT SEE, I HAVE NOTHING TO COMPARE IT TO.

800
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,441
SO EVEN IF YOU WERE HORRIBLE, HOW WOULD I KNOW?

801
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,945
I DO LIKE THAT.

802
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:27,946
IT'S HARDER FOR ME--

803
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,948
I'VE GOT THOSE FOUR OTHER WOMEN TO COMPETE WITH.

804
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,450
WELL, IF IT HELPS, THERE WERE ONLY THREE.

805
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,954
SO, IT WOULD JUST BE FOR TONIGHT, RIGHT?

806
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,956
ABSOLUTELY. IT WOULD JUST BE ONE FRIEND

807
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,457
HELPING OUT ANOTHER FRIEND.

808
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,960
STOP IT. WE'RE NOT DOING THIS.

809
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,461
LET'S DO IT.

810
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,462
NO. OKAY!

811
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,463
OKAY!

812
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:47,966
SO, UM...

813
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,970
DO YOU HAVE ANY, UH, MOVES?

814
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,974
I HAVE SOME MOVES.

815
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,976
I HAVE NO MOVES.

816
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,477
OKAY.

817
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,480
OKAY, WHAT YOU DOING THERE?!

818
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,984
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M SORRY, THIS IS JUST TOO WEIRD.

819
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:06,985
YEAH, LET'S JUST FORGET IT.

820
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,987
YEAH. WHAT IF I TURN OUT THE LIGHTS?

821
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:09,988
OKAY.

822
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,995
 OH, YEAH.

823
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:17,996
CHANDLER?

824
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,999
: YEAH?

825
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,501
THAT'S THE COUCH.

826
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,007
I KNOW.
