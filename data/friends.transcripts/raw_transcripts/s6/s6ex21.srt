1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:02,502
OKAY, CHANDLER...

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:03,503
OKAY.

3
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,505
AND YOUR HOROSCOPE SAYS

4
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,007
"ON THE FIFTH, A SPECIAL SOMEONE

5
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,009
IS GOING TO GIVE YOU A GIFT."

6
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,511
OH. WELL, THANK YOU IN ADVANCE.

7
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,514
OH, BUT THE 12th BRINGS A LOVERS' SPAT.

8
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,517
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A JOKE ABOUT MY SPECIAL PRESENT.

9
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,519
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,522
OH, WAIT. AND ON THE 19th

11
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,525
"A SECRET CRUSH ANNOUNCES ITSELF."

12
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,532
HEY, GUYS. HEY!

13
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,034
OH, MY GOD, IT'S JOEY TRIBBIANI

14
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,535
OF MAC AND C.H.E.E.S.E.!

15
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,040
OH, THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S YOUR FIRST DAY.

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,042
SO, YOU PSYCHED TO FIGHT FAKE CRIME

17
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,043
WITH YOUR ROBOT SIDEKICK?

18
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,544
AM I PSYCHED?

19
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,546
THE LEAD IN MY OWN TV SERIES?

20
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,548
I'VE DREAMED ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS!

21
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:52,052
WHY HAVE I NOT BEEN PREPARING?

22
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,554
NO, JOEY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE GREAT.

23
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,056
BUT I GOT TO ACT WITH A ROBOT, PHEEBS

24
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,558
AND I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY.

25
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,561
I CAN'T EVEN USE CHANDLER'S COMPUTER, EXCEPT TO FIND PORN.

26
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,562
AND THAT'S ONLY

27
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,065
BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT THERE WHEN YOU TURN IT ON.

28
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,568
I THINK OUR LOVERS' SPAT

29
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,570
WILL START A LITTLE EARLY THIS MONTH.

30
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,072
I'LL BE WAITING.

40
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,616
ARE YOU JUDGING THEM BY THEIR COVERS?

41
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,119
BECAUSE YOU'RE REALLY NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.

42
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,121
NO, I'M JUST DECIDING WHICH ONE TO USE.

43
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,123
I'M GOING TO START WRITING ANOTHER BOOK.

44
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,127
B BECAUSE THE LAST ONE WAS SUCH A BIG SELLER?

45
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,130
WELL, IF YOU MUST KNOW, I HAVE WRITTEN 14 BOOKS

46
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,133
AND, AS I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS READ THEM

47
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,137
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THEY HAVE ALL BEEN VERY WELL RECEIVED.

48
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,641
BUT, YOU KNOW, I LOST ALL OF THEM IN THE FIRE.

49
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,643
SO THIS ONE... THIS ONE I'M GOING TO KEEP

50
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,146
IN AN ASBESTOS LINED BOX FAR AWAY FROM RACHEL.

51
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,649
WHO I FORGIVE.

52
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,652
HEY. HEY.

53
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,154
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING LATER?

54
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,655
OH, RACHEL AND I HAVE APPOINTMENTS

55
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,656
TO GET OUR HAIR CUT.

56
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,657
WE DO?

57
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,159
I WANT TO SEE WHAT HE WANTS FIRST.

58
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,160
OH.

59
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,661
I JUST FOUND OUT

60
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,164
ELIZABETH'S DAD WANTS TO MEET ME.

61
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,665
WAIT A MINUTE; HOLD THE PHONE--

62
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,667
YOU'RE NOT ELIZABETH'S DAD?

63
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,673
THAT'S THE ONLY ONE YOU GET.

64
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,176
AND HE HATES ME, OKAY?

65
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,677
APPARENTLY, HE ASKED ELIZABETH

66
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,679
WHY SHE WOULD WANT TO GO OUT WITH A GUY

67
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,681
WHO COULDN'T GET A GIRL HIS OWN AGE.

68
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:05,185
HUH. AND WHAT DID SHE SAY TO THAT?

69
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,187
AND THAT'S YOURS.

70
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,190
LOOK, COME ON, GUYS.

71
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,191
I REALLY WANT THIS GUY TO LIKE ME.

72
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,692
IT WOULD REALLY HELP ME OUT

73
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,693
IF YOU GUYS COULD BE HERE

74
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,695
TO KIND OF MAKE ME LOOK GOOD.

75
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,197
WE CAN BE HERE. OH, OF COURSE!

76
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,198
THANKS.

77
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,699
WE KNOW HOW TOUGH

78
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,201
THOSE PARENT TEACHER CONFERENCES CAN BE.

79
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,209
SO, HERE'S YOUR OFFICE SET.

80
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,212
WOW, HUH?

81
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,214
MAC MACHIAVELLI, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.

82
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,215
HUH?

83
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,718
OOH... HUH?

84
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,721
LOOK AT ALL THE BOOKS I'VE READ.

85
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,723
LET'S, UH, GET YOU TO WARDROBE FOR A FITTING.

86
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,725
OKAY. HEY, UH, WHEN DO I GET TO MEET THE ROBOT?

87
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,227
WHY DON'T WE DO THAT RIGHT NOW?

88
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,228
HE'S RIGHT HERE.

89
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,229
OKAY.

90
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,231
JOEY TRIBBIANI, THIS IS...

91
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,232
OH, MY... WOW!

92
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,234
HE'S SO LIFELIKE.

93
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,737
THIS IS WAYNE. UNBELIEVABLE.

94
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,739
THE MAN WHO CREATED AND OPERATES C.H.E.E.S.E.

95
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,242
HOW DO YOU DO, THERE, WAYNE?

96
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,744
I'LL LET YOU TWO GUYS GET ACQUAINTED, HUH?

97
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,745
OKAY.

98
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,247
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

99
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,249
UH, SO, WHERE'S C.H.E.E.S.E.?

100
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,252
C.H.E.E.S.E. IS RIGHT HERE.

101
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,759
NICE TO MEET YOU, MAC.

102
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,262

103
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,764
THIS IS, LIKE, THE TEMPORARY ROBOT, RIGHT?

104
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,766
NO. WHY?

105
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,268
WELL, I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE

106
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,270
LIKE, A REALLY COOL ROBOT, YOU KNOW?

107
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,271
LIKE THE TERMINATOR

108
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,273
OR, UH, WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU.

109
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,775
I SPENT TWO YEARS DEVELOPING THIS MACHINE.

110
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,278
IT'S ABSOLUTELY STATE OF THE ART.

111
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,779
I'M SORRY, IT JUST...

112
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,781
IT DOESN'T REALLY LOOK LIKE IT CAN DO ANYTHING.

113
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,782
IT CAN DO THIS.

114
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,783
WHOO!

115
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,298
THIS IS MY FATHER, PAUL STEVENS.

116
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,299
DAD, THIS IS ROSS GELLER.

117
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,302
IT IT IT'S GREAT TO MEET YOU, PAUL.

118
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,304
I USUALLY PREFER LIZ'S BOYFRIENDS

119
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,805
TO ADDRESS ME AS MR. STEVENS.

120
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,309
WELL, OF COURSE, OF COURSE, MR. STEVENS.

121
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,312
SO, ROSS...

122
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,314
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

123
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,317
EXCUSE ME?

124
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,819
WHY CAN'T YOU GET A GIRLFRIEND YOU OWN AGE?

125
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,322
OH, IT'S FUNNY.

126
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,823
UM...

127
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,825
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

128
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,828
I DON'T LIKE YOU GOING OUT WITH MY DAUGHTER, ROSS.

129
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,331
OKAY, UM... I CAN, I CAN SEE THAT.

130
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,834
UM, BUT I THINK IF YOU GIVE ME, UM, ONE CHANCE

131
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,336
I I CAN CHANGE YOUR MIND.

132
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,338
OKAY.

133
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,839
WHAT?

134
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,840
OKAY.

135
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,842
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE CHANCE TO CHANGE MY MIND.

136
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,344
YOU GOT ONE MINUTE.

137
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,347
DADDY...

138
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,349
FINE. TWO MINUTES.

139
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,850
GO.

140
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,853

141
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,355

142
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,856
A MINUTE, 50 SECONDS.

143
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,359
OKAY, UM...

144
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,860
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

145
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,862
I HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.

146
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,865
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN IN,  UM, RELATIONSHIPS IN GENERAL

147
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,368
BUT I'VE NEVER DONE IT WITH A STUDENT.

148
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,369
I MEAN, I... NOT...

149
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,373
NOT "IT"... I MEAN ... I DON'T MEAN...

150
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,874
WE HAVEN'T DONE "IT".

151
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,877
UH, WE... I MEAN, WE'VE DONE STUFF, BUT I...

152
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,880
OKAY, OKAY.

153
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,382
A JOKE, A JOKE.

154
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,883
LIGHTEN THE MOOD.

155
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,385
UM, TWO GUYS GO INTO A BAR.

156
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,886
ONE OF THEM'S IRISH...

157
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,887
I'M IRISH.

158
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,890
AND THE IRISH  GUY WINS THE JOKE.

159
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,893
ROSS! ROSS!

160
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,895
HOW CRAZY THAT WE WOULD RUN INTO YOU.

161
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,897
OH, MY GOD, THANK YOU.

162
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,402
UM, UH, MR. STEVENS, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET MY FRIENDS.

163
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,404
THIS IS PHOEBE, MONICA AND CHANDLER.

164
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,405
HI. HELLO.

165
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,406
HI, MONICA.

166
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:47,907
CHANDER.

167
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,909
CHANDLER.

168
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,911
NEVER GOING TO REMEMBER THAT.

169
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,415
WOW. SO YOU'RE ELIZABETH'S FATHER, HUH?

170
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,917
I CAN SEE NOW WHERE SHE GETS HER...

171
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,919
RUGGED HANDSOMENESS.

172
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,424
IS THERE A MRS. STEVENS?

173
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,427
THERE'S A MR. BING.

174
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,430
NO.

175
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,931
UNFORTUNATELY, LIZZY'S MOM PASSED AWAY

176
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,433
SHORTLY AFTER SHE WAS BORN.

177
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,934
I RAISED HER BY MYSELF.

178
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:15,935
OH! OH!

179
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,938
I GET THAT A LOT.

180
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,440
OKAY.

181
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,442
UM, WHY DON'T WE ALL TAKE A SEAT, YOU KNOW?

182
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,446
AND, UH, AND I'LL  GET US ALL SOME COFFEES.

183
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,947
YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU...?

184
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,449

185
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,451
UH, AND YOU GUYS CAN TALK ABOUT WHATEVER...

186
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,952
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

187
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,954
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER POPS INTO YOUR HEAD.

188
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,459
IT IS SO STRANGE SEEING ROSS HERE THIS TIME OF DAY

189
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,462
BECAUSE USUALLY, WELL, HE'S AT THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL.

190
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,963
YEAH.

191
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,965
NOT LOOKING FOR DATES.

192
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,472
SO, UH, MONICA IS ROSS'S SISTER.

193
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,474
YEAH. HE'S A GREAT BROTHER.

194
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,475
I HAD A SISTER.

195
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,476
OH.

196
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,477
SHE PASSED AWAY.

197
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,478
OH! OH!

198
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,479
OH, YOU DON'T

199
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,480
HAVE TO DO THAT EVERY TIME.

200
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,982
BUT, UH, ROSS, ROSS IS A GREAT GUY.

201
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,485
I, UH, WAS ROOMMATES WITH HIM IN COLLEGE.

202
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,487
FUNNY STORY--

203
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,491
YOUR ROOMMATE IN COLLEGE DIED, DIDN'T HE?

204
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,494
A PART OF HIM DID, YES.

205
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,997
OKAY, HERE WE ARE-- PAUL, ELIZABETH.

206
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,499
SO, I HOPE YOU GUYS

207
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,000
WERE FINDING SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.

208
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,502
YES. WE WERE JUST...

209
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,005
HI, SORRY I'M LATE, BUT I AM READY.

210
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,006
READY TO TALK YOU UP.

211
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,508
WHEN DOES LIZ'S FATHER GET HERE?

212
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,009
I'M ALREADY HERE.

213
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,010
OH!

214
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,513
ROSS IS SO GREAT.

215
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,518
HEY, PHEEBS. HEY.

216
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,019
HOW'S THE BOOK WRITING GOING?

217
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,521
REALLY WELL.

218
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,022
I'M UP TO PAGE 47.

219
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,023
WOW. WHAT ARE YOU WRITING?

220
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,024
PAGE NUMBERS.

221
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,028
HONEY, YOU GOT THE KIND WITH THE LITTLE GIRL.

222
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,030
YOU SAID WE WERE GOING TO GET THE KIND WITH THE BABY.

223
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,032
NO. YOU SAID THE BABY CREEPS YOU OUT.

224
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,534
NO. THE LITTLE GIRL CREEPS ME OUT.

225
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,535
YOU SAID THE BABY.

226
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,036
WHY WOULD THE BABY CREEP ME OUT?

227
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,538
WHY WOULD THE LITTLE GIRL

228
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,540
CREEP YOU OUT?

229
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,542
YOU GUYS, I'M SORRY, CAN YOU PLEASE TALK A LITTLE SLOWER?

230
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,043
THIS IS GOING IN YOUR BOOK?

231
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,545
YEAH. IT'S ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS.

232
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,047
YOU KNOW, THE TRAPS, THE PITFALLS, WHAT NOT TO DO.

233
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,549
KEEP GOING. THIS STUFF'S GREAT.

234
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,050
WHAT?!

235
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,552
EXCUSE ME...

236
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,053
AND HOW NONE OF IT MATTERS

237
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,055
WHEN THE PEOPLE REALLY LOVE EACH OTHER.

238
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,560
AND HOW PEOPLE WILL BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU TELL THEM

239
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,061
AS LONG AS IT'S A COMPLIMENT.

240
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:29,569
OH, HI.

241
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,571
HI. HI. HI.

242
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,073
I THINK I LEFT MY KEYS HERE SOMEWHERE.

243
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,575
OH, WELL, LET'S LOOK FOR THEM.

244
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,577
USUALLY UNDER HERE, THEY'RE...

245
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,079
OH, OH, HEY, HEY, ARE THESE THEM?

246
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,582
NO.

247
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,083
ALL RIGHT.

248
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,085
OH!

249
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,587
HERE THEY ARE RIGHT HERE.

250
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,588
OH, GOOD.

251
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,589
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

252
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,590
YEAH... WAIT!

253
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,591
OH, SORRY, MR. PAUL, MR. PAUL.

254
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,593
JUST CALL ME PAUL. PAUL.

255
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,595
UM, I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW

256
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,598
THAT, YOU KNOW, ROSS REALLY IS A GREAT GUY.

257
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,099
WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD DATE HIM, THEN.

258
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,101
THAT WOULD SAVE ME THE TROUBLE OF KILLING HIM.

259
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,608
ARE YOU OKAY?

260
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,611
YOU JUST DON'T LOOK OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE A 20 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER.

261
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,613
WELL, WE WERE VERY YOUNG WHEN WE HAD HER.

262
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,615
OH, WE?

263
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,616
WELL, YEAH.

264
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,117
IT USUALLY TAKES TWO PEOPLE TO...

265
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,619
OH, NO! YES!

266
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,621
OF COURSE... I KNOW THAT.

267
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:26,125
I MEANT, ARE YOU STILL WE, OR ARE YOU JUST YOU?

268
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,127
I'M JUST ME, YEAH.

269
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,630
MY WIFE DIED SHORTLY AFTER LIZZY WAS BORN.

270
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,131
OH!

271
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,634
SO YOU RAISED HER ALL ON YOUR OWN?

272
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,636
YES, I DID.

273
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,638
OH! OH...

274
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,142
WHAT ARE YOU WRITING THERE?

275
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,144
I'M DRAWING A PICTURE OF YOU.

276
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,646
MMM. WELL, THAT'S VERY FLATTERING.

277
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,147
YEAH, BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT

278
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,649
IF YOU COULD DRAW ME WITH SOME CLOTHES

279
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,150
AND, YOU KNOW, A HEAD.

280
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,654
 HEY.

281
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,656
HOW WAS YOUR FIRST DAY? PRETTY GREAT.

282
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,658
EXCEPT I DID GET A LITTLE ATTITUDE FROM THE ROBOT.

283
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,159
DAMN THOSE ROBOTS.

284
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,162
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE OUR FAITHFUL SERVANTS!

285
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,163
ANYWAY, IT WASN'T THE ROBOT,

286
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,165
IT WAS THE GUY WHO CONTROLS HIM.

287
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,667
YEAH, HE DOESN'T LIKE ME.

288
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,669
HE HAD C.H.E.E.S.E. KNOCK OVER THE SANDWICH TABLE

289
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,671
RIGHT WHEN I WAS REACHING FOR ONE-- OH!

290
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,173
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST GET HIM FIRED?

291
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,675
I MAY HAVE TO.

292
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,177
I HATE TO DO IT, BUT I'M THE STAR, YOU KNOW?

293
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,179
THERE'S A LIMIT TO HOW MANY SANDWICHES

294
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,681
I CAN EAT OFF THE FLOOR.

295
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,182

296
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,684
EXCUSE ME.

297
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,187
JOEY TRIBBIANI.

298
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,189
JOE! I'M GLAD I FOUND YOU!

299
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,691
I GOT AN AUDITION FOR YOU!

300
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,192
Wow!

301
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,194
The thing is, it's kind of on the Q.T.

302
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,196
THE ACTOR WHO HAS THE PART

303
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,699
DOESN'T KNOW HE MIGHT BE FIRED.

304
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,701
It's the lead in a series--

305
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,703
MAC AND C.H.E.E.S.E.

306
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,206
I'M THE LEAD IN MAC AND C.H.E.E.S.E.!

307
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,709
UH OH!

308
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,212
JOEY?

309
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,717
HI, ROSS.

310
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,723
I WAS JUST GETTING HIM TO LIKE YOU.

311
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,227
JOEY!

312
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:09,729
JOEY?!

313
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,230
HEY, ROSS.

314
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,733
ROSS, JOEY IS NOT HERE.

315
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,235
OKAY, I'LL JUST WAIT FOR HIM IN HERE.

316
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,236
ROSS, IT'S OKAY.

317
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,237
YOU CAN COME OUT.

318
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,740
YEAH, ROSS, IT'S OKAY.

319
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,242
IT'S ME-- MR. STEVENS.

320
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,744
PAUL, I DIDN'T...

321
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,747
OH, MY GOSH, I DIDN'T EVEN SEE YOU.

322
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,248
SURE, YOU DID.

323
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,750
YOU CAME IN, YOU GOT ALL AWKWARD.

324
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,251
YOU RAN TO THE BEDROOM.

325
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,753
YOU WERE SHOUTING, "JOEY! JOEY!"

326
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,256
BYE, RACHEL. BYE.

327
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,758
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

328
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,259
OKAY. SEE YOU.

329
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,261
BYE, ROSS.

330
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,263
WHAT...

331
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,266
WHAT... HOW... WHAT THE... HOW... WHAT?

332
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,269
WELL, YOU KNOW, HE LOST HIS KEYS

333
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,772
SO HE WAS LOOKING FOR THEM.

334
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,273
IN YOUR MOUTH?

335
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,276
NO...

336
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,278
DOWNSTAIRS.

337
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,781
AND WE GOT TO TALKING, YOU KNOW, FOR, LIKE, TWO HOURS

338
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,782
AND I REALLY LIKED HIM.

339
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,784
SO I INVITED HIM UP HERE FOR A CUP OF COFFEE.

340
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,787
YOU WERE AT THE COFFEEHOUSE.

341
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,289
ROSS, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

342
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,791
SO I KISSED THE GUY.

343
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,794
HE'S MY GIRLFRIEND'S FATHER, OKAY?

344
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,295
IT'S... IT'S WEIRD.

345
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,797
YOU DATED MY SISTER.

346
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,799
THAT WAS DIFFERENT.

347
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,800
WHAT? WHY?

348
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,304
THIS IS WEIRD FORME.

349
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,305
ROSS, LOOK, LOOK...

350
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,807
THIS IS GOOD FOR YOU, OKAY?

351
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,808
LET'S FACE IT.

352
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,310
SO FAR, THE GUY'S NOT LOVING YOU

353
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,812
BUT I CAN TURN THAT AROUND.

354
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,814
I GOT THE INSIDE TRACK.

355
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,816
WE CAN ALL GO OUT TO DINNER.

356
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,318
YOU KNOW, AND I CAN TALK YOU UP.

357
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:43,322
PLUS, THE GUY IS A VERY, VERY SUCCESSFUL LAWYER.

358
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,824
HOW IS THAT IMPORTANT?

359
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,325
OH, IT'S IMPORTANT.

360
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,330
SO, APPARENTLY, THERE'S, LIKE, A MILLION GUYS OUT THERE

361
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,331
THAT CAN PLAY MAC.

362
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,833
AND THERE'S ONLY THIS ONE ROBOT

363
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,835
AND THIS ONE GUY WHO CONTROLS IT.

364
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,336
I DIDN'T KNOW HE COULD GET ME FIRED.

365
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,838
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

366
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,839
WELL, YOU KNOW, JOEY

367
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,341
YOU'RE A PRETTY CHARMING GUY.

368
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,343
THANKS, BUT I KIND OF HAVE A PROBLEM TO DEAL WITH HERE.

369
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,846
NO, SWEETIE, YOU'VE GOT TO WIN OVER THE GUY

370
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,848
WHO CONTROLS C.H.E.E.S.E.

371
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:09,849
YOU GOT TO GO BACK THERE

372
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,851
AND KISS SOME SERIOUS ROBOT ASS.

373
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,855
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

374
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,857
OKAY, BUT IF I GOT TO TURN ON THE CHARM TOMORROW

375
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,359
I'M NOT WASTING ANY MORE OF IT OVER HERE WITH YOU GUYS.

376
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,362
WELL, ACTUALLY, I GOT A LITTLE BIT SAVED FOR YOU, PHEEBS.

377
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,368
SO YOU DO YOU THINK, UH, JOEY'S MORE CHARMING THAN ME?

378
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,871
YEAH. THAT'S WHY I'M SLEEPING WITH HIM ON THE SIDE.

379
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,873
YEAH, YOU WISH.

380
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,378
"YOU WISH."

381
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,880
PHOEBE, STOP WRITING ABOUT US.

382
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,882
I'M NOT WRITING ABOUT YOU.

383
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,884
I'M WRITING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE.

384
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,385
WHO?

385
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,387
MARSHA AND CHESTER.

386
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,389
OKAY, FINE, FINE.

387
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,891
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT?

388
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,893
I WILL JUST WRITE ABOUT PHYLLIS.

389
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,395
"PHYLLIS IS SITTING IN A CHAIR."

390
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,396
OOH.

391
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,397
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

392
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,899
"PHYLLIS SEES WHAT I'M DOING."

393
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,901
OOH HOO.

394
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:06,906
OOH, I HAVE TASTED MY OWN MEDICINE, AND IT IS BITTER.

395
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,913
MORNING. HEY...

396
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,414
HOW'S MY FAVORITE GENIUS

397
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,916
AND HIS LITTLE ROBOT BUDDY?

398
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,917
DON'T TOUCH HIM.

399
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,918
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

400
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,920
UH, ALL RIGHT, WAYNE... LOOK

401
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,421
LEVEL WITH ME, OKAY?

402
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,423
I KEEP HEARING ALL THESE RUMORS

403
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,925
THAT I MIGHT GET FIRED.

404
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,927
OKAY, THEY EVEN HAVE ACTORS COMING IN

405
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,428
TO READ FOR MY PART.

406
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,429
COME ON, MAN.

407
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,931
YOU GOT TO GIVE  ME A SECOND CHANCE.

408
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,934
I MEAN, I LOVE THIS LITTLE GUY...

409
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,435
OKAY.

410
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,938
THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T WANT ME  TO TOUCH HIM, RIGHT?

411
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,439
HERE YOU GO.

412
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,941
STUPID...

413
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,442
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

414
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,443
GOD...

415
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,447
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

416
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,955
SO, IT SEEMED THAT MY PROM DATE

417
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,458
HAD STOOD ME UP, SO ROSS SELFLESSLY

418
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,961
OFFERED TO TAKE ME.

419
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,463
WHAT A NICE STORY.

420
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,464
SO ROSS WAS IN COLLEGE

421
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,966
AND DECIDED TO JUMP AT THE CHANCE

422
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,468
TO TAKE A YOUNG GIRL TO HER HIGH SCHOOL PROM.

423
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,972
WOW...

424
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,975
I DEFINITELY DID NOT SEE THAT ONE BACKFIRING.

425
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,977
I'M GOING TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

426
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,979
YEAH, TAKE YOUR TIME.

427
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,482
YOU KNOW, JUST SO YOU KNOW

428
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,984
I WAS A FRESHMAN AND SHE WAS A SENIOR.

429
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,485
SO IT WASN'T AS BAD AS...

430
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,489
ROSS, LOOK, I KNOW I HAVE BEEN GIVING YOU A LOT OF JABS

431
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,493
AND IT'S PARTLY BECAUSE I'M VERY PROTECTIVE OF LIZZY

432
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,497
AND PARTLY BECAUSE, WELL, THEY JUST KEEP COMING TO ME.

433
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,001
BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT AFTER

434
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:46,005
ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS LIZZY HAS TOLD ME

435
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,508
AND THE MANY, MANY, MANY STORIES

436
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,510
THAT RACHEL HAS TOLD ME

437
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,013
THAT, WELL...

438
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,516
YOU'RE NOT... ALL BAD.

439
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:03,022
"NOT ALL BAD."

440
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,524
AND YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY I WAS SO HARSH BEFORE

441
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,026
BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

442
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,527
I STILL LOOK AT LIZZY

443
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,029
LIKE SHE'S A 12 YEAR OLD GIRL.

444
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,530
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

445
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,032
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

446
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,033
I DO THAT, TOO.

447
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,535
I BEG YOUR PARDON.

448
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,037
NO, NO, I'M NOT...

449
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,539
I DON'T MEAN I SEE HER AS A 12 YEAR OLD GIRL.

450
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,541
I MEAN, I HAVE A SON WHO'S SIX

451
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,044
AND I STILL THINK OF HIM AS A BABY.

452
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,045
YOU HAVE A SON?

453
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,546
WELL, MY EX WIFE AND I

454
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,048
SHARE CUSTODY OF BEN

455
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,050
AND, UH, JUST SO YOU KNOW

456
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,052
CAROL AND I ARE ON EXCELLENT TERMS

457
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,055
AS I'M SURE YOU ARE WITH YOUR WIFE.

458
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:36,555
OH, I'M SORRY.

459
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:40,059
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE!

460
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,560
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

461
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,562
I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE MARRIED.

462
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:48,567
OH, WE WERE, BUT THAT WAS JUST A...

463
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:53,572
I MEAN, THAT WAS JUST A BIG DRUNKEN MISTAKE.

464
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,576
YOU'RE BACK.

465
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,578
YOU TWO WERE MARRIED?

466
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,580
OH, WHOOPS, I'M SORRY.

467
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,583
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT EMILY.

468
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,588
CHANDLER, WE SAID WE WOULD MEET

469
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,590
AT THE COFFEEHOUSE AT 6:00.

470
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,092
WE SAID 7:00.

471
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,093
WE SAID 6:00.

472
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,595
THE ONLY WAY THAT I SAID 6:00

473
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,098
WOULD BE IF I SAID THE SENTENCE:

474
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,600
"LET'S MEET AT 7:00, NOT AT 6:00."

475
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,102
YEAH, AND IF I HAD SAID 7:00

476
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,104
MAYBE I WOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

477
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,606
"WOW, MY BOYFRIEND IS SUCH A WISE ASS, 7:00."

478
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,109
HI.

479
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,111
OH, MY GOOD GOD.

480
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,113
I KNOW WHAT TIME YOU SAID.

481
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:34,613
WHAT?

482
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,116
WELL, ACTUALLY, I KNOW WHAT TIME

483
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,617
CHESTER AND MARSHA SAID.

484
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,619
WHAT TIME?

485
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,621
QUITE AN INTERESTING TURN OF EVENTS.

486
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,124
SUDDENLY, IT'S MY BOOK TO THE RESCUE, HUH?

487
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,125
LET'S SEE.

488
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,127
OOH, VERY INTERESTING.

489
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:52,131
YEAH, WELL, THIS CERTAINLY CLEARS THINGS UP.

490
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,133
WHAT DOES IT SAY?

491
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,134
I WILL TELL YOU

492
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,136
AS SOON AS YOU THANK ME FOR WRITING MY BOOK.

493
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,639
THANK YOU FOR WRITING YOUR BOOK.

494
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,641
IT'S A GREAT BOOK

495
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,145
AND YOU ARE THE QUEEN OF EVERYTHING.

496
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,648
THANKS. SO ARE YOU.

497
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:19,658
TOLD YOU I SHOULD NOT WEAR THIS COLOR.

498
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,162
"MONICA... MARSHA AND CHESTER

499
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,665
"ARE PLANNING ON SEEING A MOVIE SUNDAY NIGHT.

500
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,668
"MARSHA THINKS THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO MEET AT 6:00.

501
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,670
CHESTER THINKS IT'S AT 7:00."

502
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,173
SO YOU KNEW WE WERE GOING TO MISS THE MOVIE?

503
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,174
THAT'S RIGHT.

504
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,675
INSTEAD OF TELLING US

505
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,177
YOU DECIDED TO WRITE IT IN YOUR STUPID BOOK?

506
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:42,681
"MARSHA AND CHESTER ARE MAD AT PHYLLIS."

507
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,689
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GOING TO LOSE THIS JOB.

508
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,690
OH, I'M SO SORRY, MAN.

509
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,192
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?

510
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,194
YEAH. HELP ME GET THIS MINI FRIDGE

511
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,196
PAST THE SECURITY GUARD.

512
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,698

513
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,204
HEY, JOEY, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

514
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,706
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU, WAYNE.

515
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,707
I HATE YOU.

516
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,708
YOU RUINED MY LIFE.

517
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,210
OH. CHANDLER, WAYNE. WAYNE, CHANDLER.

518
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,711
HI, HOW ARE YOU?

519
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:17,216
JOEY, JOEY, I'LL GET YOU YOUR JOB BACK IF YOU HELP ME OUT.

520
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,218
WHY SHOULD I HELP YOU OUT?

521
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,719
THE REASON HE JUST SAID.

522
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,222
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

523
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,224
I SAW YOU ON STAGE

524
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,227
TALKING TO THAT BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

525
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,728
YOU KNOW, SARAH.

526
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,230
I WISH I COULD TALK TO HER.

527
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,232
WHAT? ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH HER OR SOMETHING?

528
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:37,236
YEAH... HER... ALL OF THEM... ANYONE.

529
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,739
YEAH, I BEEN THERE, MY FRIEND.

530
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,741
LISTEN, I GUARANTEE YOU KEEP YOUR JOB

531
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,744
IF YOU CAN TEACH ME HOW TO TALK TO WOMEN LIKE YOU DO.

532
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,246
OH, WELL, WAYNE...

533
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,248
IT'S NOT REALLY SOMETHING YOU CAN TEACH, YOU KNOW?

534
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,750
IT'S PRETTY MUCH SOMETHING YOU'RE BORN WITH...

535
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,751
YOU CAN TEACH IT.

536
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,253
I CAN SHOW YOU HOW TO DO IT.

537
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,255
REA... REA... REALLY?

538
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,756
SURE. YEAH. TAUGHT HIM.

539
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,758
YEAH. YOU SHOULD SEE THE WOMAN I'M WITH--

540
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,260
WAY OUT OF MY LEAGUE.

541
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,762
IN FACT, IF YOU WANT, I CAN GET YOU HER.

542
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,268
I MEAN, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT

543
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,769
I MEAN, ROSS DID LEARN SOMETHING

544
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,271
FROM EACH MARRIAGE.

545
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,273
HOW TO MAKE THE NEXT ONE EVEN SHORTER?

546
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,274
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

547
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,275
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

548
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,776
I MEAN, HE WAS MARRIED TO ME

549
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,779
A HELL OF A LOT LONGER THAN HE WAS MARRIED TO EMILY.

550
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,281
HE JUST DIDN'T TELL ME.

551
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,287
MAYBE I HAVE TO PEE AGAIN.

552
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,794
WELL, THIS IS FUN.

553
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,798
SO, ROSS, DID YOU KILL ANY OF THESE WIVES?

554
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,300
YOU KNOW WHAT?

555
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,801
I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS.

556
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,804
YOU KNOW, I CARE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER

557
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,307
AND I HAVE TREATED HER WITH NOTHING BUT RESPECT.

558
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,310
SO, IF YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH ME, FRANKLY, I...

559
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,811
ARE YOU YELLING AT ME?

560
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,813
GOD, NO.

561
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,815
YOU KNOW WHAT, DADDY?

562
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,318
IF YOU DON'T LIKE ROSS, THAT'S FINE.

563
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,819
IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.

564
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,322
I'M GOING TO GO OUT WITH HIM ANYWAY.

565
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,323
REALLY?

566
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,326
WELL, IF IT DOESN'T MATTER TO HER

567
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,328
IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.

568
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,829
STILL NOT YELLING.

569
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,833
WELL...

570
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,336
WHAT CAN I SAY?

571
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,840
THIS DOESN'T MAKE ME LIKE YOU ANY BETTER.

572
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,342
THAT'S OKAY.

573
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,344
I'M NOT SO CRAZY ABOUT MYSELF RIGHT NOW EITHER.

574
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,345
THEN WE AGREE?

575
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,846
YEAH, YEAH, I GUESS SO.

576
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:28,847
NEITHER OF US LIKE ROSS.

577
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,849
I LIKE ROSS.

578
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,851
OH... KIDS.

579
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,354
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

580
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,855
I JUST THOUGHT OF ANOTHER STORY

581
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,357
ABOUT HOW NICE ROSS IS.

582
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,358
UH, IT'S OKAY, RACHE.

583
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,859
WE'RE NOT LIKING ROSS RIGHT NOW.

584
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,361
OH, I GOT A LOT OF THOSE, TOO.

585
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,868
WELL, TURNS OUT YOU WERE RIGHT, C.H.E.E.S.E.

586
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,371
THE SHIPMENT NEVER MADE IT THROUGH OMAHA?

587
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,372
YOU GOT IT.

588
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,873
AND THE RABBI'S BEARD--

589
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,875
100% HORSE HAIR.

590
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,378
NICE CATCH, C.H.E.E.S.E.

591
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,884
IT'S YOUR LINE, C.H.E.E.S.E.

592
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:09,888
WAYNE!

593
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,390
WAYNE!
