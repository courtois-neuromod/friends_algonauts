1
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:08,508
WELL, THAT THING'S CLEARLY IN THE WAY.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,511
ALL RIGHT. AHA!

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,014

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,515
DAMN FRIDGE!

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,518
HEY, JOEY, HOW YOU DOING?

6
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,020
GREAT...

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,521
ROOMIE.

8
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,524
HUH. YEAH, I GUESS WE ARE ROOMMATES NOW.

9
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,526
NOW THAT YOU BRING IT UP

10
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,028
UH, OUR FRIDGE IS BROKEN.

11
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,030
WE HAVE TO GET A NEW ONE.

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,532
I CHECKED AROUND, AND YOUR HALF IS $400 DOLLARS.

13
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,533
THANKS A LOT, RACH.

14
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,036
I'M NOT PAYING FOR HALF OF THAT.

15
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:40,040
I'M ONLY STAYING HERE UNTIL MY APARTMENT GETS FIXED.

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,542
LOOK, RACH, MY PARENTS BOUGHT THIS FRIDGE

17
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,544
JUST AFTER I WAS BORN, OKAY?

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,047
NOW, I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT.

19
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,549
THEN YOU SHOW UP AND IT BREAKS.

20
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,552
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

21
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:57,557
THAT REFRIGERATORS DON'T LIVE AS LONG AS PEOPLE.

22
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,061
ALL RIGHT, NOW, YOU KNOW THAT THE A.T.M.

23
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,063
WILL ONLY LET YOU TAKE OUT $300 AT A TIME

24
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,065
SO I'LL TAKE A CHECK FOR THE OTHER $100 DOLLARS.

25
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,567
YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

26
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,570
OF COURSE I'M JOKING.

27
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,073
I DON'T TAKE CHECKS.

28
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,076
THANK GOD YOU'RE PRETTY.

38
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,118
HEY.

39
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,119
HI. HEY.

40
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,621
DO YOU GUYS KNOW ANY CUTE GUYS?

41
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,622
WELL, OF COURSE I DO.

42
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,624
MY GOOD FRIEND JOEY OVER HERE.

43
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,130
OH, I'M SORRY.

44
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,132
THANK YOU, CHANDLER.

45
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,633
ANYWAY...

46
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,635
THERE'S THIS BIG CHARITY BALL THIS WEEKEND

47
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,138
AND RALPH LAUREN BOUGHT A TABLE, SO I KIND OF HAVE TO GO.

48
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,139
WHAT'S THE CHARITY?

49
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,640
I DON'T KNOW.

50
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:25,145
SOMETHING, EITHER TREES, OR... DISEASE...

51
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,647
RALPH MUMBLES A LOT.

52
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,149
DOES RALPH MUMBLE WHEN YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION?

53
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,151
YEAH, IT'S WEIRD.

54
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,654
BUT THE THING IS, I NEED TO FIND A DATE.

55
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,656
WHAT KIND OF GUY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

56
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,658
WELL, SOMEONE THAT HAS HIS OWN TUX

57
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,660
OR THE ABILITY TO RENT A TUX.

58
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,663
SO HE HAS TO BE A MALE WHO HAS AT LEAST $50 DOLLARS.

59
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:47,167
OOH, SO CLOSE.

60
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,168
HEY, EVERYBODY.

61
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,169
HI. HI, THERE.

62
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,171
THIS IS ELIZABETH.

63
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,172
 HI.

64
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,174
I'M THE STUDENT.

65
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,676
OH, ISN'T SHE CUTE?

66
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,178
NO.

67
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,181
YOU KNOW, THIS IS PROBABLY NONE OF MY BUSINESS

68
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,184
BUT WEREN'T YOU GUYS SUPPOSED TO NOT BE SEEN IN PUBLIC TOGETHER?

69
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,685
OH, WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

70
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,187
NO, WE'RE JUST TWO PEOPLE

71
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,189
WHO HAPPENED TO HAVE RUN INTO EACH OTHER

72
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,190
HERE AT THE COFFEE HOUSE.

73
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,692

74
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,694
OH, SLY.

75
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,698
I REALLY WANTED TO MEET YOU GUYS, BUT I HAVE TO RUN.

76
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,699
I'LL SEE YOU LATER?

77
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,700
 OKAY.

78
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,701
BYE, ROSS. BYE.

79
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,204
OOPS. DIDN'T MEAN TO RUN INTO YOU LIKE THAT, SIR.

80
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,206
OH, THAT IS QUITE ALL RIGHT, MA'AM.

81
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,708
BYE.

82
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,709
SO, WHY IS SHE LEAVING?

83
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,211
IS IT A SCHOOL NIGHT

84
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,712
AND SHE HAS A LOT OF HOMEWORK TO DO?

85
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:36,216
YES, HER MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY PAPER IS DUE TOMORROW.

86
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:40,720
OH, TELL HER GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

87
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,222
ANYONE ELSE? HUH?

88
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,223
BRING THEM ON.

89
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,225
OH! WHEN'S HER BIRTHDAY?

90
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,227
I DON'T KNOW, RACHEL. WHY?

91
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,229
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST BEEN SO LONG

92
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,730
SINCE I'VE BEEN TO CHUCK E. CHEESE.

93
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,732

94
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,733
OH, I LIKE ELIZABETH.

95
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,734
WELL, THANKS.

96
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,236
YEAH, IN FACT, I LIKE HER SO MUCH

97
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,238
THAT YOU TELL HER I WANT MY COOKIES

98
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,239
EARLY THIS YEAR.

99
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,740
YOU KNOW...

100
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,742
A BOX OF THIN MINTS AND SOME TAGALONGS.

101
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,745
HEY, COME ON, GIVE HIM A BREAK.

102
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,747
ROSS, SERIOUSLY, HOW'S IT GOING WITH HER?

103
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,249
WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN GREAT.

104
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,752
SHE'S 20, SO SHE'S NOT LOOKING FOR ANYTHING TOO SERIOUS

105
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,754
WHICH IS PERFECT FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

106
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,755
WELL, THAT IS GREAT.

107
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,757
AND SERIOUSLY, SHE SEEMS VERY NICE.

108
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,260
THANKS. I KNOW YOU GUYS LIKE TO GIVE ME A HARD TIME AND ALL

109
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,262
BUT IT REALLY MEANS A LOT TO ME THAT YOU LIKE HER.

110
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,264
JUST KNOWING THAT YOU GUYS ARE LIKE...

111
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,766
OKAY, I GOT A GOOD ONE.

112
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,767
OKAY, UM...

113
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,770
WHAT IS SHE, LIKE, 12?

114
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,781
CHANDLER, DO YOU THINK

115
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,283
WE TALK ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP ENOUGH?

116
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,285
YEAH. DO WE HAVE ANY FRUIT ROLL UPS?

117
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,288
HEY.

118
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,289
HEY. HEY.

119
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,791
OKAY, I JUST THOUGHT OF THE PERFECT GUY FOR RACHEL

120
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,792
TO TAKE TO HER THING.

121
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,794
OH, THAT'S SO FUNNY, BECAUSE WE FOUND SOMEONE, TOO.

122
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:55,795
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

123
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,297
I GUESS SHE'LL HAVE A CHOICE

124
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,299
BETWEEN MY GUY AND YOUR WEIRDO.

125
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,301
WHY WOULD OUR GUY BE A WEIRDO?

126
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,303
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST YOUR TASTE.

127
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,804

128
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,308
SEE, RACHEL'S NOT GOING TO PICK YOUR STUPID GUY.

129
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,309
OH, YEAH?

130
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,310
YEAH.

131
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,813
MY GUY IS A LAWYER WHO DOES VOLUNTEER WORK

132
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,815
AND HE HAS ONE OF THESE.

133
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,817
A FACE ASS?

134
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,320
A CHIN DIMPLE.

135
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,822
WELL, UH, YOU KNOW, OUR GUY WORKS WITH CHANDLER

136
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,824
AND HE'S REALLY NICE AND SMART

137
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,825
AND HE'S A GREAT DRESSER.

138
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,827
HAVE YOU SEEN YOUR GUY'S BODY?

139
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,830
NO. OUR GUY'S JUST A FLOATING HEAD.

140
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,333
WELL, MY GUY IS SPECTACULAR, OKAY?

141
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,834
HE'S A MASSAGE CLIENT.

142
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,837
AND ONE TIME, WHEN HE WAS ON THE TABLE

143
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,840
I LOOKED AT IT, AND I MEAN ALL OF IT.

144
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,842
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO LOOK.

145
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,844
OH, YEAH, LIKE THERE ARE POLICE FOR THAT.

146
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,348
YOU LOOK? YOU YOU MASSAGE ME.

147
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,349
I KNOW.

148
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,850
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

149
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,853
YOUR GUY MAY HAVE A GREAT BODY

150
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,356
BUT OUR GUY IS REALLY FUNNY.

151
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,357
CHANDLER FUNNY?

152
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,360
OUR GUY'S A GREAT DANCER.

153
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,361
MY GUY'S WELL READ.

154
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,862
OUR GUY HAS GREAT HAIR.

155
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,863
MY GUY HAS GREAT TEETH.

156
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,366
OUR GUY SMELLS INCREDIBLE.

157
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,869
DO YOU WANT OUR GUY TO BE YOUR GUY?

158
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,373
HEY.

159
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,375
UH...

160
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,879
WELL, YOU...

161
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,382
YOU DON'T LOOK GOOD, JOE.

162
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,883
WELL, THE FRIDGE BROKE

163
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,885
SO I HAD TO EAT EVERYTHING.

164
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,889
COLD CUTS, ICE CREAM, LIMES...

165
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,892
HEY, WHAT WAS IN THAT BROWN JAR?

166
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,394
THAT'S STILL IN THERE?

167
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,395
NOT ANYMORE.

168
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,899
SO, ANYWAY, HOW DO YOU WANT TO PAY ME?

169
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,903
IS THIS A SERVICE YOU'RE PROVIDING ME?

170
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,407
NO, NO, NO... FOR MY NEW FRIDGE--

171
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,409
OUR NEW FRIDGE.

172
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,410
OUR NEW FRIDGE?

173
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,912
I DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

174
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,913
SO WHAT?

175
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,915
LOOK, OKAY, SUPPOSE WE WERE A DIVORCED COUPLE.

176
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,417
UH HUH.

177
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,919
AND I GOT CUSTODY OF THE KID, RIGHT?

178
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,924
NOW, SUPPOSE THE KID DIES AND I GOT TO BUY A NEW KID.

179
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,928
OKAY.

180
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,432
GIVE ME $400 DOLLARS.

181
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,435
THANK GOD YOU'RE PRETTY.

182
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,445
PROFESSOR GELLER?

183
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,948
MM? OH, A STUDENT I DON'T KNOW.

184
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,452
I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD TALK TO YOU FOR A MOMENT?

185
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,453
YES, OF COURSE.

186
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,455
WHAT WOULD THIS BE REGARDING?

187
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,457
MAKING OUT IN YOUR OFFICE.

188
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,458
WH... SHH!

189
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,959
OF OF COURSE.

190
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,462
WHY DON'T WE GO INSIDE?

191
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,465

192
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:49,969
MM MM...

193
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:50,970
OH, OH...

194
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,472
WHAT? DOORKNOB.

195
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,973
DOORKNOB.

196
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,975
SORRY.

197
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,977
UM, I ACTUALLY DO NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

198
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,479
OH, OKAY. WHAT ABOUT?

199
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,480
SPRING VACATION.

200
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,481
SPRING VACATION.

201
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,982
YEAH. WE HAVE TIME OFF

202
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,485
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING ON TRIPS, AND...

203
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,986
PROFESSOR GELLER?

204
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,989
YES, PROFESSOR FRIE SEN... STIN LINDER.

205
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,991
I'LL BE WITH YOU IN ONE MOMENT.

206
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,997
SO, I WILL TAKE ONE BOX OF THE THIN MINTS.

207
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,502
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

208
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,506
ELIZABETH WAS ABOUT TO ASK ME TO GO ON A TRIP WITH HER.

209
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,007
IS THAT TAKING IT SLOW?

210
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,509
I'M NOT READY FOR THIS, OKAY?

211
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,510
WHAT DO I TELL HER?

212
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,511
JUST TELL HER THE TRUTH.

213
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,012
TELL HER YOU'RE NOT READY.

214
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,014
I COULD DO THAT.

215
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,518
WHAT IF SHE GETS UPSET?

216
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,520
THEN YOU DISTRACT HER WITH A BARBIE DOLL.

217
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,524
OR...

218
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,025
YOU COULD JUST, YOU KNOW...

219
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,533
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

220
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,535
WHA...

221
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,537
WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING?

222
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,038
YOU JUST BROKE MY FRIDGE!

223
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,541
WHAT? HOW DO YOU KNOW IF...

224
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,544
HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S EVEN BROKEN?

225
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,547
OH, YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW WHAT BREAKS MY FRIDGE?

226
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,049
EXCUSE ME.

227
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,052
WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

228
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,555
BROKEN.

229
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,057
THAT'LL BE $400 DOLLARS.

230
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:21,060
JOEY, I SAW YOU PUSH HIM.

231
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,063
YOU PUSHED HIM.

232
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,068
JOEY, I DID NOT BREAK THIS, OKAY?

233
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,572
THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN FOR A WHILE.

234
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,076
CHANDLER, REMEMBER I TOLD YOU ABOUT OUR FRIDGE?

235
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,077
UH HUH.

236
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,078
I STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN

237
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,080
A CHECK FOR YOUR HALF YET.

238
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,582
DO NOT GIVE HIM ANY MONEY.

239
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,083
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU!

240
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,585
YOU BROKE MY FRIDGE!

241
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,096
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME, PROFESSOR GELLER?

242
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,598
YES. YES, PLEASE COME IN.

243
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,603
OOH OOH...

244
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,604
DOORKNOB?

245
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,106
YEAH. IT KIND OF GROWS ON YOU.

246
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,107

247
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,109
ACTUALLY, I WANTED TO FINISH TALKING TO YOU

248
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,611
ABOUT SPRING VACATION.

249
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,112
OH, GOOD.

250
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,616
LOOK, I...

251
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,624
LOOK, I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME WITH YOU

252
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,627
AND I JUST DON'T WANT US TO MOVE TOO FAST

253
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,129
OR PUT TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON US.

254
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,130
SO, I'M SORRY.

255
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,633
I JUST DON'T THINK WE SHOULD GO AWAY TOGETHER YET.

256
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,134
IT'S TOO SOON.

257
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,136
UM, ROSS, I THINK YOU MISUNDERSTOOD

258
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,137
WHAT I WAS SAYING.

259
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,139
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU

260
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,142
THAT I'M GOING TO FLORIDA FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

261
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:52,652
NO. I THINK YOU MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT I WAS SAYING.

262
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,154
WHAT I MEANT WAS...

263
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,656
YOU ARE SO ADORABLE.

264
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,659
THAT... LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.

265
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,160

266
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,663
HI. HEY.

267
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,665
HOW DID IT GO WITH ELIZABETH?

268
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,166
OH, OH, IT WAS FINE.

269
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,168
UH, IT WAS JUST A MISUNDERSTANDING.

270
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,170
SHE DIDN'T WANT ME TO GO WITH HER.

271
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,672
SHE JUST WANTED TO LET ME KNOW

272
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,675
THAT SHE'S GOING TO FLORIDA FOR SPRING VACATION.

273
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,676
WAIT A MINUTE.

274
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,677
IS SHE GOING FOR SPRING VACATION

275
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,679
OR IS SHE GOING FOR SPRING BREAK? WHOO HOO!

276
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,682
WHAT'S WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

277
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,183
WELL, A SPRING VACATION

278
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,686
YOU'RE DOING NICE THINGS WITH YOUR GRANDPARENTS.

279
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,188
SPRING BREAK, YOU'RE DOING FRAT GUYS.

280
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,190
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

281
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,693
NOT ALL SPRING BREAKS ARE LIKE THAT.

282
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,694
WHAT'D YOU DO ON YOURS?

283
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,696
I WENT TO EGYPT WITH MY DAD.

284
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,199
I CAN SEE IT NOW.

285
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,702
LOOK, DAD, IT'S THE SPHINX.

286
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,203
WHOO WHOO!

287
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,205
I THINK ELIZABETH IS A LITTLE MORE SERIOUS

288
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,207
THAN SPRING BREAK... WHOO HOO!

289
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,209
ALL RIGHT, I MEAN, COME ON.

290
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,711
SHE'S TAKING MY CLASS.

291
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,212
AND SLEPT WITH THE PROFESSOR.

292
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,213
I'M GOING TO CALL HER.

293
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,715
YEAH.

294
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,218
HEY.

295
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,220
YOU GUYS, UM, I WANT YOU TO MEET SEBASTIAN.

296
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,722
HI.

297
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,724

298
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,226
WE BOTH GRABBED FOR THE LAST FIELD AND STREAM.

299
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,230
WHAT? I READ THAT.

300
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,733
CAN I GET YOU A CUP OF COFFEE?

301
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,234
OH, YES, THANK YOU.

302
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,739
RACHEL, WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

303
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,240
WHAT?

304
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,742
YOU ASKED US TO FIND YOU A GUY

305
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,244
AND THEN YOU COME TRAIPSING IN HERE WITH A GUY OF YOUR OWN?

306
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,746
YOU FOUND ME A GUY?

307
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,247

YEAH, AND I FOUND YOU ONE, TOO

310
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,253
WHO IS NOT A WEIRDO.

311
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,755
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH, YOU GUYS?

312
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,757
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT

313
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,260
BUT I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE SEBASTIAN TO THE CHARITY.

314
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,261
ARE YOU SURE?

315
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,263
BECAUSE OUR GUY SMELLS INCREDIBLE.

316
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,266
WOULD YOU STOP IT WITH THAT ALREADY?

317
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,267
HERE YOU GO.

318
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,269
OH, THANK YOU.

319
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,270

320
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,271
SO, SEBASTIAN

321
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,273
DO YOU DO ANY VOLUNTEER WORK?

322
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,775
UH, NO. NOT REALLY. WHY?

323
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,277
NO REASON; IT'S JUST I KNOW A SINGLE GUY

324
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,279
WHO DOES CARE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE.

325
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,281

326
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:04,784
EXCUSE ME?

327
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,786

328
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,787
ARE YOU FUNNY?

329
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,288

330
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,792
LOOK, I JUST WANTED TO HAVE COFFEE WITH RACHEL.

331
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,794
WELL, SO DO A LOT OF PEOPLE.

332
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,797
ACTUALLY, UH, I GOT TO GET GOING.

333
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,798
OH...

00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,800
GIVE ME A CALL SOMETIME.

335
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,802
YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME YOUR PHONE NUMBER.

336
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,303
OKAY, SEE YOU LATER.

337
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,807
TURNS OUT HE IS KIND OF FUNNY.

338
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,812
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU GUYS.

339
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,313
HE WAS REALLY NICE

340
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,815
AND HE JUST LEFT BECAUSE OF YOU.

341
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,316
YEAH, BUT SEBASTIAN?

342
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,818
WHAT IS THAT, A CAT'S NAME?

343
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,820
 YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT

344
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,821
I NOTICED, RACHEL?

345
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,322
HE SCARES EASY, YOU KNOW.

346
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,325
IS THAT THE KIND OF GUY YOU WANT TO TAKE TO A BALL?

347
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,828
"HEY, SEBASTIAN, WOULD YOU LIKE TO DANCE?"

348
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,830
"UH... OKAY, I GOT TO GO."

349
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,332
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, STOP IT.

350
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,333
RACHEL, WE'RE VERY SORRY.

351
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,836
THAT WAS A VERY INSENSITIVE THING FOR US TO DO.

352
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,838
AND, YOU KNOW WHAT, LET US MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

353
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,840
WE HAVE TWO REALLY GREAT GUYS FOR YOU.

354
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,842
 YEAH, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE?

355
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,344
YOU MIGHT EVEN END UP WITH SOMEONE REALLY SPECIAL

356
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,846
IF YOU PICK MY GUY.

357
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,849
ALL RIGHT.

358
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,350
OKAY, SO YOU WILL MEET OUR GUYS?

359
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,852
YES, I'LL MEET THEM.

360
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,854
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH ONE YOU CHOOSE.

361
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,355
IT'S COMPLETELY UP TO YOU.

362
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,356
OUR GUY IS PERFECT...

363
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,858
OR YOU COULD GO OUT WITH THE GUY

364
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,861
PHOEBE DEEMED NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO GO OUT WITH HERSELF.

365
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,864
PHOEBE, THERE YOU ARE.

366
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,365
OKAY, YOU BROKE MY FRIDGE.

00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,867

OOH! TECHNICALLY, YOU OWE ME $600 DOLLARS

371
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,377

372
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,384
CALL IT EVEN?

373
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,887
OKAY.

374
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,390

383
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,411
YOU KNOW THE HOTELS?

384
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,913

OKAY, SHE CAN'T GO.

393
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,431
ROSS, YOU CAN'T TELL HER NOT TO GO.

394
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,933
YOU JUST STARTED DATING.

395
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,934
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

396
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,936
NOTHING. YOU JUST HAVE TO BE COOL WITH IT.

397
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,437

YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M PROBABLY JUST OVERREACTING.

405
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,959
IT'S JUST SHE'S STAYING AT THIS PARTY HOTEL ON THE BEACH

406
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,461
WITH A HUGE POOL AND FREE DRINKS WITH EVERY MEAL.

407
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,963
IF SHE'S GOT ENOUGH MONEY FOR THAT

408
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,465
SHE CAN CERTAINLY PAY FOR THE FRIDGE SHE BROKE.

409
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,974
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE GOING ON THIS TRIP.

00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,485
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW

415
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,989

416
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,992
HEY, I KNOW ANOTHER GREAT WAY TO BLOW OFF STEAM.

417
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:33,993

424
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,512
IT'S A BATHING SUIT.

425
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,015
TO WEAR IN FRONT OF PEOPLE?

426
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,517
IS THAT SUPPORTIVE?

427
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,019
IS THIS?

428
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,522
HEY.

429
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,024
HEY.

00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,026
WE'RE REALLY GLAD YOU DECIDED TO MEET OUR GUY.

00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,528
YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE HIM SO MUCH.

432
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,030
WHEN DO YOU WANT TO MEET HIM?

433
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,031
I DON'T KNOW.

434
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,033
I DON'T WORK LATE TOMORROW NIGHT.

435
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,535
TOMORROW NIGHT IS GOOD. TOMORROW NIGHT IS GOOD.

436
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,536
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

437
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,538
WHY PUT OFF SOMETHING TILL TOMORROW

438
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,539
YOU COULD DO RIGHT NOW?

439
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,041
ELDAD, COME HERE.

440
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:24,543
ELDAD, THIS IS RACHEL.

441
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:25,544
HOW ARE YOU?

442
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,046
WELL, A LITTLE BLINDSIDED

443
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,547
BUT, YOU KNOW, GOOD.

444
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,549
ELDAD, SIT DOWN.

445
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,551
MOVE OVER. MOVE OVER NOW.

446
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,053
THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU ARE.

447
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,556
OKAY, OKAY, WE CAN TAKE A HINT.

448
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,061
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

449
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,063
THIS IS PATRICK. HI.

450
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,564
OKAY, YOU'RE TOO LATE, OKAY

451
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,566
BECAUSE SHE'S ALREADY WITH OUR GUY.

452
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,567
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT.

453
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,069
I AM TOO LATE.

454
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,571
THEY'RE SITTING ON THE COUCH AND TALKING.

455
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,572
COME ON.

456
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,074
RACHEL.

457
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,075
YEAH?

458
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,576
THIS IS PATRICK.

459
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,578
OH, HI.

460
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,580
THIS IS THE GUY I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

461
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,083
AND BELIEVE ME, THIS SUIT DOES NOT DO JUSTICE

462
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,085
TO WHAT'S UNDERNEATH IT.

463
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,088
OKAY...

464
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,089
BUT, PHEEBS...

465
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,591
I'M JUST SORT OF IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

466
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,093
OH, OKAY, YEAH, THAT'S OKAY.

467
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,094
HAVE A SEAT.

468
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,595
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

469
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,597
MAYBE I SHOULD GO.

470
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,599
SIT DOWN. WE'RE WINNING.

471
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,601
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE I SHOULD GO.

472
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,103
NO! NO! NO! NO!

473
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,104
YOU HAVE A SEAT.

474
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,106
RACHEL, RACHEL, YOU HAVEN'T TOUCHED

475
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,107
ELDAD'S HAIR.

476
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,609
IT IS THE SOFTEST HAIR.

477
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,610
I'M GOOD.

478
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,612
RACHEL, PATRICK IS REALLY RICH.

479
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,114
GIVE HER SOME MONEY.

480
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,115
WHAT?

481
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,117
UH... YOU KNOW WHAT, PHOEBE.

482
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,619
THIS ISN'T REALLY WORTH THE FREE MASSAGE.

483
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,621
THAT'S RIGHT, PATRICK. BYE BYE.

484
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,623
ELDAD IS MUCH MORE COOPERATIVE

485
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,125
AND HE CAN DANCE.

486
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,126
YOU DANCE FOR RACHEL.

487
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,127
OH, MY GOD...

488
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,628
NO, NO, NO, DON'T DANCE FOR ME!

489
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,629
PLEASE, DON'T DANCE.

490
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,132
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU GUYS?

491
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,634
YEAH, OKAY, LET'S TALK IT OUT.

492
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,637
AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT THIS IS EMBARRASSING FOR?

493
00:18:59,138 --> 00:18:59,638
I'M EMBARRASSED.

494
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,140
SHH, SHH, SHH.

495
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,641
I'LL TELL YOU

496
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,144
WHO SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED-- IT'S YOU GUYS.

497
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,146
COME ON, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

498
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,648
THANK YOU, BUT I DO NOT NEED YOU TO GET ME A DATE.

499
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,150
THEN WHY DID SHE ASK US...?

500
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,151
I AM STILL TALKING!

501
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,653
AND THEN YOU CHASE AWAY THE ONE GUY

502
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,155
THAT I ACTUALLY LIKED.

503
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,157
I MEAN, NO OFFENSE TO YOU GUYS, REALLY.

504
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,659
I MEAN, CONGRATULATIONS ON... ALL THE CASH.

505
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,162
AND... AND... YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY

506
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,164
WOW, YOU DO HAVE VERY SOFT HAIR.

507
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,167
BUT I WOULD MUCH RATHER  GO TO THE BALL ALL BY MYSELF

508
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,169
THAN GO THROUGH ANY MORE OF THIS.

509
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,170
GOOD BYE.

510
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,174
NOW, DO YOU USE SOME SORT

511
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,176
OF SPECIAL CONDITIONER ON THAT HAIR?

512
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,178
YES. PAPAYA EXTRACT.

513
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,679
THANK YOU.

514
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,187
SO, UH, HAVE A GREAT TIME DOWN THERE.

515
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,688
I WILL.

516
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,690
DID YOU PACK THAT BATHING SUIT?

517
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,192
YEAH.

518
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,694
IT WAS PRETTY FUNNY WHEN I HID IT FOR A WHILE, HUH?

519
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,700
ANYWAY, UM...

520
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,703
I AM WORRIED ABOUT THAT BATHING SUIT.

521
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,705
NOT BECAUSE IT'S REVEALING

522
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,207
WHICH I'M FINE WITH.

523
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,210
NO, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR HEALTH...

524
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,711
UM, SUN EXPOSURE.

525
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,213
OH, DON'T WORRY.

526
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,714
I HAVE PLENTY OF SUNBLOCK.

527
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,216
IT'S SPF 30.

528
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,218
WELL, IF WHAT'S IN THE BOTTLE

529
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,219
IS ACTUALLY 30.

530
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,221
I MEAN, SOMETIMES YOU GET 30

531
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,222
SOMETIMES IT'S FOUR.

532
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,723
AND I SWEAR TO GOD

533
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,226
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, IT'S JUST MILK.

534
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,228
ROSS, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

535
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,230
I'M NOT GOING DOWN THERE

536
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,732
TO HOOK UP WITH A BUNCH OF GUYS.

537
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,234
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

538
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,236
I LIKE HOW THINGS ARE GOING BETWEEN US.

539
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,237
REALLY?

540
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,739
YEAH. I'M JUST GOING DOWN THERE TO RELAX

541
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,241
AND HANG OUT WITH MY FRIENDS.

542
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,744
OKAY. COOL.

543
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,246
OH, HEY, HERE THEY ARE.

544
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,747
HEY, ELIZABETH!

545
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,251

546
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,760
CALL ME.

547
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,767
RACHEL, WE'RE SORRY FOR PUSHING

548
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,269
THOSE GUYS ON YOU.

549
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,270
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

550
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,771
I ENDED UP HAVING A REALLY GOOD TIME.

551
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,273
THE CHARITY WAS A BIG SUCCESS

552
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,275
AND THEY RAISED A LOT OF MONEY AND AWARENESS.

553
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,776
SO WHAT WAS IT FOR, ANYWAY?

554
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,281
I WANT TO SAY A DISEASE.

555
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,784
HEY.

556
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,787
I GOT THIS REALLY WEIRD MESSAGE FROM ROSS.

557
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,289
HE SAID TURN ON MTV.

558
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,291
ALL RIGHT.

559
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,295
OH, MY GOD! LOOK!

560
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,297
THAT'S ELIZABETH!

561
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,808
OH, OH, PROFESSOR GELLER.

562
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,813
AH, TO BE 13 AGAIN.
