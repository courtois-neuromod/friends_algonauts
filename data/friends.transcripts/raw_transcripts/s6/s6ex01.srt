1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,506
OKAY, THIS IS IT.

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,008
YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,509

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,014
HELLO, MRS. ROSS!

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,517
WHY, HELLO, MR. RACHEL!

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,026
WHOA!

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,027
OH, MY GOD.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,528

9
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,030
COME ON, PHEEBS! HURRY! HURRY! HURRY UP!

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,531
YEAH, YEAH, OKAY.

11
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,532
HURRY! HURRY!

12
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,535
OH, MY GOD!

13
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,537
IS EVERYBODY GETTING MARRIED?!

14
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,042
NO RUNNING IN THE CHAPEL.

15
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,044
HEY, DON'T YOU GIVE ME ANY OF YOUR...

16
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,045
HEY!

17
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,546
HEY.

18
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,548
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

19
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,050
ROSS AND RACHEL LEFT US A MESSAGE

20
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,551
SAYING THEY WERE GETTING MARRIED.

21
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,053
ISN'T THAT WHY YOU GUYS ARE HERE?

22
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,054
YES. WELL, YES...

23
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,556
WHY ELSE WOULD WE BE HERE?

24
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,559
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

25
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,061
DID WE MISS IT?

26
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,562
WE ACTUALLY MISSED IT.

27
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,064
WELL, MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE

28
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,565
IF YOU COULD RUN IN THE CHAPEL!

29
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,069
I CAN'T BELIEVE ROSS AND RACHEL GOT MARRIED.

30
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,571
I KNOW. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY WERE DATING AGAIN.

31
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,573
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE AS MUCH DATING

32
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,575
AS THEY ARE TWO BOTTLES OF VODKA

33
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,577
WALKING AROUND IN HUMAN FORM.

34
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,079
THIS IS INSANE.

35
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,580
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL, YOU KNOW?

36
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,082
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S A REAL MARRIAGE.

37
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,583
WHAT?

38
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,088
IF YOU GET MARRIED IN VEGAS, YOU'RE ONLY MARRIED IN VEGAS.

39
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,090
 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

40
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,093
IF YOU GET MARRIED IN VEGAS, YOU'RE MARRIED EVERYWHERE.

41
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,095
REALLY?

42
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,097
YEAH.

43
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,599
OH, MY GOD.

44
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,101
EH, WELL.

45
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:47,607

46
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:53,113
??  ? ?

47
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,115
??  ??

48
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,617
??  ? ?

49
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:02,622
??  ??

51
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,128
??  ??

52
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,131
??  ? ?

53
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,634
??  ??

54
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,646

55
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,148
MMM...

56
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,153
OH.

57
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,162

58
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,164

59
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,166

60
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,177
WHY ARE WE IN BED TOGETHER?

61
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,179
I DON'T KNOW.

62
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,181
DID WE...?

63
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,682
I DON'T KNOW.

64
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,185
DO YOU... DO YOU HAVE

65
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,686
ANY CLOTHES ON?

66
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,688
YES.

67
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,189
REALLY?

68
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,190
NO.

69
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,195
BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE...

70
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,699
SEX, DID WE?

71
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,201
I DON'T...

72
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:25,705
I DON'T REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

73
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,707
IT WAS SUCH A BLUR.

74
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,708
OH!

75
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,710
I REMEMBER LAUGHING.

76
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,212
I LAUGHED A LOT.

77
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,214
THEN WE DIDN'T HAVE SEX.

78
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:41,221
SO WHAT... WHAT DID WE DO LAST NIGHT?

79
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,223
I DON'T KNOW

80
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,225
BUT I THINK IT WAS A LOT OF FUN.

81
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:4,226
YEAH.

82
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,228
LUCKILY, NOT TOO MUCH FUN, RIGHT?

83
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,729
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

84
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,730
OH, THANK GOD.

85
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,233

86
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,237
OH, I MEAN, WE WERE REALLY DRUNK.

87
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,739
I'M GLAD WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING STUPID.

88
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,741
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

89
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,247
MORNING, PHEEBS.

90
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,248
HEY.

91
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,252
WELL, MY MOVIE HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY CANCELED.

92
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,753
JOEY, I'M SO SORRY.

93
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,756
YOU WANT SOME OF MY BREAKFAST?

94
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,758
NAH. I'M TOO DEPRESSED TO EAT.

95
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,761
I'LL PROBABLY BE EATING IN, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES.

96
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,264
SO I GUESS I'LL JUST FLY HOME WITH YOU GUYS.

97
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,765
WHAT TIME'S YOUR FLIGHT?

98
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,766
WHAT ABOUT MY CAB?

99
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,768
I DON'T NEED THAT ANYMORE.

100
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,770
NO, JOEY, YOU BORROWED MY CAB.

101
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,272
YOU HAVE TO DRIVE IT BACK.

102
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,275
I DON'T WANT TO DRIVE ALL THE WAY BACK BY MYSELF.

103
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,276
I GET SO LONELY.

104
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,278
OH, OH, HOW ABOUT IF YOU COME WITH ME?

105
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,780
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S SUCH A LONG TRIP.

106
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,781
IT'LL BE GREAT.

107
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,783
WE CAN TALK AND PLAY GAMES, HUH?

108
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,787
THIS COULD BE OUR CHANCE TO, LIKE, RENEW OUR FRIENDSHIP.

109
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,291
ARE YOU ASKING ME TO HAVE A FRIEND AISSANCE?

110
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,294
SURE?

111
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,795
ALL RIGHT.

112
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,298
ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK WE REALLY NEED ONE, BABY.

113
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,799
I NEVER STOPPED LOVING YOU.

114
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,801
HEY.

115
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,303
 HEY.

116
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,805
SO HAS ANYBODY TALKED TO DR. AND MRS. GELLER YET?

117
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,307
MM HMM. YEAH.

118
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,308
THEY LEFT ME A MESSAGE.

119
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,809
THEY SHOULD BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

120
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,311
WHERE IS THE WAITRESS?

121
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,812
I'M STARVING.

122
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,316
IT'S A BUFFET, MAN.

123
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,819
OH, HERE'S WHERE I WIN ALL MY MONEY BACK.

124
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,324
LISTEN, I GOT TO TALK TO YOU.

125
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,326
SURE. WHAT'S UP?

126
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,337
MONICA AND I ALMOST GOT MARRIED LAST NIGHT.

127
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,338
OH, MY GOD!

128
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,839
THAT'S HUGE!

129
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,342
HEY!

130
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,343
WAIT A MINUTE.

131
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,345
WHY WASN'T I INVITED?

132
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,346
AND WHO WAS GOING TO BE

133
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,847
YOUR BEST MAN?

134
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,848
DON'T SAY ROSS.

135
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,350
DO NOT SAY ROSS.

136
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,852
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT MONICA AND I

137
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,854
ARE READY TO GET MARRIED YET, YOU KNOW?

138
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,357
I MEAN, I LOVE HER AND EVERYTHING, BUT...

139
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,360
SEEING ROSS AND RACHEL COME OUT OF THAT CHAPEL

140
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,362
WAS LIKE A... LIKE A WAKE UP CALL

141
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,864
THAT MONICA AND I ARE MOVING SO FAST, YOU KNOW.

142
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,367
HOW DO I TELL HER WITHOUT CRUSHING HER?

143
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,369
OH.

144
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,871
TELL HER SHE'S NOT MARRIAGE MATERIAL.

145
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,376
WHAT?

146
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,878
GIRLS SAY IT TO ME ALL THE TIME.

147
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,880
AND BELIEVE ME

148
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,881
IF SHE'S ANYTHING LIKE ME

149
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,883
SHE'S JUST GOING TO BE RELIEVED.

150
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,887
HOW DO I TELL CHANDLER THAT IT'S TOO SOON?

151
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,389
IT'S GOING TO BREAK HIS HEART.

152
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,391
HE'S GOING TO THINK I DON'T LOVE HIM ANYMORE.

153
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,392
WELL, YOU DON'T.

154
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,893
YES, I DO.

155
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,895
GOOD, GOOD. I WAS JUST TESTING YOU.

156
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,897
 HI.

157
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,899
OH, HI, HI.

158
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,902
YOU KNOW, WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT BACON.

159
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,904
NO, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TENNIS.

160
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,906
TENNIS IS MORE BELIEVABLE.

161
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,410
HEY.

162
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,911
HEY. HEY.

163
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,912
HI.

164
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,415
THANK YOU.

165
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,416
COFFEE.

166
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,418
MMM!

167
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:05,925
WHAT?

168
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,427
ARE WE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

169
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,429
WHAT YOU GUYS DID LAST NIGHT, OR...?

170
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,930
WHAT... WHAT DO YOU MEAN LAST NIGHT?

171
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,931
NOTHING NOTHING...

172
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,433
NOTHING HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

173
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,934
YEAH.

174
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,935
UH HUH.

175
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,438
ROSS INVITED US ALL TO WATCH.

176
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,446
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

177
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,947
RACH, WE WEREN'T GOING TO MISS

178
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,449
OUR FRIENDS GETTING MARRIED.

179
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,951
WHO GOT MARRIED?!

180
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,954
YOU DID?

181
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,956
WHAT? WHAT?

182
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,957
WE... WE... HELLO?

183
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,959
NO, WE DIDN'T. WE DIDN'T GET MARRIED.

184
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,960
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

185
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,962

186
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,465
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

187
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,967
I REMEMBER BEING IN A CHAPEL.

188
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,970
THEY WOULD NOT LET US GET MARRIED

189
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,972
WHEN WE WERE THAT DRUNK.

190
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,475
THEY LET YOU GET MARRIED WHEN YOU'RE DRUNK.

191
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,977
MOST PEOPLE GETTING MARRIED IN VEGAS ARE DRUNK.

192
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,980
I'M DRUNK RIGHT NOW.

193
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,985
I CAN'T HAVE A MIMOSA WITH BREAKFAST?

194
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,986
I'M ON VACATION.

195
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,488
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO DO?

196
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,491
I GUESS WE JUST FIND A DIVORCE LAWYER?

197
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,992
WELL, I THINK...

198
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,494
I THINK ROSS ALREADY HAS ONE.

199
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,998
YEAH, YEAH. THAT GUY'S FINALLY GOING

200
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,500
TO BE ABLE TO PUT IN THAT POOL.

201
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,002
OKAY...

202
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,003
THIS ONE'S FREE, RIGHT?

203
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,005
BECAUSE YOU PAID FOR THE FIRST TWO

204
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,507
SO YOU GET THE THIRD ONE FOR FREE.

205
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,008
LAUGH IT UP

206
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,009
BUT THE JOKE'S ON YOU.

207
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,512
BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED TO GET DIVORCED, OKAY?

208
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,014
WE'RE JUST GOING TO GET AN ANNULMENT.

209
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,015
 AN ANNULMENT?

210
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,519
ROSS, I DON'T THINK SURGERY'S THE ANSWER HERE.

211
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,523
OH, THAT'S YOUR THING.

212
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,024
WHAT?

213
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,527
YOUR THING, YOUR THING, YOU KNOW.

214
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,029
YOU'RE THE GUY WHO GETS DIVORCED.

215
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,030
OH, YEAH.

216
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,532
IT MIGHT BE TRUE.

217
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,534
IT'S NOT MY "THING."

218
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,036
I DO NOT LOVE GETTING DIVORCED.

219
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,538
YES, YOU DO.

220
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,539
THIS IS YOUR THIRD DIVORCE.

221
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,040
GOD, YOU LOVE DIVORCE SO MUCH

222
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,042
YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO MARRY IT

223
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,544
AND THEN...

224
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,047
THEN IT WON'T WORK OUT

225
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,050
SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DIVORCE IT, DIVORCING GUY.

226
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,051

227
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,553
I'M SO DRUNK.

228
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,562
YOU WANT TO PLAY SOME PAI GOW?

229
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,063
MAYBE.

230
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,565
BUT I KIND OF THINK

231
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,066
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

232
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,568
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA

233
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,070
BECAUSE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT LAST NIGHT, TOO

234
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,072
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT PAI GOW IS.

235
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,574
I SEE.

236
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,576
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO?

237
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,077
I DON'T KNOW.

238
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,579
I I I KNOW I LOVE YOU.

239
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,080
I KNOW I LOVE YOU.

240
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,087
SO WHERE ARE WE ON THE WHOLE

241
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,090
GOING BACK TO THE PLACE- WHERE THEY HAVE ALL- THE MARRIAGES THING?

242
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,592
I LOVE YOU.

243
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,595
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

244
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,597
WELL, LAST NIGHT WE LET THE DICE DECIDE.

245
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,599
MAYBE WE SHOULD LEAVE IT UP TO FATE AGAIN.

246
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,100
I LOVE YOU.

247
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,604
YES, WE DON'T GET MARRIED UNLESS THERE'S A SIGN, OKAY?

248
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,106
SO, SAY... SAY YOU ROLL ANOTHER EIGHT

249
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,608
THEN THERE IS A DEFINITE SIGN

250
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,109
THAT WE SHOULD GET MARRIED.

251
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,111
ALL RIGHT, EIGHT, WE GET MARRIED

252
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,114
BUT TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, NINE, 10, 11, 12

253
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,115
WE DON'T GET MARRIED.

254
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,617
SOUNDS GREAT. OKAY.

255
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,618
OKAY, WE GOT A SHOOTER.

256
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,119
MONEY PLAYS.

257
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,120
YOU READY?

258
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,121
READY.

259
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,123
COME ON, EIGHT.

260
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,629
YES, YES, EIGHT.

261
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,131
 EIGHT.

262
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,633
EASY EIGHT.

263
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,137
WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE I ACTUALLY ROLLED AN EIGHT.

264
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,139
THAT WAS SO UNLIKELY.

265
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,142
WELL, LET'S GET MARRIED...

266
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,644
I GUESS.

267
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,145
THAT WASN'T A HARD EIGHT.

268
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,647
LAST NIGHT, I ROLLED A HARD EIGHT.

269
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,649
THAT'S RIGHT, IT WAS THE WRONG KIND OF EIGHT.

270
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:50,650
NO WEDDING! DAMN IT!

271
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,652

272
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,154
I WANTED IT SO BAD.

273
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,656
WANT TO GO PACK?

274
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,157
YEAH.

275
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,662
WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING, RIGHT?

276
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,163
OF COURSE WE ARE.

277
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,665
WE LEFT IT UP TO FATE.

278
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,167
IF WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GET MARRIED

279
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,169
THERE WOULD BE A CLEAR CUT SIGN.

280
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,680
OKAY, YOU HAVE 19 QUESTIONS LEFT.

281
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,181
USE THEM WISELY.

282
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,184

283
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,186
COME ON, JOEY, YOU CAN'T WIN

284
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,688
IF YOU DON'T ASK ANY...

285
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,689
QUESTIONS!

286
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,691
I'M UP! WHAT?!

287
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,192
WHAT?

288
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,194
WELL, YOU PROMISED ME A FUN ROAD TRIP

289
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,196
AND WE'VE BEEN ON THE ROAD FOR SIX HOURS

290
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,198
AND YOU'VE BEEN ASLEEP FOR FIVE AND A HALF.

291
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,200
WE ARE SWITCHING AT THE NEXT REST STOP

292
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,703
AND YOU ARE GOING TO DRIVE THE WHOLE WAY BACK.

293
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,204
THAT WILL BE YOUR PUNISHMENT

294
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,706
YOU GREEDY SLEEPER.

295
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,708
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

296
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,711
AND, UNTIL THEN, YOU ARE GOING TO SING TO ME.

297
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,212
BECAUSE THE RADIO'S BROKEN

298
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,714
AND YOU ARE SELFISH

299
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,215
BUT YOU HAVE A NICE VOICE.

300
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,217
REALLY? I DON'T...

301
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,719
SING!

302
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:04,223
?? I WANNA ROCK 'N' ROLL ALL NIGHT... ??

303
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,232
 MAN, THIS IS A LONG DRIVE.

304
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,736
ARE MY EYES OPEN?

305
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,738
NO!

306
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,252

307
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,253

308
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,254
MORNING.

309
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,255

310
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,262
HEY.

311
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,764
HEY, HUBBY.

312
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,266

313
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,769
ACTUALLY, UM, I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT

314
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,270
THAT WHOLE ANNULMENT THING.

315
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,772
UH HUH?

316
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,274
YEAH, I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT.

317
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,283

318
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,285
OKAY!

319
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,789
SO... WE'LL JUST STAY MARRIED.

320
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,791
YES, EXACTLY.

321
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:16,796
AND I WILL MAKE EVERYONE CALL ME MRS. GELLER.

322
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,798
WOW, THIS IS SO AMAZING.

323
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,800
I, UH...

324
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,802
I REALLY THOUGHT I'D HAVE TO TALK YOU INTO THIS MORE.

325
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,804
OKAY, SEE, NOW I'M SCARED

326
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,307
BECAUSE I DON'T ACTUALLY THINK YOU'RE KIDDING.

327
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,310
I'M I'M NOT KIDDING.

328
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,812
LOOK, I I...

329
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,315
I CAN'T HAVE THREE FAILED MARRIAGES.

330
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,317
I CAN'T, OKAY?

331
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,821
I I I AM NOT GOING TO BE THAT GUY, OKAY?

332
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,324
NO, NO. THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE MY THING.

333
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,326
WHAT? WELL, WH WHAT...

334
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,329
SO... SO, WHAT, WE JUST STAY MARRIED FOREVER?

335
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,330
I DON'T KNOW.

336
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,832
WHA...?

337
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,835
I HAVEN'T WORKED IT ALL OUT YET, BUT...

338
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,838
LOOK, OKAY, I KNOW IT'S A BIT CRAZY...

339
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,339
YEAH. HON...

340
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,342
HOW HOW IS THIS GOING TO AFFECT YOU, REALLY?

341
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,348
I MEAN, YOU FILL SOME FORM OUT ONCE IN A WHILE.

342
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,851
INSTEAD OF CHECKING THE BOX THAT SAYS "MISS"

343
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,853
YOU CHECK THE BOX THAT SAYS "MRS."

344
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,355
IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO IT.

345
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,360
OH, OKAY, I'M SORRY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

346
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,362
YOU KNOW WHAT? WE ABSOLUTELY CAN STAY MARRIED

347
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,864
BECAUSE I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION

348
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,867
THAT THE BOXES WERE FAR AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.   349 00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,870
NO. THEY'RE RIGHT...

350
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,871
ROSS! OH!

351
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,372
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

352
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,374
JUST...

353
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,876
PLEASE, TAKE A MOMENT HERE

354
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,379
AND THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING OF ME, OKAY?

355
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:45,885
I AM ASKING YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR.

356
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:51,891
YOU ARE ASKING ME TO BE YOUR WIFE.

357
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:56,896
AND AS MY WIFE, I THINK YOU SHOULD GRANT ME THIS FAVOR.

358
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,901
WE DID MAKE VOWS.

359
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,907
THAT KID KICKED ME REALLY HARD ON THE PLANE.

360
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,909
WELL, YOU DID PULL HIS HAIR.

361
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,410
HE TOOK MY SNACK.

362
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,412
I'M NOT GETTING INTO THIS AGAIN! OKAY!

363
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,914
OH, GOD, YOU KNOW WHAT?

364
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,915
IT HURTS REALLY BAD.

365
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,917
WELL, I TOLD YOU NOT TO WALK...

366
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,918
HERE. HERE.

367
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,419
OKAY.

368
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,930
THIS DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING, DOES IT?

369
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,931
NO.

370
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,432
OKAY.

371
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,436
HOW COULD YOU PICK UP A HITCHHIKER?

372
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,438
HE COULD BE A RAP...

373
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,942
HE COULD BE A RAPIST OR A KILLER OR SOMETHING.

374
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,445
DON'T YOU THINK I ASKED HIM THAT BEFORE HE GOT IN?

375
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,447
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

376
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,949
YOU GO BACK TO SLEEP. AND YOU--

377
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:50,950
ARE YOU A RAPIST?

378
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,451
NO.

379
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,953
DO YOU LIKE CAR GAMES?

380
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,455
YEAH. YOU KNOW, THE, UH, LICENSE PLATE GAME?

381
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,457
I LOVE THE LICENSE PLATE GAME.

382
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,959
OH, I'LL PLAY. I'LL PLAY.

383
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,962
NO, NO. YOU NEED YOUR SLEEP. NIGHT, NIGHT.

384
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,463
SHH!

385
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:09,969
HEY.

386
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,971
HEY. LISTEN.

387
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,472
I KNOW YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME

388
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,476
BUT I HAVE AN IDEA THAT MAY MAKE YOU WANT TO STAY MARRIED.

389
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:23,983
WE REGISTER, AND YOU GET TO KEEP ALL THE PRESENTS.

390
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:27,987
NO.

391
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,488
ROSS, COME ON.

392
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,990
NO. LISTEN. LOOK, I'VE THOUGHT A LOT

393
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,992
ABOUT HOW TO TELL YOU THIS AND, UM...

394
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,493
ACTUALLY, I CAME UP WITH AN ANALOGY

395
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,995
ABOUT A LITTLE GOLDFISH IN A POND

396
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,496
THAT FREEZES OVER IN THE WINTER.

397
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,498
THEN I REALIZED THAT WAS MORE OF A STORY

398
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,000
ABOUT WHAT TO DO WHEN PEOPLE PICK ON YOU

399
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,002
SO I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO SAVE THAT ONE

400
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,003
FOR MY CHILDREN'S BOOK.

401
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,005
RACH, WHAT'S UP?

402
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,506
OH, SORRY. OKAY.

403
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:52,011
THE BOTTOM LINE, ROSS,  IS WE CANNOT STAY MARRIED.

404
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,513
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE.

405
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,015
BUT IT IT IT IS.

406
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,518
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

407
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:03,522
THIS IS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.

408
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,526
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS IN A MARRIAGE...

409
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,028
OH, ROSS, COME ON! THIS IS NOT A...

410
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,529
THIS IS NOT A MARRIAGE.

411
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,531
THIS IS THE WORLD'S WORST HANGOVER!

412
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,533
ROSS, LISTEN.

413
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,036
IF YOU DO NOT GET THIS ANNULMENT, I WILL.

414
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,040
ALL RIGHT.

415
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,541
ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO IT.

416
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,044
THANK YOU.

417
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,545
HEY HEY, UM...

418
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,048
UH, IS THERE ANY SUCH THING

419
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,550
AS AN ANNULMENT SHOWER?

420
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,054
 OH, WAIT, WAIT.

421
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,555
THERE'S THE TRAIN STATION.

422
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,557
THIS IS WHERE I GET OFF.

423
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,559
I HAVE YOUR ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBER.

424
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,560
AND I HAVE YOUR NAME

425
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,563
AND THE FACT THAT YOU'RE A DRIFTER, SO...

426
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,066
BALL'S PRETTY MUCH IN YOUR COURT.

427
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,067
ALL RIGHT.

428
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,568
SEE YOU, PHEEBS.

429
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,577
COME ON, PHEEBS.

430
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,079
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

431
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,081
PLEASE TALK TO ME.

432
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,586
LET LET ME MAKE IT UP TO YOU, HUH?

433
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:12,091
?
?? GROUND CONTROL TO MAJOR TOM ?

434
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:17,096
?? COMMENCING COUNTDOWN, ENGINES ON ??

435
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:25,104
?? TAKE YOUR PROTEIN PILLS AND PUT YOUR HELMET ON ??

436
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,605

437
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,107
STOP IT! ?? THIS IS GROUND... ??

438
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,608
STOP IT! NO!

439
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,610
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

440
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,114
YOU KNOW I CAN'T RESIST THAT BEAUTIFUL VOICE.

441
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,617
PHEEBS, LOOK, I'M SO SORRY.

442
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,620
I KNOW I PROMISED YOU A FUN ROAD TRIP WITH YOUR FRIEND

443
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,623
AND I DIDN'T DELIVER, OKAY, BUT BUT BUT NOW I KNOW

444
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,625
THAT YOU THINK BEING AWAKE

445
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,628
IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF FRIENDSHIP, SO...

446
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,629
SO...

447
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,631
SO I WILL STRIVE TO TO STAY AWAKE

448
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,633
FOR AS LONG AS I KNOW YOU.

449
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,638
YOU CAN STILL, LIKE, SLEEP AT NIGHT AND STUFF.

450
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,640
WELL, THANK YOU.

451
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,642
SO, CAN WE PLAY 20 QUESTIONS NOW?

452
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,644
I GOT A REALLY GOOD ONE.

453
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,647
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT SINCE KANSAS.

454
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,649
OKAY.

455
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:15,154
IS IT... A KIND OF HOT SANDWICH?

456
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,157
YES.

457
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,159
IS IT A MEATBALL SUB?

458
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,161
THAT IS INCREDIBLE.

459
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,664
YOU ARE THE MASTER.

460
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,667
BUG!

461
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,178
ENOUGH ALREADY.

462
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,679
WELL, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO CATCH THEM.

463
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,181
THAT'S FUNNY.

464
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,683
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE NEXT ONE...

465
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,684
DON'T SAY IT.

466
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,686
DON'T EVEN THINK IT.

467
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,188
ALL RIGHT.

468
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,690
OKAY, CHANDLER, ENJOY YOUR HANDFUL.

469
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,694
ALL RIGHT, SHOULD WE JUST...

470
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,696
SHOULD WE JUST GET MARRIED, YOU KNOW?

471
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,198
I MEAN, SHOULD WE JUST DO IT?

472
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,699
ALL THE SIGNS ARE TELLING US TO DO IT.

473
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,701
I'M SICK OF THE SIGNS. IT'S TOO FAST.

474
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,703
ME, TOO. I'M HAPPY THE WAY THINGS ARE.

475
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,705
I DON'T WANT THINGS TO CHANGE; DO YOU?

476
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,206
NO.

477
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,207
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

478
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:08,707
THEN NOTHING CHANGES!

479
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:09,708
EVERYTHING IS GREAT!

480
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,210
EVERYTHING STAYS THE SAME!

481
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,712
NOW, YOU GO AND UNPACK BECAUSE IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS

482
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,214
AND IT'S DRIVING ME INSANE.

483
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,215
AH, GEEZ, RELAX.

484
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,716
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE MA...

485
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,717
AH! AH!

486
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,720

487
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:32,731
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING, WHAT IF I, UH, UNPACK HERE?

488
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,733
THEN ALL YOUR STUFF WOULD BE HERE.

489
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,738
WELL...

490
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,741
WHAT IF ALL MY STUFF WAS HERE?

491
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,744
THEN YOU'D BE GOING BACK AND FORTH ALL THE TIME.

492
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,745
I MEAN...

493
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,747
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

494
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,750
OKAY.

495
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,252
WHAT IF WE LIVE TOGETHER

496
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,255
AND YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?

497
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,259
LIVE TOGETHER?

498
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,762
THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNS FOR THAT.

499
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,765
ME ASKING IS KIND OF A SIGN.

500
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,770
YES!

501
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,771
YES! OKAY!

502
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,772
YES!

503
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,775
YES!

504
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,277
YES. OKAY. OKAY, WAIT.

505
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,278
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.

506
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,279
OKAY.

507
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,280
OKAY. HERE'S YOUR KEY.

508
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,781
OKAY. HERE'S YOUR KEY.

509
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,284
ALL RIGHT, NOW, YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND CHRISTEN IT.

510
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,785
NOW, GO OUT AND THEN COME BACK IN.

511
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,788
THE DOOR HASN'T BEEN LOCKED IN FIVE YEARS, BUT OKAY.

512
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,790
READY?

513
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,292
READY!

514
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,793
OKAY, A LITTLE PROBLEM.

515
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,795
THE KEY BROKE IN THE LOCK, AND I CAN'T GET IN.

516
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,797
OH, MY GOD. I CAN'T GET OUT.

517
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,798
THIS ISN'T A SIGN.

518
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,300
NO, NO, NO. IT'S NOT A SIGN.

519
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,801
IT'S A VERY OLD KEY.

520
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,802
IT'S JUST AN OLD KEY!

521
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,304
OH, MY GOD, IT'S OLD.

522
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,306
I LOVE YOU.

523
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,309
I LOVE YOU.

524
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,313
ARE YOU HUGGING THE DOOR RIGHT NOW?

525
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,320
NO.

526
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,323
YEAH, YEAH. ME NEITHER.

527
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,327
HEY.

528
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,329
HEY. SO, DID EVERYTHING GO ALL RIGHT

529
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,830
WITH THE, UH, ANNULMENT?

530
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,831
OH, YEAH.

531
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,833
NO PROBLEMS. IT'S ALL TAKEN CARE OF.

532
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,335
ROSS, THANK YOU. AAH...

533
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,338
HEY, DO YOU GUYS WANT TO GO SEE A MOVIE?

534
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,339
OH, YEAH. WHY NOT?

535
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,340
YEAH. PHEEBS?

536
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,841
NO, THANKS.

537
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,842
I'VE ALREADY SEEN ONE.

538
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,844
OKAY. UM...

539
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:26,845
I'M GOING TO GET MY SWEATER.

540
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,347
OKAY.

541
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,352
YOU WANT YOU WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING WEIRD?

542
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,853
ALWAYS.

543
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,857
I DIDN'T GET THE ANNULMENT.

544
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,360
WHAT?

545
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,862
WE'RE STILL MARRIED.

546
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,364
DON'T TELL RACHEL.

547
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,365
SEE YOU LATER.

548
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,879
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

549
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,381
KEY'S STUCK IN THE LOCK.

550
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,882
I CAN FIX IT. HOLD ON.

551
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,386
WATCH OUT. WATCH OUT.

552
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,394
STILL DOESN'T WORK.

553
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,395
I'M NOT FINISHED.

554
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,896
OH.

555
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:28,907
NICE JOB, JOE.

556
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,909
YOU'RE QUITE THE CRAFTSMAN.
