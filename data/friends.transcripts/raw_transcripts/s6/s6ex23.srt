1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,005
PHEEBS, CAN YOU HELP ME PICK OUT

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,506
AN ENGAGEMENT RING FOR MONICA?

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,508
I CAN'T FIGURE THIS OUT. IT'S SO HARD.

4
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:12,012
SHOULD I GET HER A TIFFANY CUT OR A PRINCESS CUT OR A... OW!

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,513
PAPER CUT!

6
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,015
NOW, HAVE YOU TOLD ANYONE ELSE?

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,516
NO. I DON'T WANT TO TELL ANYBODY ELSE

8
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,518
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT MONICA TO FIND OUT.

9
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,519
YOU TOLD ME.

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,021
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE I TRUST YOU

11
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,522
AND YOU'RE ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS

12
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,523
AND YOU WALKED IN ON ME

13
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,025
WHILE I WAS LOOKING AT RING BROCHURES.

14
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,528
YEAH, WELL, ONCE AGAIN, NOT KNOCKING PAYS OFF.

15
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,531
I ONLY WISH YOU HADN'T BEEN ON THE TOILET.

16
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,033
ME, TOO.

17
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,534
NOW, LET ME SEE.

18
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,536
IS THERE SUCH A THING AS A MONICA CUT?

19
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,039
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE YOUR BEST BET.

20
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,041
HEY. HEY. HEY.

21
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,042
SO, CHANDLER, WANT TO GO

22
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,043
TO THE COFFEEHOUSE?

23
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,044
OH, ALL RIGHT.

24
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,545
YEAH, COFFEEHOUSE.

25
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,546
PERFECT. WE WERE JUST GOING

26
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,048
TO SEE IF YOU WANTED TO GO.

27
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,051
OH, WELL, WE DON'T BECAUSE WE GOT THE OTHER PLACE.

28
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,056
HOW RUDE.

29
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,057
OH, I'M SORRY.

30
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,558
YOU WANT A BITE?    40 00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:41,101 SO HOW ARE THINGS GOING WITH PAUL?

41
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,602
GOOD.

42
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,604
ALTHOUGH, YOU KNOW, HE'S A PRIVATE GUY.

43
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,106
YOU KNOW, I WISH I COULD GET HIM

44
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,608
TO OPEN UP A LITTLE BIT, SHARE SOME FEELINGS.

45
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,609
THAT'S EASY.

46
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,111
YOU JUST HAVE TO THINK OF HIM

47
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,613
AS A JAR OF PICKLES THAT WON'T OPEN.

48
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,116
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

49
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,617
I SHOULD RUN HIM UNDER SOME HOT WATER

50
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,619
AND BANG HIS HEAD AGAINST THE TABLE?

51
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,620
NO. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO

52
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,623
WHEN YOU WANT TO GET THE TRUTH OUT OF SOMEONE.

53
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,125

54
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,629
HI, HONEY. HI.

55
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,630
WATCH THIS.

56
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,631
OKAY.

57
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,133
HEY, PAUL. HI, PHOEBE.

58
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,135
SO, HOW ARE THINGS GOING WITH YOU?

59
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,637
CAN'T COMPLAIN.

60
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,640

61
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,644
LET'S GO. OKAY.

62
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,645
HEY! HI!

63
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,647
ROSS, GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.

64
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,149
HOW YOU DOING? GOOD. BYE.

65
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,650
OKAY, YOU TAKE CARE.

66
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,651
YEAH!

67
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,652
EW.

68
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,657
HEY, PHEEBS, WHAT WAS THE DEAL

69
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,659
WITH YOU AND CHANDLER BLOWING US OFF BEFORE?

70
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,661
YEAH, IT WAS SO WEIRD, HUH?

71
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,164
PHOEBE, WHY'D YOU DO IT?

72
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,166
I DIDN'T DO IT.

73
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,667
IT WAS CHANDLER.

74
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,669
HE'S... HE'S MAD AT YOU.

75
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,172
WHA...? WHY?

76
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,674
PLEASE. I THINK YOU KNOW WHY.

77
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,177
CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING.

78
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,178
COME ON, ROSS.

79
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,180
YOU'RE A PALEONTOLOGIST.

80
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,681
DIG A LITTLE DEEPER.

81
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,184
WAIT A MINUTE.

82
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,186
IS IT BECAUSE JOEY AND I DIDN'T INVITE HIM

83
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,188
TO THAT KNICKS GAME A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO?

84
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,191
DO YOU THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HE'D BE MAD AT YOU FOR?

85
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,693
I GUESS IT COULD.

86
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,695
WELL, THEN, I THINK THAT'S IT.

87
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,197
WELL, IF HE'S ANGRY

88
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,199
HE REALLY SHOULDN'T JUST COVER IT UP.

89
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,201
I WISH HE WOULD JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH.

90
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,702
OH, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT

91
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,704
THEN YOU REALLY SHOULD RUN HIM UNDER HOT WATER

92
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,706
AND BANG HIS HEAD AGAINST THE TABLE.

93
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,711
HONEY, I MADE A RESERVATION AT CHINA GARDEN.

94
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,712
IS THAT OKAY?

95
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,214
YEAH. NO, THAT'S GREAT.

96
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,217
BUT FIRST, WAIT. TALK TO ME, TALK TO ME.

97
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,218
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR DAY.

98
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,720
IT WAS FINE.

99
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,223
OKAY.

100
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,225

101
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,226
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

102
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,727
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING RIGHT NOW?

103
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,230
I'M THINKING THAT YOU ARE LOOKING REALLY FINE

104
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,731
IN THAT DRESS.

105
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,733
YOU KNOW, THAT'S GREAT, PAUL

106
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,736
BUT YOU KNOW, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT...

107
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,738
WOW! THOSE ARE REALLY GREAT.

108
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,244
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS

109
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,747
BEHIND THIS STRONG, SILENT EXTERIOR.

110
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,750
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THAT STILL WATERS RUN DEEP

111
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,252
AND I WANT TO SWIM IN YOURS.

112
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:16,256
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT HAVING SEX?

113
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,757
NO.

114
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:21,261
PAUL, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.

115
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,762
YOU KNOW, LIKE YOUR CHILDHOOD.

116
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,764
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD.

117
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,765
NORMAL.

118
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,267
OKAY.

119
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,768
WELL, THEN HOW ABOUT PUBERTY? COME ON.

120
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,770
THAT'S ALWAYS A PAINFUL TIME.

121
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,273
YOU KNOW, YOUR FRIENDS INVITE YOU TO A SLUMBER PARTY

122
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,275
AND THEN THEY STICK YOUR HAND IN WARM WATER

123
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,777
WHILE YOU'RE SLEEPING

124
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,779
SO YOU PEEIN YOUR SLEEPING BAG?

125
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,781
NOPE. THAT NEVER HAPPENED TO ME.

126
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,283
WELL, YOU'RE LUCKY

127
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,287
YOU NEVER MET THAT BITCH SHARON MAJESKI.

128
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,290
ANYWAY, UM, THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

129
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,791
YOU KNOW, ANY REGRETS?

130
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,794
NOPE.

131
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,795
ALL RIGHT, PAUL.

132
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,298
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT ASKING FOR A LOT HERE, OKAY?

133
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,299
JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING.

134
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,300
ANYTHING.

135
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,801
OKAY.

136
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,303
OKAY.

137
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,807
WHEN I WAS SIX YEARS OLD...

138
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,808
MM HMM.

139
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,809
I WANTED A BIG WHEEL.

140
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,312
AND, INSTEAD, MY PARENTS GOT ME

141
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,316
THIS LITTLE PLASTIC CHICKEN THAT YOU HOP AROUND ON.

142
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,317
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.

143
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,818
KIDS MADE FUN OF ME.

144
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,819
OH.

145
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,821
THAT WAS A PRETTY TOUGH YEAR.

146
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,323
THAT'S GREAT. SEE?

147
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,326
I ALREADY FEEL LIKE I KNOW YOU

148
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,827
A LITTLE BETTER.

149
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,828
THANK YOU.

150
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,829
OKAY. COME ON.

151
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,330
NOW WE CAN GO EAT.

152
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,831
LET'S GO.

153
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,835
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

154
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:42,342
THEY CALLED ME "CHICKEN BOY."

155
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,845

156
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,348
AND, IN FIFTH GRADE, I GOT INTO A FIGHT.

157
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,350
WELL, IT WASN'T REALLY A FIGHT.

158
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,354
RICHARD DARUMBULL BIT ME ON THE NOSE AND I FELL DOWN.

159
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,856
I STILL HAVE A LITTLE SCAR RIGHT HERE.

160
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,857
YOU CAN SEE IT.

161
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,360
YEAH. YEAH, I SEE THE SCAR.

162
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,862
LISTEN, PAUL, I THINK THIS IS REALLY GREAT

163
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,865
THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE SHARED YOUR FEELINGS.

164
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,867
REALLY, IT'S BEAUTIFUL

165
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,371
BUT, UM, WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO SHARE SOME FOOD?

166
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,872
OH, I COULDN'T EAT NOW.

167
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,874
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

168
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,876
YOU LOVE THEIR KUNG PAO CHICKEN.

169
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,879
"CHICKEN"?

170
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,884
"CHICKEN BOY"!

171
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,885
I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY.

172
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,387
I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THIS.

173
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,388

174
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:34,894
NOTHING. THIS IS

175
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,396
THE NINE MILLIONTH RING STORE WE'VE BEEN TO

176
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:37,897
AND I CAN'T FIND THE PERFECT RING.

177
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:42,402
UGLY RING, UGLY RING, UGLY RING.

178
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,406
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SELECTION.

179
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,411
OKAY, SO MAYBE YOU DON'T GET HER A RING.

180
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,912
MAYBE YOU DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

181
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,414
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU GET HER

182
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,915
AN ENGAGEMENT BRACELET, YOU KNOW?

183
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,417
OR AN ENGAGEMENT TIARA.

184
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:02,922
OH, AN ENGAGEMENT REVOLUTIONARY WAR MUSKET.

185
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,925
YOU KNOW, I'M SO GLAD I PICKED YOU TO HELP ME WITH THIS.

186
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,926
HUH?

187
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,429
CAN'T YOU JUST IMAGINE GETTING DOWN ON ONE KNEE

188
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,432
AND HANDING HER THIS GORGEOUS PIECE OF WEAPONRY?

189
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,435
YEAH, I'M GOING TO STICK WITH THE RING.

190
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,437
OH, THIS ONE'S NICE.

191
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,938
I LIKE THIS ONE.

192
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,440
SIR, UH, KIND SIR?

193
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,442

194
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,944
THIS IS THE REASON YOU BROUGHT ME, OKAY?

195
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,446
I KNOW HOW TO HAGGLE

196
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,448
SO LET ME HANDLE THIS FROM HERE ON OUT.

197
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,949
CAN I HELP YOU? UH, YES.

198
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,452

IT'S A 100 CARAT DIAMOND

202
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,960
WITH SAPPHIRES ON EITHER SIDE.

203
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,462
SIR, COULD I ASK YOU TO, UM...

204
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,466
COULD YOU HOLD OUT THAT RING AND ASK ME TO MARRY YOU?

205
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,469
OKAY.

206
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,473
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

207
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,475
OH, MY GOD. THAT'S IT.

208
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,976
THAT'S THE RING.

209
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:58,978
HOW MUCH IS IT?

210
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,480
CHANDLER, I WILL HANDLE THIS.

211
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,982
HOW MUCH IS IT?

212
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,984
$8,600 DOLLARS.

213
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,487
WE WILL GIVE YOU TEN DOLLARS.

214
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,490
ARE YOU INTEREST ED IN THIS RING?

215
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,493
YES. YES, BUT I CAN ONLY PAY $8,000 DOLLARS.

216
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,995
OKAY. I CAN LET  IT GO FOR $8,000 DOLLARS.

217
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,997
WE STAND FIRM AT TEN DOLLARS.

218
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,999
HOW WOULD  YOU LIKE TO PAY?

219
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,000

220
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,002
OH, NO. BUT I LENT MY CREDIT CARD TO JOEY.

OKAY, I'LL GO GET IT.

222
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,506
YOU GUARD THE RING.

223
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,007
WHY DID YOU GIVE YOUR CREDIT CARD TO JOEY?

224
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,510
I GAVE IT TO HIM TO BUY SOME KNICKS TICKETS.

225
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,512
THEN THE JERK DIDN'T EVEN INVITE ME TO THE GAME.

226
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,013
BUT I'M OVER IT. WHATEVER!

227
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,519
LISTEN, I'M SORRY ABOUT BEFORE.

228
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,021
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING HERE FOR TEN DOLLARS?

229
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,022
UH, YES.

230
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,024
I HAVE THESE TWO

231
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,528
RATHER BEAUTIFUL FIVE DOLLAR BILLS.

232
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,531
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE DOLLAR FOR THEM.

233
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,036
HEY, REMEMBER HOW CHANDLER AND PHOEBE

234
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,538
BLEW US OFF YESTERDAY?

235
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,039
NO.

236
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,042
REMEMBER? YOU WERE EATING PIZZA.

237
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,043
YEAH.

238
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,545
OKAY.

239
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,547
WELL, APPARENTLY, CHANDLER'S ANGRY AT US

240
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,048
FOR NOT GETTING HIM A TICKET

241
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,050
TO THAT KNICKS GAME A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.

242
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,553
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO JUST GET HIM A TICKET?

243
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,555
THAT GUY IS ALWAYS MOOCHING OFF OF US.

244
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,056
RIGHT.

245
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,559
ANYWAY, I STILL THINK WE SHOULD TRY

246
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,060
TO PATCH THINGS UP.

247
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,562
YOU KNOW, LIKE, UH...

248
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,564
MAYBE WE CAN GET HIM TICKETS TO ANOTHER KNICKS GAME

249
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,565
AND INVITE HIM.

250
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,567
OH, WOW, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

251
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,069
AND I STILL HAVE HIS CREDIT CARD.

252
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,571
HERE YOU GO.

253
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,072
HEY, HEY, HEY. HOLD ON.

254
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,574
I GOT THIS ONE. HERE YOU GO.

255
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,075
YOU KNOW, I GOT TO TELL YOU.

256
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,077
SOMETIMES I DON'T GET CHANDLER.

257
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,579
YOU KNOW, ME AND HIM DO STUFF

258
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,080
ALL THE TIME WITHOUT YOU

259
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,582
AND YOU DON'T GET ALL UPSET.

260
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,586
ALL THE TIME?

261
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,087
ALL THE TIME.

262
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,590
I'M SORRY.

263
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,591
IT WAS REJECTED.

264
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,593
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

265
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,594
LET ME SEE THAT.

266
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,596
OH, THIS ONE'S MINE.

267
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,598
HERE YOU GO.

268
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,101
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!

269
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,102
STILL CRYING?

270
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,104
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL.

271
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,107
I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.

272
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,609
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

273
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,611
I WANTED HIM TO OPEN UP.

274
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,114
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT I WAS GOING TO UNLEASH

275
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:19,118
THIS WEEPY, CLINGY, MOIST MONSTER.

276
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,120
YOU KNOW, I ONLY KNOW OF TWO SUREFIRE WAYS

277
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,623
TO SHUT A MAN UP, AND ONE OF THEM IS SEX.

278
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,624
WHAT'S THE OTHER ONE?

279
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,125
I DON'T KNOW. I'VE NEVER HAD

280
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,126
TO USE THE OTHER ONE.

281
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,628
I'M JUST SAYING

282
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,631
YOU KNOW, IF WE'RE HAVING SEX, HE'S NOT GOING TO BE TALKING.

283
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,632
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

284
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,133
YOU'RE THE TALKER.

285
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,638
ANYWAY, UH, GREAT IDEA.

286
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,139
UM, I GOT TO GO TO THE STORE.

287
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,142
I TOLD HIM THAT I WOULD BUY HIM SOME MORE TISSUES.

288
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,143
OH, WE HAVE SOME HERE.

289
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,645
NO, YOU DON'T!

290
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:52,151
OKAY. UM, I'D ALSO LIKE TO TRY ON THE TIARA.

291
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,656
OH, YEAH. OKAY.

292
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,159
WOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

293
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,161
TOO MUCH?

294
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,164
A TAD.

295
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,667
THEN TAKE THE TIARA BACK

296
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,169
AND LET ME HOLD THE MUSKET AGAIN.

297
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,179
SOMETHING'S MISSING.

298
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,180
IT'S NOT...

299
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,182
OKAY. OH. LET ME SEE THE RING

300
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,684
THAT MY FRIEND PICKED OUT.

301
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,686
WHERE'S THE 1920s

302
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,187
PRINCESS CUT RING?

303
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,690
I JUST SOLD IT TO THAT GENTLEMAN.

304
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,691
OH, MY GOD!

305
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,693
WAIT! NO!

306
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,194

307
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,196
NO! WHAT?! HEY!

308
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,698
LET ME OUT!

309
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,199
NOW!

310
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,710

311
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,714
RACHEL?

312
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,215
NO.

313
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,217
HOW ARE YOU, PAUL?

314
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,719
OKAY.

315
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,725
CHANDLER...

316
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,728
DID YOUR DAD EVER HUG YOU?

317
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,229
NO.

318
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,230
DID HE HUG YOU?

319
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,733
NO.

320
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,734
NO, I...

321
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,737
IT'S JUST THAT... MY DAD NEVER DID.

322
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,740
I MISS MY DAD.

323
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,742
WELL, YOU CAN  SEE MY DAD IN VEGAS

324
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,243
KISSING OTHER DADS.

325
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,750
HEY, CHANDLER?

326
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,751
YEAH?

327
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,252
WOULD YOU...

328
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,759
WOULD YOU HUG ME?

329
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,762
I'M A LITTLE BUSY HERE, PAUL.

330
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,265
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT MY DAD USED TO SAY.

331
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,267
OKAY, A QUICK ONE.

332
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,268
COME ON, HUG IT OUT.

333
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,270
HEY!

334
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,773
THERE YOU GO.

335
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,775
OKAY.

336
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,276
FIVE MORE SECONDS.

337
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,778
OKAY!

338
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,779
HEY.

339
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,780
JOEY!

340
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,281
WHAT, HEY, WHAT, HEY, WHAT... HEY.

341
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,287
HI. PAUL, IS IT?

342
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,790
DO YOU HAVE MY CREDIT CARD?

343
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,793
YEAH, IT'S IN MY... IN... IN MY POCKET.

344
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:17,797
MY BACK POCKET!

345
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,298
THANK GOD.

346
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,300
HEY, LISTEN, I GOT US TICKETS

347
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,302
TO A KNICKS GAME TONIGHT

348
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,303
OH, I CAN'T GO.

349
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,305
COME ON. IT'LL BE FUN.

350
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,809
ME, YOU AND ROSS... AND PAUL, PROBABLY.

351
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,814
LOOK, I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS, OKAY?

352
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,316
I GOT TO GO.

353
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,318
WOW.

354
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,821
THAT WAS MEAN.

355
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,323
YEAH, I KNOW.

356
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,826
GET IN HERE.

357
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,327
YEAH.

358
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,832
 CHANDLER

359
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,834
I FOUND THE PERFECT RING.

360
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,335
OH, THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY NICE

361
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,337
BUT I'M GOING TO GO WITH THE ONE I PICKED FIRST.

362
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,338
OH, WAKE UP, CHANDLER.

363
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,840
THE ONE YOU PICKED IS GONE.

364
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,841
IT'S OVER!

365
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,342
WHAT?

366
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,343
SOME GUY BOUGHT IT.

367
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,845
I'M SORRY.

368
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,847
I TRIED TO STOP IT, BUT THEY PUT ME IN JAIL.

369
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,349
THEY PUT YOU IN JAIL?

370
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,352
THE LITTLE JAIL BETWEEN THE DOORS.

371
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,354
PHOEBE, I ASKED YOU TO GUARD THE RING.

372
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,856
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

373
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,858
BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS RING IS BETTER.

374
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,860
AND MONICA NEVER EVEN SAW THE OTHER RING.

375
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,863
YEAH, BUT WHEN HE PROPOSED TO ME WITH THE RING

376
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,364
PS. I GOT... GOOSE BUM

377
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,866
MAYBE IT WAS THE GUY.

378
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,868
IT WAS THE RING.

379
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,372
HEY, SO, UH, WAS HE EXCITED ABOUT THE TICKETS?

380
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,373
NO.

381
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,374
HE BLEW US OFF.

382
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,375
WHAT?

383
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,877
I KNOW!

384
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,879
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

385
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,381
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

386
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,884
I'M A LITTLE MAD AT HIM NOW.

387
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,386
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

388
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,891
ME, TOO.

389
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,393
YOU KNOW WHAT?

390
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,396
HE DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO US ABOUT BEING ANGRY.

391
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,398
WELL, MAYBE WE DON'T TALK TO HIM AT ALL.

392
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,400
OOH...

393
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,902
FREEZE HIM OUT.

394
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,402
THAT'S RIGHT.

395
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,403
I LIKE IT.

396
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,905
EH? WE'LL SHOW HIM.

397
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,406
FROM NOW ON, IT'S GOING TO BE JOEY AND ROSS--

398
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,908
BEST FRIENDS.

399
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,909
OKAY.

400
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,912
WE'RE GOING TO BE THE NEW JOEY AND CHANDLER.

401
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,415
WHAT?

402
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,917
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

403
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,418
YOU THINK YOU AND CHANDLER

404
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,920
WERE CLOSER THAN ME AND CHANDLER?

405
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,422
HEY, HEY, HEY. DON'T GET ANGRY.

406
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,925
WE TURN ON EACH OTHER, HE WINS.

407
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,933
HI. I'M BACK. HEY, I HAVE

408
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,934
SO MUCH MORE TO TELL YOU.

409
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,935
I'VE WRITTEN IT ALL DOWN.

410
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,436
AH, THAT'S GREAT.

411
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,440
NO, ACTUALLY, THAT'S...

412
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,442
THAT'S GREAT.

413
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,944
THAT'S REALLY GREAT.

414
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,946
YOU YOU KNOW, I GOT TO TELL

415
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,447
WRITING

416
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,949
GETS ME, UH...

417
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,451
GETS ME KIND OF HOT.

418
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,453
WAIT, WAIT, LISTEN.

419
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,955
LISTEN TO THIS.

420
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,457
YOU KNOW WHAT I WANTED TO BE WHEN I WAS THAT AGE?

421
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,960
A LOVER?

422
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,961
SURFER.

423
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,462
OH, YEAH? SURFER?

424
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,464
I WANTED TO BE ONE WITH THE WAVES, YOU KNOW...

425
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,466
OKAY, HONEY, HOLD ON REAL QUICK.

426
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,467
HOLD ON A SECOND.

427
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,468
LET ME JUST, UH...

428
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,470
GET A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE HERE.

429
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,472
OH, WAIT. NOW, WAIT A SECOND.

430
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,975
THIS ISN'T TOO REVEALING, IS IT?

431
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:20,479
NO. "WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT LITTLE DUDE...

432
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,481
SO FULL OF DREAMS?"

433
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,988
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE LITTLE DUDE!

434
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,491
I CAN'T... I CANNOT LISTEN TO ANY MORE OF THIS.

435
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,493
THE ONLY PERSON WHO WOULD WANT TO LISTEN

436
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,996
TO ANY MORE OF THIS IS A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL

437
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,999
AND THAT IS ONLY BECAUSE THEY GET PAID $100 AN HOUR.

438
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,001
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY I COULD HAVE MADE

439
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,502
LISTENING TO YOU? $2,000 DOLLARS.

440
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,504
AND YOU KNOW WHEN I FIGURED THAT OUT?

441
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,505
WHILE YOU WERE TALKING.

442
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,008
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE TRYING TO STIFLE ME

443
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,511
WHEN, JUST 14 HOURS AGO, WE FIGURED OUT THAT THAT IS EXACTLY

444
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,014
WHAT MY MOTHER WAS TRYING TO DO TO ME.

445
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,515
OH, I'M SORRY.

446
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,519
I... I... I DON'T MEAN... DIDN'T MEAN TO STIFLE YOU.

447
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,523
I... THIS IS ALL JUST A LITTLE OVERWHELMING.

448
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,025
OH, RACHEL.

449
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,026
I'M...

450
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,527
SO SORRY.

451
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,029
OH...

452
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,031
I DIDN'T MEAN TO OVERWHELM YOU.

453
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:16,035
IT'S JUST THAT... WHEN THOSE GATES OPENED

454
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:20,539
IT WAS HARD TO... HARD TO CLOSE THEM...

455
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,543
BUT THEY ARE CLOSED NOW, BELIEVE ME.

456
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,045
I'M SO GLAD.

457
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,547
I'M SO GLAD... YOU SHARED...

458
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,050
AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE DONE.

459
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,556
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY WE, UM...

460
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,558
I'D REALLY LIKE THAT.

461
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,060
MM HMM.

462
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,068

463
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,069

464
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,070

465
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,072
THAT WAS...

466
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,074
SO GOOD.

467
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,579

468
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,584
OH... OH...

469
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,585
YUCK!

470
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,588
HEY. I CAN'T BELIEVE

471
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,090
I LET YOU TALK ME INTO BUYING

472
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,592
THIS STUPID, GUMBALL MACHINE LOOKING RING.

473
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,095
IT'S NOT A STUPID, GUMBALL MACHINE- LOOKING RING.

474
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,596
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL RING.

475
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,597
NO, IT'S NOT.

476
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,099
WHEN I LOOKED AT THE OTHER RING

477
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,602
I COULD SEE MONICA'S FACE WHEN I GAVE IT TO HER, YOU KNOW?

478
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,604
AND I COULD SEE HER SAYING, "YES."

479
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,607
WHEN I LOOK AT THIS RING, ALL I SEE IS A RING...

480
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,609
UNLESS I LOOK AT IT REALLY CLOSELY

481
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,611
AND THEN... I CAN SEE MY OWN EYE.

482
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,614

483
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,117
LOOK, THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

484
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,618
I'M GOING TO DO IN MY LIFE.

485
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,120
I WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S PERFECT.

486
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,621
OKAY, THERE MAY BE A WAY

487
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,123
THAT WE COULD GET THE OTHER RING BACK

488
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,125
BECAUSE I HEARD THE GUY TELL THE JEWELER

489
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,626
WHERE HE WAS GOING TO PROPOSE.

490
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,129
SO, MAYBE WE COULD GET HIM TO TRADE RINGS OR SOMETHING.

491
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,131
WE CAN'T DO THAT.

492
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,633
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T GIVE HER

493
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,634
THAT STUPID GUMBALL RING.

494
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,636
ALL RIGHT, WHERE WAS HE GOING?

495
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,138
IT'S A RESTAURANT...

496
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,640
IT'S... RAINBOW SOMETHING.

497
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:02,641
RAINBOW ROOM? NOPE.

498
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,143
RAINBOW GRILL? NO.

499
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,145
SOMEWHERE OVER THE...?

500
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,647
L'ESPACE.

501
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,148
RAINBOW L'ESPACE.

502
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,649
NO, NO. JUST L'ESPACE.

503
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,652
I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW

504
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,654
HOW YOU GOT FROM RAINBOW TO L'ESPACE.

505
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,656
NO, YOU WOULDN'T.

506
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,159
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET IN HERE.

507
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,169
THERE HE IS.

508
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,171
 OKAY, AND HE HASN'T PROPOSED YET

509
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,173
BECAUSE SHE HAS NO RING ON HER FINGER.

510
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,174
OD. WOW, YOU'RE GO

511
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,176
AFTER THIS, WE SHOULD SOLVE CRIMES.

512
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,177
YEAH.

513
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,678
OKAY, GO GO GO GET HIM.

514
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,180
OH, OKAY.

515
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,184
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

516
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,685
COULD YOU COME WITH ME, PLEASE?

517
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,187
YOU HAVE A PHONE CALL.

518
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,188
WHO IS IT?

519
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,689
IT IS YOUR OFFICE.

520
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,191
DO YOU KNOW WHO AT MY OFFICE?

521
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,192
JOHN.

522
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,693
OH, JOHN. GREAT.

523
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,697
HERE HE IS.

524
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,199
HI, HI.

525
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,700
OKAY, THERE WAS A SLIGHT MIX UP

526
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,701
AT THE JEWELRY STORE.

527
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,703
THE RING YOU'RE ABOUT TO PROPOSE WITH

528
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,205
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HELD FOR ME.

529
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,207
SO, I'M GOING TO NEED TO HAVE THAT BACK...

530
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,209
BUT, IN EXCHANGE

531
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,710
I'M WILLING TO TRADE YOU

532
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,713
THIS BEAUTIFUL, MORE EXPENSIVE RING.

533
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,716
WOW.

534
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,218
I WOULD TRADE.

535
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,219
IT IS BEAUTIFUL

536
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,721
BUT I'M GOING TO USE THIS ONE.

537
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,223
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

538
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,724
NO, NO, SEE, THIS IS MY FIANCEE

539
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,726
AND HER HEART WAS SET ON THAT RING.

540
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,229
YOU DON'T WANT TO BREAK HER HEART, NOW, DO YOU?

541
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,232
YEAH, DO YOU WANT TO BREAK A DYING WOMAN'S HEART?

542
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,234
YOU'RE DYING?

543
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,737

544
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,739
YES, SHE'S DYING...

545
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,242
OF A COUGH, APPARENTLY.

546
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,244
 YES...

547
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,246
AND IT IS MY DYING WIS H TO HAVE THAT RING.

548
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,248
SEE, IF I'M NOT BURIED WITH THAT RING

549
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,750
THEN MY SPIRIT IS GOING TO WANDER THE NETHERWORLD

550
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,751
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

551
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,253
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH, HONEY.

552
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,256
UH... I DON'T KNOW.

553
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,759
LET ME SEE THE RING.

554
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,761
GREAT. OKAY, HERE.

555
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,264
ALL RIGHT. I'LL DO IT.

556
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,766
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

557
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,769
AND YOU ARE ABOUT TO MARRY A WONDERFUL MAN.

558
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,777
HEY, I'M MARRYING A DEAD WOMAN.
