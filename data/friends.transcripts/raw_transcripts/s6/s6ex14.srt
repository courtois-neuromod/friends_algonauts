00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:06,079
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

601
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:09,082
ROSS IS ON A DATE WITH MY SISTER

602
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:12,585
AND THEY SHUT THE DRAPES TWO AND A HALF HOURS AGO.

603
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:15,588
WHOA. I DIDN'T KNOW WE COULD DATE YOUR SISTER.

604
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:21,094
JOEY, WE KNOW YOU STEAL OUR FOOD.

00:24:22,095 --> 00:24:24,097

00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:26,099
OH, ARE THE DRAPES STILL CLOSED, HONEY?

607
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:28,101

00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:30,603

I CAN'T BELIEVE ROSS IS GOING OUT

00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,611
WITH RACHEL'S SISTER.

614
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:40,613
WHEN CHANDLER MADE OUT WITH MY SISTER

615
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:42,115
I WAS MAD AT HIM FOR TEN YEARS.

616
00:24:42,115 --> 00:24:43,616
THAT WAS, LIKE, FIVE YEARS AGO.

617
00:24:44,117 --> 00:24:45,618
YEAH, YOU GOT FIVE YEARS LEFT.

618
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,120

I SHUT THE DRAPES TO SHOW HER SLIDES

645
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:06,199

646
00:26:08,201 --> 00:26:11,704

00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:14,207

SHE REALLY DUG MY SLIDES

650
00:26:20,213 --> 00:26:23,216
AND SHE WAS DEFINITELY GIVING ME THE VIBE.

651
00:26:23,216 --> 00:26:26,219
WAS IT THE "PLEASE DON'T SHOW ME ANOTHER PICTURE

652
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:27,720
OF A TRILOBITE" VIBE?

653
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,724
I'M TELLING YOU, SHE WAS INTO ME, OKAY?

654
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:34,727
HEY, YOU REMEMBERED TRILOBITE.

656
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:39,232
IF SHE WASN'T INTO ME

657
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,234
WHY WHY WOULD SHE ASK ME OUT AGAIN?

658
00:26:41,234 --> 00:26:42,735

00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:44,737

THE MOST ROMANTIC DAY OF THE YEAR.

664
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:51,744
WHO KNOWS WHAT COULD HAPPEN.

665
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:54,247
I MIGHT NOT BE SHUTTING MY DRAPES TO SHOW HER

699
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:07,320
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS ARE SO SAD ABOUT.

700
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,821
IT ALL WORKS OUT.

701
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:11,324
E.T. STAYS WITH ELLIOT, AND THEY GET TO HANG OUT

702
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:13,826

703
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:16,329
JOEY, YOU'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE.

704
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:17,830
E.T. GOES BACK HOME.

705
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,332
WHAT?

706
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:24,837
OH, NO. I FORGOT.

707
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:30,843
YOU KNOW WHAT'S SADDER THAN THIS? BAMBI.

708
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,845
I CRIED FOR THREE DAYS WITH THAT MOVIE.

709
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:34,347
NO, WAIT-- TWO.

710
00:28:34,347 --> 00:28:36,349
BECAUSE ON THE THIRD DAY, MY MOTHER KILLED HERSELF

711
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:37,850
SO I WAS PARTLY CRYING FOR THAT.

712
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:42,355
WELL, SEE, NOW, THAT I CAN SEE CRYING OVER

713
00:28:42,355 --> 00:28:44,357
BUT BAMBI IS A CARTOON.

714
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:46,359
YOU DIDN'T CRY WHEN BAMBI'S MOTHER DIED?

715
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,860
YES, IT WAS VERY SAD

716
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,863
WHEN THE GUY STOPPED DRAWING THE DEER.

717
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:54,367
LOOK, IF THIS MOVIE IS MAKING YOU GUYS CRY SO MUCH

718
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:55,868
LET'S JUST CHANGE THE CHANNEL.

719
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:56,869
OKAY.

720
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:57,870
OKAY. THERE.

721
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:04,377
JOEY, YOU'RE CRYING OVER A DORITOS COMMERCIAL.

722
00:29:04,377 --> 00:29:07,380
I WAS UP FOR THAT PART.

723
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:11,884
CHANDLER, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH CRYING.

724
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:13,886
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SO MACHO ALL THE TIME.

725
00:29:14,387 --> 00:29:15,888
I'M NOT MACHO.

726
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:18,391
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

727
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:20,393
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING.

728
00:29:20,393 --> 00:29:22,895
NO, I GUESS I JUST NEVER REALLY CRIED, YOU KNOW?

729
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:24,397
I'M NOT A CRYING KIND OF GUY.

730
00:29:24,397 --> 00:29:25,898
COME ON, MAN.

731
00:29:25,898 --> 00:29:28,401
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING THAT GETS YOU CHOKED UP.

732
00:29:28,401 --> 00:29:29,902
LIKE, UH...

733
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:32,405
UH, WHAT IF YOU SAW A THREE LEGGED PUPPY.

00:29:32,405 --> 00:29:35,908
I'D BE SAD, SURE...

735
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:37,910
BUT I WOULDN'T CRY.

736
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:43,416
WELL, WHAT IF THE PUPPY SAID, "HELP ME, CHANDLER.

737
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:46,919
ALL THE OTHER PUPPIES PICK ON ME."

738
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,422
CRY? I JUST FOUND A TALKING PUPPY.

739
00:29:49,422 --> 00:29:50,923
I'M RICH.

740
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:54,427
WAIT. I'VE GOT IT.

741
00:29:54,427 --> 00:29:55,928
I HAVE GOT IT.

742
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:57,930
PICTURES FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD.

743
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,433
THIS WILL GET YOU GOING GOOD.

744
00:30:00,433 --> 00:30:02,435
ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?

745
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:04,937
AH, THAT'S PARENTS' DAY, FIRST GRADE.

746
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:08,941
THAT'S ME WITH THE JANITOR, MARTIN.

747
00:30:09,442 --> 00:30:10,443
WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS?

748
00:30:10,443 --> 00:30:11,944
OH, THEY DIDN'T WANT TO COME.

749
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:13,446
OH, CHANDLER.

750
00:30:13,446 --> 00:30:14,447
POOR THING.

751
00:30:14,447 --> 00:30:16,949
SO, THAT STORY DOESN'T MAKE YOU CRY?

752
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:17,950
NO. LOOK, I DON'T CRY.

753
00:30:18,451 --> 00:30:19,952
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL, OKAY?

754
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:22,455
NO! IT'S NOT OKAY!

755
00:30:22,455 --> 00:30:24,457
IT'S NOT OKAY AT ALL.

756
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:26,959

OH, YOU'RE PHOEBE'S FAN.

782
00:31:22,515 --> 00:31:23,516
OH, YEAH.

783
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:26,519
I'VE SEEN ALL HER MOVIES.

784
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:27,520
MOVIES?

785
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,023
THAT WAS PHOEBE BUFFAY THE PORN STAR.

786
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:36,529

787
00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:38,030
I DON'T THINK SO.

788
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,031
NO, NO, IT WAS.

789
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:42,535
 SHE WAS IN SEX TOY STORY II.

790
00:31:42,535 --> 00:31:44,537
LAWRENCE OF ALABIA.

791
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:48,040
AND I GOT HER AUTOGRAPH.

792
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,542
THE GUYS AT THE COMIC BOOK STORE

793
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:51,544
AREN'T GOING TO BELIEVE THIS.

794
00:31:54,547 --> 00:31:55,548
GUNTHER.

795
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:58,050
HEY, DON'T LET THAT GUY IN HERE ANYMORE.

796
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,052
HE JUST SAID PHOEBE'S A PORN STAR.

797
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:03,055
WELL, I WOULDN'T CALL HER A STAR

798
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:05,057
BUT SHE'S REALLY GOOD.

799
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:08,060
YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT INSPECT HER GADGET.

800
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:13,065
HEY.

801
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:14,567
HEY.

802
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:16,068
YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

803
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:17,570
ROSS JUST TOTALLY BLEW ME OFF

804
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,071
AND HE DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME WHY.

805
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:21,073
AH, WELL.

806
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:22,074
YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?

807
00:32:22,575 --> 00:32:24,577
THE BEST THING TO DO TO GET OVER A GUY

808
00:32:24,577 --> 00:32:26,579
IS TO START DATING SOMEONE ELSE.

809
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:28,581
OH! OH, THERE IS THIS GREAT GUY

810
00:32:28,581 --> 00:32:30,583
YOU WILL JUST LOVE AT WORK NAMED BOB.

811
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,586
HE'S A REAL UP AND COMER IN HUMAN RESOURCES.

812
00:32:33,586 --> 00:32:35,087
MAYBE I TALK TOO MUCH.

813
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:38,591
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE, YOU KNOW, AGGRESSIVE SEXUALLY.

814
00:32:38,591 --> 00:32:40,092
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

815
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:42,094
NO, NO, NO, NO.

816
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:44,096
THAT WOULD NEVER HAVE WORKED ON ROSS.

817
00:32:44,096 --> 00:32:46,098
BUT YOU KNOW WHO THAT MIGHT WORK ON?

818
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:47,600
BOB IN HUMAN RESOURCES.

819
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,602
YOU KNOW, THANKS FOR TRYING TO CHEER ME UP

820
00:32:49,602 --> 00:32:50,603
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO DATE

821
00:32:50,603 --> 00:32:52,104
SOME RANDOM GUY FROM YOUR WORK.

822
00:32:52,104 --> 00:32:54,607
NOT RANDOM. BOB.

823
00:32:54,607 --> 00:32:57,610
IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE I'M NOT MATURE ENOUGH.

824
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,111
OR SMART ENOUGH.

825
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:01,614
MAYBE HE DOESN'T LIKE THE WAY I DRESS.

826
00:33:01,614 --> 00:33:03,616
NO, THAT CAN'T BE IT.

827
00:33:03,616 --> 00:33:05,618
IT'S REALLY GOT TO BE THE SMART THING.

828
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:07,620
OH, I'M SO STUPID.

829
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,123
I'M JUST THIS, LIKE, INCREDIBLY PRETTY, STUPID GIRL.

830
00:33:11,624 --> 00:33:13,626
NO, HONEY...

831
00:33:13,626 --> 00:33:17,129
OKAY. OKAY. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW

832
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:20,132
WHY ROSS CANCELED THE DATE?

833
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:21,634
BECAUSE I ASKED HIM TO.

834
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:23,135
YOU ASKED HIM TO?

835
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:24,136
MM HMM.

836
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:25,137
WHY?

837
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:26,138
BECAUSE YOU ARE MY SISTER

838
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:28,641
AND ROSS AND I HAVE THIS HUGE HISTORY...

839
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:29,642
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

840
00:33:29,642 --> 00:33:30,643
YOU WANT TO GO OUT.

841
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:32,144
WITH ROSS?

842
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:33,145
NO.

843
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:34,146
YOU DON'T WANT HIM, BUT YOU

844
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:35,147
DON'T WANT ME TO HAVE HIM?

845
00:33:35,648 --> 00:33:39,151
YOU KNOW BOB IN HUMAN RESOURCES?

846
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:41,153
OH! I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU DID THIS TO ME!

847
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:42,655
YOU HAD ME DOUBTING HOW SMART I WAS...

848
00:33:42,655 --> 00:33:44,156

849
00:33:44,156 --> 00:33:46,158
YOU HAD ME DOUBTING MY FASHION SENSE.

850
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:47,660
IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

851
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,161
YOU JUST DON'T DATE ROSS.

852
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:50,663
THERE'S A MILLION OTHER GUYS OUT THERE.

853
00:33:50,663 --> 00:33:53,165
HEY, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

854
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:55,167
I'M NOT TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO.

855
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:57,169
I AM TELLING YOU WHAT NOT TO DO.

856
00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:00,172
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS SO JEALOUS OF ME?

857
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:02,675
OH, JILL, THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME BEING JEALOUS OF YOU.

858
00:34:02,675 --> 00:34:04,176
THIS IS ABOUT YOU BEING A BRAT--

859
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:05,678
WANTING WHAT YOU CAN'T HAVE.

860
00:34:05,678 --> 00:34:07,179
"CAN'T HAVE"?

861
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:10,683
EXCUSE ME. THE ONLY THING I CAN'T HAVE IS DAIRY!

862
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:13,185
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

863
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:15,187
WELL, YOU JUST BLEW YOUR CHANCES AT DATING BOB.

864
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:16,689
WHO?

865
00:34:16,689 --> 00:34:18,190
IN HUMAN RESOURCES!

866
00:34:20,693 --> 00:34:22,194
I AM JEALOUS OF HER?!

867
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:24,196
I MEAN, WHO DOES SHE THINK SHE IS-- PRINCESS CAROLINE?

868
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:27,199
YOU'RE JEALOUS OF PRINCESS CAROLINE?

869
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,702
DO I HAVE MY OWN CASTLE?

870
00:34:30,703 --> 00:34:32,204
HEY. HEY.

871
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:34,206
UH, PHOEBE'S NOT HERE, IS SHE?

872
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:35,708
NO.

873
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:38,711
 OH, GREAT. DID YOU GET A MOVIE?

874
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:45,217
UH... YEAH, YEAH.

875
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:47,219
BUT, UH... I DON'T THINK IT'S THE KIND

876
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,721
YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE.

877
00:34:48,721 --> 00:34:50,222
YOU DIDN'T GET MORE MOVIES

878
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:52,224
THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE US REACHING

879
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:54,226
FOR THE TISSUES ALL NIGHT, DID YOU?

880
00:34:59,732 --> 00:35:01,734
SORT OF.

881
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:04,236
GUYS, WHAT'S GOING ON?

882
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,739
UH...

883
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:08,741
PHOEBE'S A PORN STAR!

884
00:35:08,741 --> 00:35:09,742
WHAT? WHAT?

885
00:35:09,742 --> 00:35:10,743
 YEAH!

886
00:35:10,743 --> 00:35:11,744
COME HERE.

887
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,245
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

888
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:17,750
"PHOEBE BUFFAY IN BUFFAY THE VAMPIRE LAYER."

889
00:35:19,752 --> 00:35:20,753
MY GOD!

890
00:35:20,753 --> 00:35:22,254
THAT'S PHOEBE. WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

891
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:24,757
WELL, DOWN AT THE ADULT VIDEO PLACE ON BLEEKER.

892
00:35:24,757 --> 00:35:27,259
AND I SAW JOEY WAS ABOUT TO GO IN

893
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,261
SO I RAN IN AHEAD OF HIM

894
00:35:29,762 --> 00:35:32,765
TO TO SURPRISE HIM AND... AND THEN...

895
00:35:32,765 --> 00:35:33,766

896
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:35,267
THEN I PRETENDED

897
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:38,771
THAT I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS IN THERE.

898
00:35:40,773 --> 00:35:44,276
WOW. I MEAN, I JUST... I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

899
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:46,278
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, YOU THINK YOU KNOW SOMEONE...

900
00:35:46,779 --> 00:35:48,781
EVEN PHOEBE, WHO'S ALWAYS BEEN SOMEWHAT OF A QUESTION MARK.

901
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:49,782
MMM.

902
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:53,285
THIS IS SO BIZARRE.

903
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:54,787
I GUESS IT KIND OF MAKES SENSE, THOUGH.

904
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:57,289
YOU KNOW, SHE HAD SUCH A TERRIBLE CHILDHOOD.

905
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:59,792
I HAD A TERRIBLE CHILDHOOD, AND I DON'T DO PORN.

906
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:01,794
YES, BUT YOU'RE DEAD INSIDE.

907
00:36:01,794 --> 00:36:02,795
OH, YEAH.

908
00:36:02,795 --> 00:36:05,798
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I BETTER TAKE THAT BACK.

909
00:36:05,798 --> 00:36:06,799
WH WHY?

910
00:36:06,799 --> 00:36:07,800
WE CAN'T WATCH THAT.

911
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,301
I MEAN, THAT'S PHOEBE.

912
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:10,302
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

913
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:12,304
WE CAN'T. WE SHOULDN'T WATCH THIS.

914
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:14,306
ABSOLUTELY NOT. THAT GOES BACK.

915
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:16,308
YOU KNOW, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT.

916
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:17,309
JUST THE FIRST HALF?

917
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:19,812
NO... HEY, NO, THIS IS WRONG, YOU GUYS!

918
00:36:19,812 --> 00:36:20,813
PHOEBE'S OUR FRIEND.

919
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:22,314
I'M NOT GOING TO WATCH IT.

920
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:23,816
YEAH!

921
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:25,818
GOOD FOR YOU, JOE.

922
00:36:39,832 --> 00:36:41,834
Ah, I thought I'd find you here...

923
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:43,335
Nosferatool.

924
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:48,340
Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?

925
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:50,342
Actually, I was kind of hoping

926
00:36:50,843 --> 00:36:52,845
it would be the other way around.

927
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:56,348
 HOLD ON A SECOND.

928
00:36:56,849 --> 00:36:58,350
WHAT IS THAT ON HER ANKLE?

929
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,352
HER ANKLE IS WHAT YOU'RE WATCHING?

930
00:37:00,853 --> 00:37:04,857
WELL, IT'S HARD TO TELL...

931
00:37:04,857 --> 00:37:06,859
OH, GOD, IF SHE WOULD JUST STOP MOVING.

932
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,862
SHE'S JUST DOING HER JOB.

933
00:37:09,862 --> 00:37:13,365
YOU SICK BASTARDS.

934
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:15,367
OH, IT'S A TATTOO.

935
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:16,368
THAT'S WEIRD.

936
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:18,370
PHOEBE DOESN'T...

937
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,371
WAIT. THAT'S URSULA!

938
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:20,372
THAT'S NOT PHOEBE.

939
00:37:20,873 --> 00:37:21,874
THAT IS URSULA!

940
00:37:21,874 --> 00:37:23,375
WAIT! WAIT!

941
00:37:23,876 --> 00:37:24,877
THEN I CAN WATCH THAT.

942
00:37:24,877 --> 00:37:25,878
REWIND IT! REWIND IT!

943
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:27,880
HEY.

944
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,381
WHAT'S UP?

945
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:30,382
OH, MY GOD!

946
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:31,383
WHAT AM I DOING?!

947
00:37:43,896 --> 00:37:45,397
HEY, SWEETIE.

948
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:46,899
HEY.

949
00:37:49,902 --> 00:37:53,405
CHICKEN SOUP FOR THE SOUL?

950
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:56,408
THERE'S NO BACK TO THIS COUCH.

951
00:37:56,408 --> 00:37:57,910
WHY ARE YOU READING THIS?

952
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,411
YOU HATE THIS KIND OF STUFF.

953
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:00,412
YEAH, I KNOW.

954
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:02,414
BUT I FIGURED I'D GIVE IT A SHOT.

955
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:04,416
MAYBE ONE OF THOSE STORIES WOULD MAKE ME CRY

956
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:05,918
AND THEN YOU WOULDN'T THINK I WAS

957
00:38:05,918 --> 00:38:07,419
YOU KNOW, ALL DEAD INSIDE.

958
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:08,420
AW, THAT'S SO SWEET.

959
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:11,423
BUT, CHANDLER, I DON'T CARE IF YOU CAN'T CRY.

960
00:38:11,423 --> 00:38:12,424
I LOVE YOU.

961
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:14,927
AW, THAT MAKES ME FEEL SO WARM

962
00:38:14,927 --> 00:38:16,929
IN MY HOLLOW TIN CHEST.

963
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:19,932
STOP IT. NO, I MEAN, COME ON, SERIOUSLY, THINK ABOUT IT.

964
00:38:19,932 --> 00:38:21,433
WE GET MARRIED--

965
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:23,936
I'M UP AT THE ALTAR, AND I'M LIKE THIS...

966
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:26,939
I WON'T CARE...

967
00:38:26,939 --> 00:38:29,441
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU'LL BE FEELING IT

968
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:30,442
ALL IN HERE.

969
00:38:30,943 --> 00:38:31,443
YEAH?

970
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:32,945
YEAH.

971
00:38:32,945 --> 00:38:34,446
AND IF WE HAVE A BABY ONE DAY

972
00:38:34,947 --> 00:38:36,949
AND THE DOCTOR HANDS IT TO YOU

973
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:37,950
IN THE DELIVERY ROOM

974
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,451
AND YOU DON'T CRY...

975
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:40,953
SO WHAT?

976
00:38:40,953 --> 00:38:43,956
AND IF WE TAKE HIM TO COLLEGE

977
00:38:43,956 --> 00:38:44,957
AND WE COME HOME

978
00:38:44,957 --> 00:38:48,460
AND WE SEE HIS EMPTY ROOM FOR THE FIRST TIME

979
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,962
AND YOU GOT NOTHING...

980
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:52,965
WON'T MATTER TO ME.

981
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:56,969
OKAY.

982
00:38:56,969 --> 00:39:00,472
WELL, I WON'T WORRY ABOUT THIS ANYMORE THEN.

983
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:02,474
YEAH, AND IF I DIE...

984
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:06,979
FROM A LONG ILLNESS

985
00:39:06,979 --> 00:39:09,481
AND YOU'RE WRITING OUT MY EULOGY

986
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:13,485
AND YOU OPEN THE DESK DRAWER AND YOU FIND A NOTE FROM ME

987
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:16,488
THAT SAYS, "I WILL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU"

988
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:20,993
AND YOU STILL CAN'T SHED ONE TINY TEAR...

989
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:23,996
I KNOW YOU'LL BE CRYING A RIVER INSIDE.

990
00:39:24,496 --> 00:39:26,498
OH, I LOVE YOU SO...

991
00:39:26,999 --> 00:39:28,000
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!

992
00:39:30,002 --> 00:39:31,003
WHAT?

993
00:39:31,003 --> 00:39:34,006
YOU CAN'T SHED A TEAR FOR YOUR DEAD WIFE?!

994
00:39:34,006 --> 00:39:36,508
I LEFT YOU A NOTE FROM THE BEYOND.

995
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:38,010
SO YOU DIDN'T MEAN ANY OF THAT?

996
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,511
NO, YOU ROBOT!

997
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:44,516

998
00:39:45,017 --> 00:39:46,018
YOU DAMN KIDS.

999
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:50,022
YOU RING MY BELL ONE MORE TIME, I SWEAR TO...

1000
00:39:50,022 --> 00:39:52,024
OH, JILL.

1001
00:39:52,024 --> 00:39:54,026
UM, THAT'S JUST A LITTLE GAME

1002
00:39:54,026 --> 00:39:56,528
I PLAY WITH THE KIDS DOWN THE HALL.

1003
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:57,529
UM...

1004
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,032
THEY'VE REALLY TAKEN A LIKING TO ME.

1005
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:03,535
UH, WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1006
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:05,537
RACHEL AND I HAD A REALLY BIG FIGHT.

1007
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:07,039
CAN I COME IN?

1008
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:09,041
I KNOW WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO SEE EACH OTHER ANYMORE

1009
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:10,542
AND I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

1010
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,044
IT'S JUST THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY IN THE CITY

1011
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,046
AND I REALLY NEED SOMEBODY TO TALK TO ABOUT IT.

1012
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,048
OF COURSE. WHAT HAPPENED?

1013
00:40:16,048 --> 00:40:17,549
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

1014
00:40:21,053 --> 00:40:22,554
OKAY, UM...

1015
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:26,058
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT REALLY CHEER ME UP?

1016
00:40:26,058 --> 00:40:27,059
WHAT?

1017
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:28,060
SEEING SOME MORE

1018
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,062
OF YOUR SUPER COOL SLIDES.

1019
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:32,564
WOW. REALLY?

1020
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:33,565
TOTALLY. I LOVED THEM.

1021
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:35,567
AND MAYBE YOU COULD FINISH TELLING ME

1022
00:40:36,068 --> 00:40:38,070
ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF SAND.

1023
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:41,073
WELL, I'D LOVE TO.

1024
00:40:41,073 --> 00:40:42,574
YOU WAIT RIGHT HERE.

1025
00:40:42,574 --> 00:40:44,576
I'LL GO GET THE PROJECTOR AND MY NOTES.

1026
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:47,079
OH, GREAT. THANKS, ROSS. YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD FRIEND.

1027
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:48,580
OH...

1028
00:40:53,085 --> 00:40:54,586
HEY, HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN JILL?

1029
00:40:55,087 --> 00:40:56,588
I CAN'T FIND HER ANYWHERE.

1030
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:57,589
NO, I HAVEN'T.

1031
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:59,091
WELL, IS ROSS HOME?

1032
00:40:59,091 --> 00:41:01,093
MAYBE I'LL CALL HIM AND SEE IF HE'S SEEN...

1033
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:03,095

1034
00:41:09,101 --> 00:41:11,103
 WHO IS IT?

1035
00:41:11,103 --> 00:41:13,105
IT'S PHOEBE...

1036
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:15,107
PHOEBE.

1037
00:41:16,108 --> 00:41:17,109
HEY.

1038
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:18,610
OH, GOD.

1039
00:41:21,613 --> 00:41:23,115
SO SO YOU'RE MAKING PORN MOVIES.

1040
00:41:23,115 --> 00:41:24,616
NO, I'M NOT.

1041
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:27,119
 WE'RE STILL ROLLING.

1042
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:29,621
YOU'RE MAKING ONE RIGHT NOW.

1043
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:31,623
LET'S GO, PHOEBE.

1044
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:33,625
AND YOU'RE USING MY NAME.

1045
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,627
YEAH. CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?

1046
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:38,130
PHOEBE, COME ON.

1047
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,132
LOOK, I'M TALKING RIGHT NOW.

1048
00:41:40,132 --> 00:41:41,633
YOU MEAN HER.

1049
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:43,135
YOU KNOW...

1050
00:41:43,135 --> 00:41:45,637
TWIN STUFF IS ALWAYS A REAL BIG SELLER.

1051
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:47,639
WHAT?

1052
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:50,642
YEAH. I COULD TALK THEM INTO GIVING YOU, LIKE...

1053
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:52,144
$30 DOLLARS.

1054
00:41:54,146 --> 00:41:56,648
NO. NO WAY. NO.

1055
00:41:57,149 --> 00:41:58,150
AND STOP USING MY NAME.

1056
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,152
AND SHAME ON YOU.

1057
00:42:00,152 --> 00:42:01,653
AND SHAME ON ALL OF YOU!

1058
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:03,155
YOU'RE DISGUSTING...

1059
00:42:03,155 --> 00:42:05,157
ESPECIALLY YOU WITH... THAT.

1060
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,662
SLIDES ARE ALMOST READY.

1061
00:42:10,662 --> 00:42:13,165
YEAH.

1062
00:42:13,165 --> 00:42:15,167
OOH, I KNOW WHAT THIS IS MISSING.

1063
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,169
ALCOHOL.

1064
00:42:17,169 --> 00:42:20,672
UH, OKAY, WELL, THERE'S WINE IN THE KITCHEN.

1065
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:22,174
OH, GREAT.

1066
00:42:22,174 --> 00:42:24,676

1067
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:27,179
HELLO.

1068
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:29,681
WHAT IS MY SISTER DOING THERE

1069
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:31,683
AND WHY ARE THE DRAPES SHUT?

1070
00:42:33,185 --> 00:42:35,687
OKAY, RACH, CALM DOWN, OKAY?

1071
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:37,689
SHE'S... SHE'S REALLY UPSET.

1072
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:39,191
WE'RE JUST TALKING.

1073
00:42:39,191 --> 00:42:41,193
I THINK SHE'S TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN WITH YOU

1074
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:42,694
TO GET BACK AT ME.

1075
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:44,696
OH, SO THAT'S THE ONLY REASON

1076
00:42:44,696 --> 00:42:46,198
SHE COULD BE HERE, HUH?

1077
00:42:46,198 --> 00:42:48,700
IT COULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT

1078
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,702
THAT MAYBE I'M A GOOD LISTENER

1079
00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:52,704
AND I PUT ON A GREAT SLIDE SHOW.

1080
00:42:55,207 --> 00:42:57,209
ROSS, I AM TELLING YOU

1081
00:42:57,209 --> 00:43:00,212
SHE IS USING YOU TO GET BACK AT ME.

1082
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:01,713
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1083
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:03,215
I THINK I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

1084
00:43:03,215 --> 00:43:04,716
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. GOOD BYE.

1085
00:43:06,218 --> 00:43:08,220
WHOA.

1086
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:12,224
UH, THAT WAS YOUR SISTER, ACTUALLY.

1087
00:43:12,224 --> 00:43:15,727
SHE... SHE THINKS YOU'RE JUST USING ME.

1088
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:17,229
SO?

1089
00:43:23,235 --> 00:43:24,236
HEY.

1090
00:43:24,236 --> 00:43:25,737
HEY.

1091
00:43:25,737 --> 00:43:28,740
SO, I JUST CAME FROM THE COMPANY URSULA WORKS FOR.

1092
00:43:29,241 --> 00:43:32,244
OH, NO. NOT YOU, TOO?

1093
00:43:32,244 --> 00:43:34,746
NO. I JUST WENT TO PICK UP PHOEBE BUFFAY'S CHECKS.

1094
00:43:35,247 --> 00:43:36,248
THERE WERE A LOT OF THEM.

1095
00:43:36,248 --> 00:43:37,749
NICE.

1096
00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:38,750
MM HMM.

1097
00:43:39,251 --> 00:43:42,254
AND I WON'T HAVE TO GO BACK THERE ANYMORE

1098
00:43:42,254 --> 00:43:45,257
BECAUSE I GAVE THEM MY "CORRECT ADDRESS."

1099
00:43:45,257 --> 00:43:48,260
THAT'S GREAT, BUT ISN'T IT GOING TO BOTHER YOU

1100
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,762
THAT PEOPLE STILL THINK YOU'RE A PORN STAR?

1101
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:51,763
OH, NO, NO.

1102
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:53,265
I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT.

1103
00:43:53,265 --> 00:43:55,267
WELL, GOOD. YEAH.

1104
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:59,271
YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU KNOW ME FROM?

1105
00:43:59,271 --> 00:44:01,273
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT-- FROM PORN!

1106
00:44:01,273 --> 00:44:02,774
OKAY?

1107
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:07,779
YEAH, YOUR PERVERT BOYFRIEND WATCHED ME IN A PORNO MOVIE!

1108
00:44:10,282 --> 00:44:11,283
SEE?

1109
00:44:11,783 --> 00:44:12,784
YEAH.

1110
00:44:16,288 --> 00:44:17,789
HEY.

1111
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:20,292
YOU, UH, YOU MAY HAVE BEEN RIGHT ABOUT JILL.

1112
00:44:20,292 --> 00:44:21,293
OH, I KNEW IT.

1113
00:44:21,293 --> 00:44:22,294
WHAT HAPPENED?

1114
00:44:22,294 --> 00:44:24,296
UM, SHE KISSED ME.

1115
00:44:24,796 --> 00:44:25,297
WHAT?!

1116
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:26,798
YOU KISSED?

1117
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:28,800
MAYBE WE SHOULD GIVE THEM SOME PRIVACY.

1118
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,302
SHH!

1119
00:44:30,302 --> 00:44:32,304
LOOK, I, UH...

1120
00:44:32,304 --> 00:44:34,306
I TRIED NOT TO KISS HER, OKAY?

1121
00:44:34,306 --> 00:44:35,807
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT.

1122
00:44:35,807 --> 00:44:38,310
I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY EASY NOT TO KISS SOMEONE.

1123
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:39,311
YOU JUST DON'T KISS THEM.

1124
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:41,813
SEE, LOOK AT US RIGHT NOW-- NOT KISSING.

1125
00:44:41,813 --> 00:44:44,316
LET ME FINISH, OKAY?

1126
00:44:44,316 --> 00:44:47,319
SHE STARTED KISSING ME, AND I...

1127
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:48,820
DIDN'T STOP IT.

1128
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,322
I GUESS I JUST WASN'T THINKING.

1129
00:44:50,322 --> 00:44:52,324
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, YOU WEREN'T THINKING.

1130
00:44:52,824 --> 00:44:54,826
I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.

1131
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:55,827
HOLD ON. JUST...

1132
00:44:55,827 --> 00:44:57,329
BUT THEN I STARTED THINKING

1133
00:44:57,829 --> 00:44:59,331
AND I STOPPED THE KISSING.

1134
00:44:59,331 --> 00:45:01,333
OH, WELL, THANK YOU FOR TAKING YOUR TONGUE

1135
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:04,336
OUT OF MY SISTER'S MOUTH LONG ENOUGH TO TELL ME THAT.

1136
00:45:07,339 --> 00:45:09,341
LOOK, I REALIZED THAT, IF ANYTHING

1137
00:45:09,341 --> 00:45:11,343
WERE TO HAPPEN WITH ME AND JILL

1138
00:45:11,343 --> 00:45:14,346
THEN NOTHING COULD EVER HAPPEN WITH US.

1139
00:45:14,346 --> 00:45:16,348
WHAT?

1140
00:45:16,348 --> 00:45:17,849
NO, I MEAN...

1141
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:19,351
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW IF ANYTHING

1142
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:21,353
IS EVER GOING TO HAPPEN WITH US...

1143
00:45:21,353 --> 00:45:24,356
AGAIN EVER.

1144
00:45:24,356 --> 00:45:26,858
BUT I DON'T WANT TO KNOW THAT IT NEVER COULD.

1145
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:28,860
SO I STOPPED IT.

1146
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,363
AND...

1147
00:45:31,363 --> 00:45:34,366
SHE GOT MAD AND BROKE MY PROJECTOR.

1148
00:45:40,372 --> 00:45:41,873
WOW.

1149
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:46,878
I I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

1150
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:52,384
THANK YOU.

1151
00:45:54,886 --> 00:45:56,388
YOU'RE WELCOME.

1152
00:45:57,389 --> 00:46:01,393

1153
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:05,397
MY GOD. ARE YOU CRYING?

1154
00:46:05,397 --> 00:46:08,900
I JUST DON'T SEE WHY THOSE TWO CAN'T WORK THINGS OUT.

1155
00:46:13,638 --> 00:46:16,040
ALL RIGHT, I'M LEAVING.

1156
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,542
BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND ONE MORE DAY

1157
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:20,044
WITH SOMEONE WHO'S OUT TO SABOTAGE MY EVERY MOVE.

1158
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:20,912
THAT'S YOU, RACHEL.

1159
00:46:20,912 --> 00:46:23,415
YEAH, I GOT THAT.

1160
00:46:23,415 --> 00:46:24,416
AND YOU...

1161
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:25,917
I THROW MYSELF AT YOU

1162
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:26,918
AND YOU SAY NO?

1163
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:28,420
HOW GAY ARE YOU?

1164
00:46:32,924 --> 00:46:35,927
YOU TAKE CARE, JILL.

1165
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:36,928
OKAY, I'M LEAVING.

1166
00:46:37,429 --> 00:46:38,430
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

1167
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:39,931
I'LL MAKE IT ON MY OWN.

1168
00:46:40,432 --> 00:46:41,933
WHO KNOWS HOW I'LL GET BY

1169
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:43,435
OR EVEN IF I'LL SURVIVE.

1170
00:46:43,435 --> 00:46:44,936
JILL, YOU CAN STOP THAT NOW.

1171
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:46,438
I KNOW YOU MADE UP WITH DADDY.

1172
00:46:46,438 --> 00:46:47,939
YOU DO? HOW?

1173
00:46:47,939 --> 00:46:49,441
OH, JUST A WILD GUESS...

1174
00:46:49,441 --> 00:46:51,443
AND YOUR LIMO JUST PULLED UP.

1175
00:46:51,443 --> 00:46:54,946
WELL, SORRY I DIDN'T GET TO KNOW YOU GUYS ANY BETTER.

1176
00:46:54,946 --> 00:46:56,948
AN ABSOLUTE SHAME.

1177
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:58,450
OKAY, SEE YOU.

1178
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:00,452
BYE BYE.

1179
00:47:00,952 --> 00:47:03,955
I CAN'T BELIEVE JILL'S GONE.

1180
00:47:05,457 --> 00:47:08,460
I CAN'T HELP IT. I OPENED A GATE.
