OKAY, RACHE, THAT'S MUFFIN AND ESPRESSO, $4.50 DOLLARS

00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,507
ROSS, DOUBLE LATTE, $2.75 DOLLARS

CHANDLER, COFFEE AND SCONE, $4.25 DOLLARS

AND PHEEBS, HERBAL TEA, $1.25 DOLLARS.

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,015
SO, ALL TOGETHER, THAT'S $12.75 DOLLARS.

6
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:16,516
THIS COMING FROM THE MAN

7
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,019
WHO COULDN'T SPLIT OUR $80 PHONE BILL IN HALF.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,021
HI. HI.

9
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,523
HOW MUCH DO I OWE FOR THE MUFFIN AND LATTE?

10
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,025
THAT'S ON THE HOUSE

11
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,027
COURTESY OF JOEY TRIBBIANI.

12
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,028
OH, GREAT.

13
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,529
WELL, TELL HIM THANKS.

14
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,532
AND SINCE, UH, JOEY SEEMS LIKE SUCH A NICE GUY

15
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,035
MAYBE WE COULD GO ON A DATE SOMETIME.

16
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,537
WELL, HE'S NOT USED TO WOMEN BEING SO FORWARD

17
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,539
BUT, UH, I COULD CHECK WITH HIM.

18
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,041
HE SAYS IT'S OKAY.

19
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,045
GREAT. THANKS. BYE BYE.

20
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,547
HEY, JOEY, HOW COME OUR STUFF ISN'T FREE?

21
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,549
IT WILL BE WHEN YOU LOOK LIKE THAT

22
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,051
IN A TIGHT SKIRT.

23
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,553
THIS IS GREAT. I'M GETTING MORE DATES THAT EVER.

24
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,055
WAIT A MINUTE.

25
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,557
JOEY, YOU'RE ONLY GIVING AWAY FREE STUFF TO THE PRETTY GIRLS?

26
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,059
JOEY, THAT IS SO GROSS.

27
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,062
HOW ABOUT A SCONE ON THE HOUSE, BABY?

28
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,065
I'M PRETTY.

38
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,107
HEY, DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY GUM?

39
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,608
OH, I DO. I DO.

40
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,112
HERE. SORRY.

41
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,115
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

42
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,618
NO.

43
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,122
WAIT A SECOND...

44
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,625

45
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,629
I KNOW IT'S IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

46
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,131
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD.

47
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,632
ALL RIGHT. SORRY.

48
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,134
I GUESS IT'S IN MY BIG BAG.

49
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,637
SAY, DOES ANYBODY HAVE A GOLDFISH?

50
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,139
OH.

51
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,642
HEY.

52
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,144
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

53
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,645
SHOULDN'T YOU BE AT WORK?

54
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,147
UH, THEY SENT ME HOME.

55
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,648
THEY SAID I CAN'T WORK IF I'M SICK.

56
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,649
 OH!

57
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,650
I'M SO SORRY YOU'RE SICK.

58
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,152
I'M NOT SICK!

59
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,654
I DON'T GET SICK.

60
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,656
GETTING SICK IS FOR WEAKLINGS.

61
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,658
IT'S FOR PANSIES.

62
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,161
HONEY, NO ONE THINKS THAT YOU'RE A PANSY.

63
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,664
BUT WE DO THINK THAT YOU NEED A TISSUE.

64
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,669
I HAVE NOT BEEN SICK IN OVER THREE YEARS.

65
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,171

66
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,672
I THINK YOU'RE SICK

67
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,175
BECAUSE THAT USED TO BE IN YOUR NOSE.

68
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,678
I'M GOING TO GRAB YOU SOME TISSUE.

69
00:02:59,179 --> 00:02:59,679
I I DON'T NEED

70
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,181
A TISSUE!

71
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,182
I'M FINE'D!

72
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,684
WHEN YOU PUT A "D" AT THE END OF "FINE"

73
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,687
YOU'RE NOT FINE.

74
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,191
I'M FINE... 'D.

75
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,692
I'M FINE... 'D.

76
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,693
OKAY.

77
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,196
YOU KNOW, IT'S A REALLY HARD WORD TO SAY.

78
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,697

79
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,210
YES?

80
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,711
HI. IS RACHEL HERE?

81
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,712
I'M HER SISTER.

82
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,214
OH, MY GOD! JILL!

83
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,715
OH, MY GOD! RACHEL!

84
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,217
HI!

85
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,218
OH, MY GOD!

86
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,219
INTRODUCE US.

87
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,721
WELL, THIS IS CHANDLER.

88
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,223
AND YOU KNOW MONICA AND ROSS.

89
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,724
AND THAT'S PHOEBE

90
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,725
AND THAT'S JOEY.

91
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,227
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

92
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:47,727
DON'T!

93
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,235
HONEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

94
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,736
WHICH WHICH SISTER IS THIS?

95
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,739
IS THIS THE SPOILED ONE OR THE ONE THAT BIT HER?

96
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,241
DADDY CUT ME OFF.

97
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,243
NEVER MIND. I GOT IT.

98
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,744
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I SAID TO HIM?

99
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,246
I SAID, "I'M GOING TO HIRE A LAWYER

100
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,747
"AND I'M GOING TO SUE YOU

101
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,748
"AND TAKE ALL YOUR MONEY

102
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,250
AND THEN I'M GOING TO CUT YOU OFF!"

103
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,252
WOW. WHAT DID HE SAY?

104
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,753
HE SAID HE WOULDN'T PAY FOR MY LAWYER.

105
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,257
AND THEN HE TOLD ME TO COME HERE AND LEARN ABOUT THE VALUE OF MONEY

106
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,759
FROM THE ONE DAUGHTER HE'S ACTUALLY PROUD OF.

107
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,261

108
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,762
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

109
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,264
MY DAD'S PROUD OF ME.

110
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,766
MY DAD'S PROUD OF ME.

111
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,268
RACHE...

112
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,269
OH, YEAH, SORRY.

113
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,271
OKAY, HONEY, SO WHAT DID YOU DO

114
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,273
THAT MADE DAD CUT YOU OFF?

115
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,775
OKAY, I BOUGHT A BOAT.

116
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,277
YOU BOUGHT A BOAT?

117
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,779
YEAH, BUT IT WASN'T FOR ME. IT WAS FOR A FRIEND.

118
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,783
BOY, DID WE MAKE FRIENDS WITH THE WRONG SISTER.

119
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,285
I KNEW IT WAS STUPID

120
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,287
AND I KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT

121
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,289
BUT SHE BOUGHT  ME ALL THESE CDs

122
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,791
AND SHE SAID I HAD A REALLY CUTE HAIRCUT.

123
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,295
AND YOUR DADDY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND?

124
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,298
I KNOW. AND, USUALLY, I JUST CRY AND SAY I'M SORRY

125
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,799
AND THEN HE FORGIVES ME.

126
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,803
OH, YES. GOOD CRIERS, THE GREEN GIRLS.

127
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,307
I MEAN... I MEAN THE, UH...

128
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,809
YOU KNOW, THE... THE GREEN SISTERS.

129
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,813
MAN, NO MATTER HOW YOU SAY IT

130
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,317
IT STILL SOUNDS LIKE LIKE YOU'RE TALKING

131
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,818
ABOUT GREEN PEOPLE.

132
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,820
I'M AT ROCK BOTTOM.

133
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,323
JILL, HONEY, I THINK THIS IS THE BEST THING

134
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,325
THAT COULD HAVE EVER HAPPENED TO YOU.

135
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,827
YOU'VE NEEDED TO GET OUT ON YOUR OWN, ANYWAY.

136
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,329
AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN I DID IT

137
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,830
I I, AT FIRST I WAS SCARED

138
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,332
BUT, THEN, LOOK AT ME NOW.

139
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,333
I AM THE ONLY DAUGHTER

140
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,335
THAT DAD IS PROUD OF.

141
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,338
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE HIM.

142
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,340
HOW DOES HE EXPECT ME TO BUY STUFF?

143
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,842
WELL, MAYBE, YOU JUST WON'T BUY STUFF FOR A WHILE.

144
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,844
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

145
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,347
OKAY, THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO.

146
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,848
YOU'RE GOING TO GET A JOB.

147
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,851
YOU'RE GOING TO GET AN APARTMENT.

148
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,355
THEN YOU WILL LIVE OFF THE MONEY THAT YOU EARN.

149
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,357
OKAY. I KNOW THIS IS WHAT YOU DID

150
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,859
BUT THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE ME.

151
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,860
OKAY, BUT IT CAN BE.

152
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,861
IT CAN BE YOU.

153
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,363
AND I'LL HELP YOU

154
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,864
AND YOU CAN STAY WITH US.

155
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,865
RIGHT, PHEEBS?

156
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,867
OF COURSE. YEAH.

157
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,868
OH, THAT'S SO GREAT.

158
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,870
OKAY, I'M REALLY GOING TO DO THIS.

159
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,872
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU GUYS.

160
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,874
OH... I LIKE CARS.

161
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,383
UH, YOU ALL FINISHED HERE? YES.

162
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,385
GREAT.

163
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,889
OKAY, HERE ARE THE TIPS FOR THIS MORNING.

164
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,890
MMM.

165
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,392
JAN GETS $50 DOLLARS, $50 DOLLARS FOR ME

166
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,894
AND JOEY OWES EIGHT DOLLARS.

167
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,896
WHAT?

168
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,898
FOR ALL THE FREE FOOD YOU GAVE AWAY.

169
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,899
WELL, IF IT'S FREE FOOD

170
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,901
HOW COME YOU'RE CHARGING ME FOR IT?

171
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,403
WE DON'T GIVE ANYTHING AWAY

172
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,905
UNLESS IT'S SOMEONE'S BIRTHDAY.

173
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,909
OH... WHA WHAT IF THEY CAME IN THIRD IN A MODELING CONTEST?

174
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,411
NO.

175
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,412
HMM...

176
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,414
SORRY.

177
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,918
I JUST HAD THE HARDEST DAY.

178
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,920
SOME OF THESE ARE SO HEAVY.

179
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,922
JILL, HOW DID YOU PAY FOR ALL THIS?

180
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,425
I THOUGHT YOUR DAD TOOK AWAY YOUR CREDIT CARD.

181
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,428
OH, PLEASE. I MEMORIZED THOSE NUMBERS WHEN I WAS 15.

182
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,932
BUT LOOK AT ALL THE COOL MAKE IT ON MY OWN STUFF I GOT.

183
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,435
THIS IS MY "PLEASE HIRE ME" SWEATER.

184
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,936
AND THESE ARE MY...

185
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,939
"DON'T YOU WANT TO RENT ME THIS APARTMENT?" PANTS.

186
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,942
I DON'T THINK CHARGING NEW CLOTHES TO YOUR DAD

187
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,945
QUALIFIES AS MAKING  IT ON YOUR OWN.

188
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,448
OH, MR. SCIENTIST HAS TO GET ALL TECHNICAL.

189
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,952
SERIOUSLY, I DON'T THINK RACHEL'S GOING TO THINK IT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

190
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,454
SO WHO MADE HER QUEEN OF THE WORLD?

191
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,456
I WOULD LOVE THAT JOB.

192
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,459
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

193
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,960
HEY.

194
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,961
JILL...

195
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,964
DID YOU SHOP?

196
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,466
NO.

197
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,968
THEY DID.

198
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,971
 YEAH, WE WENT SHOPPING!

199
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,974
YOU WENT SHOPPING?

200
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,976
WHAT? AND THEN YOU JUST CAME IN HERE

201
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,978
AND PARADED IT RIGHT UNDER JILL'S NOSE

202
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,980
WHEN YOU KNOW SHE'S TRYING TO QUIT?

203
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,482
WOW, YOU GUYS, IT'S TERRIBLE.

204
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,483
SORRY, JILL.

205
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,984
SORRY SORRY, JILL.

206
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,986
WHAT DID

207
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,987
YOU GET?

208
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,489
OH, WELL, ALL RIGHT.

209
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,990
I GOT... THANK YOU.

210
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,993
I GOT THIS "I WANT A JOB" SWEATER.

211
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:14,994
OH.

212
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,497
AND THEN I GOT, UH...

213
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,500
THESE ARE APARTMENT PANTS.

214
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,504
APARTMENT PANTS?

215
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,507
YEAH. YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF THEM?

216
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,508
NO, OF COURSE...

217
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,510
OF COURSE I'VE HEARD OF THEM.

218
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,512
ROSS, WHAT DID YOU GET?

219
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,513
HUH?

220
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:38,518
I GOT THIS... THIS.

221
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,521
A PASHMINA?

222
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,023
YEAH.

223
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,027
I I LOVE THESE BABIES.

224
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,031
REALLY?

225
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,032
MMM.

226
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,534
ROSS, WHAT'S A PASHMINA?

227
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,036
IT'S A RUG.

228
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,540
JILL.

229
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,542

230
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,544
I'M SORRY, RACHEL.

231
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,045
OH, COME ON.

232
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,548
YOU REALLY THINK THAT'S GOING TO WORK ON ME?

233
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,549
I INVENTED THAT.

234
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,050
RIGHT.

235
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,052
BUT I AM SORRY.

236
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,554
ALL RIGHT, IT'S OKAY.

237
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,555
ONE LITTLE SETBACK

238
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,056
IS OKAY.

239
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,058
BUT JUST DON'T LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN, ALL RIGHT?

240
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,560
OKAY.

241
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,061
NOW, SINCE DADDY PAID FOR ALL THIS STUFF

242
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,063
I SHOULD TAKE IT ALL AWAY

243
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,566
BUT I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE...

244
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,568
THE THE PASHMINA.

245
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,071
AND THE AND THE, UH, PANTS.

246
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,574
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE IT ALL AWAY

247
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,076
BECAUSE THAT WAY, YOU'LL JUST REALLY LEARN THE LESSON, OKAY?

248
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,578
ALL RIGHTY.

249
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,579
WELL, I'M GOING

250
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,080
TO RUN A COUPLE OF ERRANDS

251
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,582
AND I WILL SEE YOU AT DINNER.

252
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,085

253
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,588
SHE TOOK ALL MY STUFF.

254
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,090
YEAH. EVERYTHING BUT...

255
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,592
THE LITTLE BLUE ONE.

256
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:53,593

257
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,094
OH! THAT'S THE BEST ONE!

258
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,597
OH, MY GOD! THANK YOU SO MUCH!

259
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,098
WELL, HEY...

260
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,602
OH, MY GOSH, THAT WAS SO LAME.

261
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,103
LIKE A PASHMIN A COULD BE A RUG.

262
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,105
OH, YEAH, WELL, HOW ABOUT YOU WITH

263
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,107
"OH, I'M SORRY..."

264
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,109
OH, SHUT UP! IT WASN'T LIKE THAT AT ALL.

265
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,111
WHAT ABOUT- WHAT ABOUT WHAT I SAID

266
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,613
ABOUT THE APARTMENT PANTS?

267
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,114
HOW DUMB WAS I? HA!

268
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,619
WERE YOU THIS CU TE IN HIGH SCHOOL?

269
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,120
OH, STOP.

270
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,622
NO, YOU STOP.

271
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,623
NO, YOU STOP.

272
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,624
YOU STOP.

273
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,125
OKAY, OKAY, WHY DON'T I SIT HERE

274
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,627
AND THEN YOU'LL BOTH STOP IT.

275
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,632
OKAY, SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

276
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,134
LET'S DO SOMETHING CRAZY!

277
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,638
I KNOW. LET'S REST AND DRINK LOTS OF FLUIDS.

278
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,642
OKAY, I'LL REST, BUT, YOU KNOW, IF I'M GOING TO BED

279
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,644
THEN YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

280
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,145

281
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,148
SEE, THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST

282
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,652
IF YOU WEREN'T ALL DRIPPY HERE.

283
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:59,158
ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO GET WITH THIS?

284
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,665
YEAH, I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD SAY THAT

285
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,166
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE HEALTHY.

286
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,670
OH, COME ON.

287
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,171

288
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,174
DON'T TAKE THIS PERSONALLY, OKAY?

289
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,678
IT'S JUST THAT I JUST CAN'T HAVE SEX WITH A SICK PERSON.

290
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,179
I'M WITH YOU, CHANDLER.

291
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,182
I MEAN, I CAN'T HAVE SEX WITH A SICK PERSON, EITHER.

292
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,183
IT'S DISGUSTING.

293
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,184
BUT I'M NOT SICK.

294
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,686
LET ME PROVE IT TO YOU.

295
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:33,192
WE ARE TWO HEALTHY PEOPLE IN THE PRIBE OF LIBE.

296
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,695
SEE, THAT'S THE THING.

297
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,198
I WOULD LIKE TO STAY IN THE PRAHM UB LABH.

298
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,703

299
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,207
OH. OKAY. NOW I'LL DO IT.

300
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,211
HEY.

301
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,713
HEY. WHAT'S UP?

302
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,717
UM... I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD MAYBE KNOW.

303
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,219
WELL, IT BETTER NOT BE ABOUT THE APARTMENT PANTS

304
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,223
BECAUSE I JUST PITCHED THE IDEA TO MY BOSS AT RALPH LAUREN

305
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,224
AND SHE LOVED IT.

306
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,726
NO, NO. IT'S JUST...

307
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,728
I WAS, UM, I WAS WITH ROSS AND JILL

308
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,230
AFTER YOU LEFT AND, UM, I'M PRETTY SURE

309
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,733
I SAW A LITTLE SPARK BETWEEN THEM.

310
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,734
WHAT?

311
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,736
YEAH, I MEAN IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING

312
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,237
BUT I JUST WANTED TO WARN YOU

313
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,239
THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THERE.

314
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,741
WITH ROSS AND JILL?

315
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,742
YEAH.

316
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,244
WITH ROSS AND MY SISTER?

317
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,747
YEAH.

318
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,250
WITH MY SISTER, JILL, AND MY EX BOYFRIEND, ROSS?

319
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,752
YEAH.

320
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,754
OH, THERE IS NO WAY.

321
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,755
OKAY, THEN.

322
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,756
OH, MY GOD!

323
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,758
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT!

324
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,759
I DON'T REALLY LIKE IT

325
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,260
WHEN ROSS GOES OUT WITH ANYONE

326
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,261
BUT MY SISTER?!

327
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,764
ISN'T THAT LIKE INCEST OR SOMETHING?

328
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,765
OH, MY GOD

329
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,767
AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE SEX.

330
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,269
OH, NO, AND WHAT IF HE MARRIES HER, TOO?

331
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,771
OH, THIS IS JUST TERRIBLE.

332
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,773
THIS IS JUST TERRIBLE.

333
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,774
AND I CAN'T STOP IT.

334
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,275
I DON'T OWN ROSS, YOU KNOW.

335
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,276
AND JILL, SHE SHOULD BE ABLE

336
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,779
TO DO WHATEVER IT IS THAT SHE WANTS TO DO.

337
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,280
AND, OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE

338
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,282
ROSS IS MARRYING MY LITTLE SISTER.

339
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,284
OH, MY GOD. THIS IS JUST THE WORST THING

340
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,286
THAT COULD HAVE EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

341
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:11,791
BUT GREAT NEWS ABOUT THE APARTMENT PANTS, HUH?

342
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,294
THAT'LL BE $3.85 DOLLARS.

343
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,796
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YESTERDAY, YOU SAID

344
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,798
I WAS TOO PRETTY TO PAY FOR STUFF.

345
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:23,302
IT'S JUST I CAN'T BECAUSE MY MANAGER SAID THAT...

346
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,806

347
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,809

352
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,819
HEY, THAT'S WEIRD.

353
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,320
TODAY'S MY BIRTHDAY, TOO.

354
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,823
YEAH? NOT IN HERE IT ISN'T.

355
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,326
SORRY I'M LATE.

356
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,327
WHAT'S UP?

357
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,328
OH, HI.

358
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,330
UH, YOU KNOW, I JUST WANTED TO SEE

359
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,834
IF THERE WERE ANY LEADS ON THE OLD JOB FRONT.

360
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,337
OH, NO, BUT I JUST WALKED PAST THREE SALES AND I DIDN'T GO IN.

361
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,338
HOW STRONG AM I?

362
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,840
OH...

363
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,341
THAT IS GREAT.

364
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,844
HEY, YOU KNOW WHO DOESN'T HAVE TO JOB HUNT?

365
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,845
ROSS.

366
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,847
HE WORKS AT THE UNIVERSITY.

367
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:08,848
YEAH.

368
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,350
SO YOU KNOW THAT? YOU GUYS TALKED ABOUT THAT?

369
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,853
SO YOU GET ALONG? SO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GO OUT?

370
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,855
ME GO OUT WITH ROSS?

371
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,857
NO.

372
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,858
GOD, NO!

373
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,359
WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU THINK THAT?

374
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,361
IT'S JUST... PHOEBE... SAID SHE, YOU KNOW

375
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,363
THOUGHT SHE SAW SOMETHING BETWEEN YOU GUYS.

376
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,364
NO.

377
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,866
MEAN, HE'S NICE.

378
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,367
HE'S THE KIND OF GUY YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH

379
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,369
BUT HE'S NOT THE KIND OF GUY YOU DATE.

380
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,871
I MEAN, HE'S THE KIND OF GUY YOU DATE

381
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,872
BECAUSE YOU DID, BUT...

382
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,874
ME...

383
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,376
NOT SO MUCH.

384
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,878
WHY NOT SO MUCH?

385
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,880
UM, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

386
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,382
I MEAN, IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH ROSS?

387
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,884
OH, NO, NO, NO..

388
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,385
HE'S JUST... I DON'T KNOW.

389
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,888
YOU KNOW, HE'S JUST A LITTLE... BOOKISH.

390
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,390
ARE YOU SAYING HE'S A GEEK?

391
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,392
YOU THINK SO, TOO?

392
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,896
NO. NO, ROSS IS NOT A GEEK.

393
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,897
FINE.

394
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,899
THEN LET'S JUST SAY HE'S NOT MY TYPE.

395
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,901
HANDSOME IS NOT YOUR TYPE?

396
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,903
SMART, KIND, GOOD KISSER?

397
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,405
WHAT? THOSE THINGS AREN'T ON YOUR LIST?

398
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,907
ROSS IS A GREAT GUY.

399
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,909
YOU WOULD BE LUCKY TO BE WITH HIM.

400
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,911
WELL, OKAY, IF IT MEANS THAT MUCH TO YOU

401
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,912
THEN I'LL JUST ASK HIM OUT.

402
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,913
OH, NO, NO.

403
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,414
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

404
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,415
I WAS JUST TRYING...

405
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,417
YOU KNOW WHAT, RACHEL. YOU'RE RIGHT.

406
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,419
YOU KNOW, HE HAS BEEN REALLY NICE TO ME.

407
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,922
YEAH, BUT HE'S NOT YOUR TYPE.

408
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,924
YEAH, BUT MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD THING.

409
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,927
YOU KNOW, I'M DOING ALL THESE DIFFERENT SORTS OF THINGS.

410
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,429
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST TRY DATING A GEEK, TOO.

411
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:35,434
YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO TRY TOO MUCH TOO FAST.

412
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,436
YOU KNOW, I MEAN

413
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,939
YOU DO REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LITTLE GIRL

414
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,941
WHO TRIED TOO MUCH TOO FAST, DON'T YOU?

415
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,943
WHAT?

416
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,947
SHE SHE DIED, JILL.

417
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,954
 CHANDLER!

418
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,957
OH, WHAT IS IT, HONEY?

419
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,458
YOU NEED SOME TEA?

420
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,960
SOME SOUP?

421
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,463
OH, OH, OH!

422
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,968
CALLING DR. BING...

423
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,470
DR. BING, TO THE BED.

424
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,472
OH, GEEZ, HONEY, I THOUGHT...

425
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,474
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ASLEEP.

426
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,476
HOW CAN I BE ASLEEP

427
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,479
KNOWING THAT YOU WERE IN THE NEXT ROOM?

428
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,482
IWAS ASLEEP.

429
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,486

430
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,487
OH, NO, NO, NO, HONEY.

431
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:29,989
YOU KNOW WHAT'S SEXY?

432
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:30,990
LAYERS.

433
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,994
LAYERS ARE SEXY... AND BLANKETS ARE SEXY

434
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,996
AND, OH, HOT WATER BOTTLES ARE SEXY.

435
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,997
COME ON, GET INTO BED.

436
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,999
I WANT TO PROVE THAT I'M NOT SICK.

437
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,002
I WANT TO MAKE YOU FEEL... AS GOOD AS I FEEL.

438
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,003

439
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,506
WOULD YOU PLEASE GET SOME REST?

440
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,507
I'M FINE...

441
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,508

442
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,012

443
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,513
YOU'RE COUGHING.

444
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,015
NO, I'M NOT.

445
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,516
NO, I'M NOT. I'M LAUGHING.

446
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,019

447
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,021
AT WHAT?

448
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,023
OH, JUST SOMETHING I HEARD BEFORE.

449
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,024

450
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,526
OH, NO. I DON'T WANT IT TO SPOIL...

451
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,529
THE MOOD.

452
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,531

453
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,037
?? HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU. ??

454
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,540
YOU'RE PAYING FOR THAT.

455
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,542
WHAT? NO, NO. IT'S HER BIRTHDAY.

456
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,044
YOU'VE SUNG HAPPY BIRTHDAY

457
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,545
TO 20 DIFFERENT WOMEN TODAY.

458
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,047
BUT IT REALLY...

459
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,548
YOU ARE NO LONGER AUTHORIZED

460
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,050

461
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,552

00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,558
HI. HI.

464
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,061
DID YOU TELL YOUR SISTER TO ASK ME OUT?

465
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,562
WELL, YEAH...

466
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,563
OH, WOW!

467
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,066
I MEAN, WOW!

468
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,069
I THINK SHE'S CUTE

469
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,071
BUT I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT

470
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,573
OF GOING OUT WITH HER-- NEVER!

471
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,075

472
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,577
YEAH, BUT AFTER YOU SAID IT WAS OKAY, I FIGURED, WHY NOT?

473
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:03,082
OH, SO... SO, NOT REALLY NEVER?

474
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,083
I HAVE TO SAY

475
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,086
YOU ARE A MUCH BIGGER  PERSON THAN I AM.

476
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,588
I MEAN, AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH

477
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,090
I JUST...

478
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,591
I WISH I HAD A BROTHER TO RECIPROCATE.

479
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,593
OH.

480
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,095
IF YOU EVER WANT TO GO OUT WITH MONICA

481
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,096
YOU HAVE MY BLESSING.

482
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,597

483
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,102
CHANDLER...

486
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,109
STRUCK DOWN IN THE PRIBE OF LIBE.

487
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,613
OKAY, FINE, I ADMIT IT.

488
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,615
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

489
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,117
WILL YOU PLEASE RUB THIS ON MY CHEST?

490
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,121
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

491
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,123
YOU ARE NOT GETTING ME THIS WAY.

492

I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP.

493
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,127
NO, NO, NO, NO!

494
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,130

00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,652
SO, YOU'RE JUST...

497
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,155
KIND OF RUBBING IT ON YOURSELF?

00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,657
YEAH?

499
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,659
IT'S NICE.

500
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,162
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

501
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,663
IS THIS TURNING YOU ON?

502
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,166
YES.

503
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,667
WELL, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

504
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,669
WHAT IS IT? IS IT THE RUBBING OR THE SMELL?

505
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,172
IT'S ALL VERY, VERY GOOD.

506
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,174
OH...

512
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,191
ABOUT NEVER SLEEPING WITH SICK PEOPLE?

513
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,193
WELL, THAT WAS BEFORE ALL THE...

514
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,195
VAPORIZING ACTION.

515
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,698
OKAY, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HAVE SEX.

516
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,699
OKAY!

517
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,204

SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

523
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,219
WELL, I... I DON'T LIKE IT.

00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,721
REALLY?

525
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,723
IT'S KIND OF SLUTTY.

526
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,726

00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,273

544
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,288
WHY AREN'T YOU HOME YET?

545
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,789
 IS SOMEONE THERE?

00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,293
OH, YEAH, IT'S ME.

558
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,828
OH, SHE IS A SLUT!

559
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,829
OH, MY GOD.

560
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,331
ROSS IS ON A DATE WITH YOUR SISTER?

561
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,332
HOW WEIRD IS THAT?

562
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,833
OH, MY GOD, LOOK, LOOK.

563
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,335
HE'S TAKING OFF HER CLOTHES.

564
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,837
HE'S TAKING OFF HER COAT.

565
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,340
 OH, THIS IS JUST TERRIBLE.

566
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,342
OH, NO, IT'S NOT. IT'S A FIRST DATE.

567
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,843
I'M SURE THAT NOTHING IS GOING TO...

568
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,849
OH!

569
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,352
OOH HOO...

570
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,853
HE'S GOING TO GET SOME.

571
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,359
OF THE GLARE...

572
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,861
FROM THE STREETLIGHT... OUT OF HIS APARTMENT.

573
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:46,865
YOU KNOW, SO, UM... HE'S CLOSED THE DRAPES THERE

574
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,869
SO HE CAN HAVE A NICE, PLEASANT CONVERSATION

575
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,871
WITH YOUR LITTLE SISTER.

576
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,374
WELL, I'M OFF TO BED.

577
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:09,087
I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

578
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:12,391
YOU BETTER NOT GET ME SICK.

579
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,398
I NEED SOME FRUIT OR SOME...

580
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,400
JUICE OR SOME...

581
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,904
OR SOME NOTHING.

582
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,408
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE. WHO TOOK OUR FOOD?

583
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,410
CAN I INTEREST YOU IN A SLICE OF LASAGNA?

584
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,412
OR A DRUMSTICK?

585
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,413
NO, THANKS.

586
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,414
ARE YOU SURE?

587
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,415
IT'S ON THE HOUSE.

588
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:37,916
NO, THANKS.

589
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,418
HOW ABOUT GOING OUT WITH ME FRIDAY NIGHT?

590
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,419
NO, THANKS.

591
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,421
AW, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
