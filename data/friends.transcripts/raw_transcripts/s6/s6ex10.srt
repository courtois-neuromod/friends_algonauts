1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,005
LET ME ASK YOU, WHY IS EVERYBODY USING

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,506
THESE TINY LITTLE LIGHTS NOWADAYS?

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,508
I REMEMBER WHEN PEOPLE USED TO USE BIG LIGHTS.

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,511
.
THAT'S A GOOD STORY, GRANDPA

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,514
HEY.

6
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,016
 HEY.

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,517
WOW.

8
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,519
MONICA'S LETTING OTHER PEOPLE HELP DECORATE HER TREE.

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,022
DID SOMEONE GET HER DRUNK AGAIN, OR...?

10
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,025
HAVING A PERFECTLY DECORATED TREE

11
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,526
IS NOT WHAT CHRISTMAS IS ABOUT.

12
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,528
IT'S ABOUT BEING WITH THE PEOPLE THAT YOU LOVE.

13
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,030
THAT IS NICE

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,531
AND WE'RE DONE, TA DA!

15
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,534
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

16
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,037
IT JUST DOESN'T QUITE FEEL LIKE CHRISTMAS TO ME.

17
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,039
OH, YEAH.

18
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,544
SEE, NOW IT FEELS LIKE CHRISTMAS.

28
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,586
AND THAT'S THE STORY OF THE DREIDEL.

29
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,590
NOW, SOME PEOPLE TRACE THE CHRISTMAS TREE

30
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,092
BACK TO THE EGYPTIANS

31
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,594
WHO USED TO BRING GREEN PALM BRANCHES

32
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,597
INTO THEIR HUTS ON THE SHORTEST DAY OF THE YEAR

33
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,600
SYMBOLIZING LIFE'S TRIUMPH OVER DEATH

34
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,103
AND THAT WAS, LIKE, 4,000 YEARS AGO.

35
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,105
SO, PRETTY MUCH AROUND THE SAME TIME

36
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,107
THAT YOU STARTED TELLING THIS STORY.

37
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,610
HEY, YOU GUYS.

38
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,112
HEY, JOE, WHAT'S UP?

39
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,114
I HAD TO GET OUT OF THE APARTMENT.

40
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,117
JANINE IS, LIKE, STRETCHING ALL OVER THE PLACE.

41
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,119
YOU KNOW, EVERYWHERE I LOOK, SHE'S, LIKE...

42
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,626
I CAN SEE WHY THAT'S HARD TO RESIST.

43
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,628
I LIKE HER SO MUCH!

44
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,130
OH, I'M SORRY, SWEETIE

45
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,631
THAT SHE DOESN'T FEEL THE SAME WAY.

46
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,633
I KNOW, AND SHE'S SO SWEET.

47
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,137
I JUST WANT TO FEED HER GRAPES AND BRUSH HER HAIR.

48
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,640
YOU ARE AWARE THAT SHE'S NOT A MONKEY, RIGHT?

49
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:26,146
I AM SO OVER JANINE.

50
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,647
I MEAN...

51
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,649
YEAH, AT FIRST I THOUGHT SHE WAS HOT

52
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,651
BUT NOW, SHE'S LIKE OLD NEWS.

53
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,652
HI, GUYS.

54
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,654
JANINE!

55
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,655
COFFEE TO GO, PLEASE.

56
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,158
I JUST GOT A CALL TO BE A DANCER

57
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,660
ON A TELEVISION SPECIAL FOR NEW YEAR'S EVE.

58
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,664
IT'S CALLED SOME SORT OF "DICKIN' ROCKIN' DICKIE EVE."

59
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,667
HOLD IT.

60
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,669
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

61
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,672
DICK CLARK'S NEW YEAR'S ROCKIN' EVE?

62
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,174
YEAH. THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

63
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,178
OH, MY GOD!

64
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,180
WE LOVE THAT SHOW.

65
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,681
ROSS AND I HAVE BEEN WATCHING IT

66
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,683
SINCE I CAN REMEMBER. YEAH!

67
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,186
OH, YOU'RE STILL JUST A LITTLE FAT GIRL INSIDE

68
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,687
AREN'T YOU?

69
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,690
WELL, I'M GOING TO BE ON IT THIS YEAR.

70
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,192
I'M GOING TO BE ONE OF THE PARTY PEOPLE.

71
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,194
YOU'RE GOING TO BE A PARTY PERSON?!

72
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,197
THOSE GUYS ROCK THE MOST!

73
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,199
WELL, THEY SAID I SHOULD BRING SOMEONE.

74
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,700
DO YOU WANT TO BE MY DANCE PARTNER?

75
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,202
TOTALLY!

76
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,703
I WOULD LOVE TO SP END NEW YEAR'S WITH YOU.

77
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,705
NO, WELL, ACTUALLY, THEY'RE TAPING TOMORROW.

78
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,706
I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY.

79
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,708
OH, WELL, YOU SEE, HOW IT WORKS IS

80
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,710
THE PART WITH DICK CLARK IN TIMES SQUARE

81
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,212
IS ACTUALLY LIVE

82
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,715
BUT THEY TAPE SOME OF THE PARTY STUFF AHEAD OF TIME.

83
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,218
YEAH, NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT.

84
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,721
YEAH, WELL, DO YOU GUYS WANT TO COME, TOO?

85
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,223
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

86
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,725
WE ARE THERE.

87
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,728

88
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,730
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?

89
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,732
WELL, I USED TO DATE HIM

90
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,734
BUT YOU'RE STILL GOING OUT WITH HER.

91
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,238
OH, THANKS.

92
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,240
GREAT. SO WE CAN ALL GO TOGETHER.

93
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,242
I GOT TO RUN. I'LL CATCH YOU LATER.

94
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,244
BYE, JANINE.

95
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,748
DID SHE JUST ASK ME OUT ON A DATE?

96
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,252
I DON'T THINK SO.

97
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,753
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? SHE JUST INVITED HIM

98
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,755
TO THE BIGGEST PARTY OF THE MILLENNIUM.

99
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,757
YEAH, BUT SHE ALSO INVITED YOU AND ROSS.

100
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,259
HONEY, I'M... I'M SORRY

101
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,761
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WAS A ROMANTIC THING.

102
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,264
OH... MAYBE. BUT HEY, I KNOW HOW I CAN FIND OUT.

103
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,766
WE'RE GOING TO A NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY, RIGHT?

104
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,768
SO AT MIDNIGHT, I CAN KISS HER.

105
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,271
AND IF SHE KISSES ME BACK, GREAT, YOU KNOW?

106
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,774
BUT IF SHE SAYS, "DUDE, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?"

107
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,777
I CAN SAY, "IT WASN'T ME; IT WAS NEW YEAR'S."

108
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,780
WELL, THAT'S A LOT BETTER

109
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,283
THAN ROSS TRYING TO KISS ME IN HIGH SCHOOL

110
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,286
AND SAYING THAT HE DID IT BECAUSE HE NEEDED CHAPSTICK.

111
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,290
IT WAS A DRY DAY.

112
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,295
WE ARE GOING TO

113
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,298
DICK CLARK'S NEW YEAR'S ROCKIN' EVE!

114
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,300
OH, MY GOD!

115
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,302
OH, MY GOD!

116
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,804
OH, MY GOD.

117
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,313
OKAY, NOW LISTEN UP.

118
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,314
I'VE BEEN ON SETS BEFORE.

119
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,815
LET ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE ADVICE.

120
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,318
IT'S A SHOW, BUT WE'RE JUST DANCING, OKAY?

121
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,319
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

122
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,820
THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER:

123
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,322
STAY COOL.

124
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,823
GOT IT.

125
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,827
OH, MY GOD, IT'S JUST LIKE I DREAMED IT!

126
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,830
OKAY, EVERYONE, GATHER UP.

127
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,332
 EXCUSE US.

128
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,334
EXCUSE US.

129
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,835
HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

130
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,837
THE MUSIC'S GOING TO START, YOU'RE GOING TO DANCE.

131
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,839
WE'RE GOING TO TAPE YOU; DON'T LOOK AT THE CAMERA.

132
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,840
ANY QUESTIONS?

133
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,342
YEAH, I HAVE A QUESTION.

134
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,344
WHEN IS THIS GOING TO AIR?

135
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,846
YEAH.

136
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,848
NOW, YOU GUYS, DANCE OVER THERE.

137
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,849
YOU GUYS, OVER THERE.

138
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,851
I WANT YOU TWO RIGHT AROUND HERE

139
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,852
AND EVERYONE ELSE, SPREAD OUT.

140
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,854
YOU KNOW, WE'D RATHER NOT DANCE TOGETHER

141
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,356
BECAUSE, UM, SEE, WE'RE BROTHER AND SISTER.

142
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,857
YEAH. IT WOULD SEEM KIND OF WEIRD.

143
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,860
WOULD IT SEEM AS WEIRD AS COMING ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE

144
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,362
AND THEN HAVING TO GO HOME RIGHT NOW?

145
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,863
ROSS.

146
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,367
SO WHEN IS  IT GOING TO AIR?

147
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,873
OKAY, PHEEBS, YOU LOOK IN THE KITCHEN.

148
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,375
I WILL LOOK IN THE BACK CLOSET.

149
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,376
I CAN SAVE YOU TIME, LADIES.

150
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,878
I'M RIGHT HERE.

151
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,879
YEAH.

152
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,382
CHANDLER, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A WALK?

153
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,883
THIS DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.

154
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,884
WE ARE LOOKING FOR

155
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,886
OUR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS FROM MONICA.

156
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,888
WHAT? THAT'S TERRIBLE.

157
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,390
NO, NO, WE DO IT EVERY YEAR.

158
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,393
OH, WELL, THAT MAKES IT NOT TERRIBLE.

159
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,895
NO, YEAH. WE NEVER FIND THEM.

160
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:40,400
SHE'S ALWAYS BESTED US, THAT WILY... MINX.

161
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,901
DON'T WORRY.

162
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,903
WE'RE JUST GOING TO SEARCH HERE FOR AN HOUR

163
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,905
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER TO JOEY'S AND SEARCH, OKAY?

164
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,407
NO, NOT OKAY.

165
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,908
YOU CAN'T LOOK FOR MONICA'S PRESENTS.

166
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,909
OH, NO, WE HAVE TO.

167
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,412
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO, AND YOU CAN'T

168
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,914
BECAUSE I LIVE HERE, TOO.

169
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,917
WELL, THEN, YOU SHOULD LOOK WITH US.

170
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,419
WHY?

171
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,420
CHANDLER, AREN'T YOU WORRIED

172
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,422
ABOUT WHAT TO GET MONICA FOR CHRISTMAS?

173
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,924
NO. I HAVE A GREAT IDEA FOR A PRESENT FOR HER.

174
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,428
OH, THAT'S IT, "A GREAT IDEA"?

175
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,429
CHANDLER, THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

176
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,431
WHAT IF SHE GETS YOU A GREAT PRESENT

177
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,432
TWO MEDIUM PRESENTS

178
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,933
AND THEN A BUNCH OF LITTLE PRESENTS

179
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,436
AND YOU'VE JUST GOTTEN HER ONE GREAT PRESENT?

180
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,438
I MEAN, THAT'S JUST GO ING TO MAKE HER FEEL BAD.

181
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,440
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT TO HER, CHANDLER?

182
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,941
WHY? WHY?

183
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,444
IF I HELPED, WE COULD FIND THEM FASTER.

184
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,945
THAT'S RIGHT.

185
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,448
OOH, WE HAVE A LIVE ONE.

186
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,949
IT'S A MACY'S BAG.

187
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,451
YEAH.

188
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,953
OOH, WHO'S IT FOR?

189
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,957
"DEAR LOSERS, DO YOU REALLY THINK

190
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,460
I'D HIDE PRESENTS UNDER THE COUCH?"

191
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,464
"P.S.: CHANDLER, I KNEW THEY'D BREAK YOU."

192
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,470
UH OH. SHE MAY BE ON TO US.

193
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,472
WE ARE SO GOING TO FIND THEM THIS YEAR.

194
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,474
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS SAID YOU WERE

195
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,975
GOING TO GO ACROSS THE HALL AND LOOK.

196
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,978
YOU DON'T... YOU DON'T  DO THAT EVERY YEAR, DO YOU?

197
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,979
YEAH.

198
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,980
YOU DON'T, LIKE

199
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,982
GO INTO THE BACK OF MY CLOSET

200
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,485
AND LOOK UNDER MY GYM BAG OR ANYTHING.

201
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,488
NO. WE NEVER DO THAT.

202
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,493
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE JOEY GAVE ME SOME STUFF TO STORE

203
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,994
THAT I'VE NEVER

204
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,996
SEEN BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

205
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,999
OKAY, THAT DID NOT JUST HAPPEN.

206
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,509
OKAY, HERE COMES ANOTHER CAMERA.

207
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,511
RIGHT. NO BIGGIE; STAY LOOSE.

208
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,022
WHY DO THEY KEEP DOING THAT?

209
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,024
YOU KNOW, IF WE WANT TO GET ON CAMERA

210
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,026
WE HAVE TO GET UP ON ONE OF THOSE PLATFORMS.

211
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,028
THEY'VE BEEN TAPING THOSE PEOPLE UP THERE ALL DAY.

212
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,530
RIGHT.

213
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,537
HEY, WHAT DID YOU GUYS DO TO GET UP ON THERE?

214
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,038
WE LEARNED HOW TO DANCE.

215
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,540
OH, YEAH?

216
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,041
WELL, WHEN YOU LEARNED HOW TO DANCE

217
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,544
DID YOU FORGET HOW  TO PUT ON UNDERPANTS?

218
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,545
YEAH.

219
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,551
HEY, YOU'RE A GOOD DANCER.

220
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,552
REALLY?

221
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,553
YEAH, WELL, YOU'D BE BETTER

222
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,054
IF YOU JUST LOOSENED YOUR HIPS A LITTLE.

223
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,055
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

224
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,057
WELL, LIKE THIS.

225
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,060
THAT'S IT.

226
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,562
JUST FEEL THE RHYTHM.

227
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,563
THAT'S BETTER.

228
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,566
UH HUH.

229
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,067
OKAY, YOU'RE DANCING WITH THAT GIRL OVER THERE.

230
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,569
NO, NO, NO. WE'RE TOGETHER.

231
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,570
YEAH, WE CAME TOGETHER.

232
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,572
I DON'T SEE IT.

233
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,075
YOU ARE DANCING WITH THE TALL GUY OVER THERE.

234
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,577
TALL GUY, RAISE YOUR HAND.

235
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,578
NO, NO, HEY, BUDDY.

236
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,580
PLEASE LET ME DANCE WITH THAT GIRL.

237
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,082
I REALLY LIKE HER AND I THINK I HAVE A SHOT.

238
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,584
REALLY? YOU THINK SO?

239
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,585
YEAH. I DON'T.

240
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,601
I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING AT JOEY...

241
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,602
HEY, WHOA, WHOA.

242
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,604
YEAH, WE FOUND THEM.

243
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,106
THEY WERE IN THE GUEST ROOM CLOSET BEHIND SOME COATS.

244
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,108
YEAH, AND YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT

245
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,109
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CRAP.

246
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,613
THOSE ARE MY GIFTS.

247
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,114
I GOT THOSE FOR YOU.

248
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,619
OH, THANKS, CHANDLER.

249
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,620
THEY'RE GREAT.

250
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,622
 WELL, CHANDLER

251
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,125
THEN WHAT IS THIS VERY WEIRD METAL "A," "Z" THING?

252
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,627
THOSE ARE BOOKENDS.

253
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,629
THAT'S A GREAT GIFT.

254
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,130
OH, OKAY, I'M SORRY.

255
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,132
THANK YOU FOR MY "AZ."

256
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,638
MAKE SURE YOU PUT ALL THAT STUFF BACK IN THE CLOSET, OKAY?

257
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,139
YES, OKAY.

258
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,141
OH, BY THE WAY, I JUST GOT TO SAY

259
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,645
I THINK IT'S REALLY NICE OF YOU THAT EVEN AFTER YOU'VE MOVED

260
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,147
YOU STILL KEEP STORING THAT STUFF FOR JOEY.

261
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,665
HEY, DANCING GIRL.

262
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:09,168
CAN I... CAN I  GO TO THE BATHROOM?

263
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,171
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

264
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,173
YEAH. THERE YOU GO.

265
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,179
LOOKING GOOD, GELLERS.

266
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,682
WE KNOW.

267
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,683
HEY, LOOK.

268
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,184
YOU KNOW THAT SNIPPY GUY OVER THERE?

269
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,687
HE'S THE ONE WHO DECIDES WHO GETS ON THE PLATFORM.

270
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,688
WE SHOULD GO DANCE BY HIM.

271
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,189
OKAY.

272
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,198
OKAY, EVERYBODY HOLD.

276
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,714

277
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,215
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

278
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,218
WOULD IT HELP IF I WEREN'T WEARING UNDERPANTS?

279
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,720
MONICA!

280
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,721

281
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,225
HOW ABOUT ME?

282
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,235
HEY, TALL GUY.

283
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,238

284
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,740

00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,241
SHE'S NICE, HUH?

286
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,744

287
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,247
YEAH, YEAH. OKAY.

288
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,751
UH, LOOK, BUDDY, I CAME WITH THAT GIRL.

289
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,753
AND I HAD THIS PLAN TO KISS HER

290
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,254
AT THE NEW YEAR'S COUNTDOWN.

291
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,256
I'M TRYING TO WIN HER OVER, YOU KNOW?

292
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,758
SO I WAS WONDERING...

293
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,259
I DON'T THINK SO.

294
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,260
OH, COME ON, MAN.

295
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,763
YOU CAN DANCE WITH MY PARTNER.

296
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,264
SHE'S REAL MELLOW.

297
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,267
LOOK, YOU, UH... YOU DATING THIS GIRL YOU CAME WITH?

298

299
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,270
THAT MAYBE I COULD, YOU KNOW...

300
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,273
NO, NO, SHE'S FAIR GAME IF YOU ASK ME.

301
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,274
SORRY, BUDDY.

302
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,276

303
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,778
HEY, YOU KNOW, FAIR IS FAIR.

304
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,279
I MEAN, WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT YOU'RE RIGHT.

305
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,781

306
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,283
HEY!

00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,289
HEY, MAN, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WET HIS PANTS.

00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,791

YOU GUYS, I'M TELLING YOU

313
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,799
MONICA WOULD NOT HIDE THE PRESENTS DOWN HERE.

314
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,800
NO, BUT SHE DID-- LOOK.

315
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,302
THERE'S THAT OLD HIPPIE I'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

316
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,806
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, IF THEY ARE HERE

317
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,808
GUNTHER KNOWS ABOUT IT.

318
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,810
OH, AND I COULD GET IT OUT OF HIM.

319
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,311
HE'S HAD A HUGE CRUSH ON ME.

320
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,813
OH...

321
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,815
NO, NO, THAT'S NOT FAIR TO PLAY WITH HIS HEAD, THOUGH.

322
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:36,816
NO, YOU DO IT, RACHEL.

323
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:37,817
OKAY.

324
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,321
HEY, GUNTHER.

325
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,323

GETTING TO BE THAT HOLIDAY TIME AGAIN, HUH?

00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,830

328
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,833
AND YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING, YOU KNOW

329
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,335
SINCE IT'S THE TIME OF GIVING GIFTS...

330
00:13:56,335 --> 00:14:00,339
I WAS WONDERING, ARE THERE ANY PRESENTS AROUND HERE FOR ME

331
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,842
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

332
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,845
HEY, I THINK I FOUND THEM.

333
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,347
THAT'S THE TOYS FOR TOTS COLLECTION BIN.

334
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,850
WELL, THAT'S AWFULLY CONVENIENT, DON'T YOU THINK?

335
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,351
FOR THE TOTS IT IS.

336
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,355
HEY, YOU GUYS, GUESS WHAT?

337
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,857
WHAT? DID YOU FIND THEM?

338
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,859
NO. GUNTHER FAINTED.

339
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,866
MAN, THIS SUCKS.

340
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,868
IF MOM AND DAD DON'T SEE US ON TV

341
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,369
AFTER WE MADE THEM SO JEALOUS

342
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,871
WHO'S GOING TO BE THE LOSERS THEN?

343
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,376
HEY, I KNOW WHAT WILL  GET US UP ON A PLATFORM.

344
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,377
WHAT?

345
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,880
THE ROUTINE.

346
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,884
ROSS, WE HAVEN'T DONE THE ROUTINE SINCE MIDDLE SCHOOL.

347
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,887
HEY, WHEN THE SNIPPY GUY SEES THE ROUTINE

348
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,389
HE'LL WANT TO BUILD  US OUR OWN PLATFORM.

349
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,891
WAS IT REALLY THAT GOOD?

350
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,392
WE GOT HONORABLE MENTION

351
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,895
IN THE BROTHER/SIS TER DANCE CATEGORY.

352
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,897
LOOK, IT'S ALMOST FAKE MIDNIGHT.

353
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,899
DO WE REALLY HAVE ANY OTHER CHOICE?

354
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,402
OKAY, LET'S DO IT.

355
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,905
MOM AND DAD ARE GOING TO BE SO FACED.

356
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,414
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.

357
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,958
SO, DO WE REALLY NEED TO ASK

358
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,961
WHO'S GOING UP ON THE PLATFORM NEXT?

359
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,962
OH, NO.

360
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,464
GET UP THERE AND DO THAT AGAIN EXACTLY LIKE THAT.

361
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,465
YEAH!

362
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,468
MAKE SURE AND GET THIS.

363
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,471
DICK WILL WANT IT FOR THE BLOOPERS SHOW.

364
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,472
ALL RIGHT, CUT.

365
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:14,974
LISTEN UP, EVERYONE.

366
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,975
WHEN WE START AGAIN

367
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,477
IT'S GOING TO BE THE COUNTDOWN TO NEW YEAR'S

368
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,480
SO I WANT TO SEE EVERYBODY'S EXCITEMENT.

369
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,983
HEY, GUY, YOU'VE GOT ABOUT THREE SECONDS

370
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,484
TO GET AWAY FROM MY PARTNER.

371
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,986
WHAT'S GOING ON OVER HERE?

372
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,488
TAKE A LOOK AT THE GUY'S PANTS, HUH?

373
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,490
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU TOLD US TO SHOW EXCITEMENT

374
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,993
BUT DON'T YOU THINK HE WENT A LITTLE OVERBOARD.

375
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,996
WHAT'S THE MAT TER WITH YOU?

376
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,997
GET OUT OF HERE.

377
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,498
YEAH, TAKE A HIKE, WET PANTS.

378
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,502
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

379
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,504
WE'RE GOING TO  BE ON THE PLATFORM

380
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,006
FOR THE MILLENNIAL MOMENT.

381
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,007
I KNOW.

382
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,508
HEY, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PRACTICING

383
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,509
THE ROUTINE, HAVE YOU?

384
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,011
NO.

385
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,014
ME, TOO.

386
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,516
HEY, WHEN THE MUSIC STARTS UP AGAIN

387
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,020
I WAS THINKING ABOUT MAYBE GOING INTO THE ROBOT, YOU KNOW.

388
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,525
ROSS, I THINK WE SHOULD STICK TO THE ROUTINE.

389
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,027
WE DON'T WANT TO LOOK STUPID.

390
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,030
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE BACK.

391
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,531
TEN SECONDS LEFT. HERE WE GO.

392
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,532
TEN...

393
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,533
 NINE...

394
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,035
EIGHT...

395
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,036
SEVEN...

396
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,037
 OKAY...

397
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,538
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS.

398
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,541
WHATEVER HAPPENS, HAPPENS.

399
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,044
DESTINY.

400
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,045
THREE...

401
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,046
TWO...

402
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,547
ONE...

403
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,048
CUT!

404
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,549
NO!

405
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,553
YEAR!

406
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,056
HAPPY NO YEAR.

407
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,560
OKAY, HERE'S WHERE WE GO TO THE LIVE SHOT OF TIMES SQUARE.

408
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,561
NICE WORK, EVERYONE.

409
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,064
THAT'S A WRAP.

410
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,569
HEY, WHAT DID THAT SNIPPY GUY SAY?

411
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,572
I THINK HE'S KICKING OUT ANYONE WHO'S NOT DANCING

412
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,575
SO JUST KEEP DANCING!

413
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,587

414
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,089
HEY, LOOK WHO I FOUND.

415
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,091
OH, HI, GUYS.

416
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,094
YOU KNOW, BIRDS HAVE A VERY GOOD SENSE OF DIRECTION.

417
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,595
I THOUGHT MAYBE THEY COULD HELP US FIND

418
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,097
WHERE THE PRESENTS ARE HIDDEN.

419
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,601
YES, IF THE PRESENTS ARE HIDDEN SOUTH FOR THE WINTER.

420
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,604
OR WE COULD JUST FOLLOW YOUR CLEVER JOKES.

421
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,606
ANY IDEAS? NO? DIDN'T THINK SO. OKAY!

422
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,608
COME ON, GUYS.

423
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,610
SHOW US WHERE THE PRESENTS ARE.

424
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,114
THE DUCK SEEMS TO THINK THAT MONICA GOT ME GARBAGE.

425
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,116
HMM, I WONDER WHAT I CAN GET MONICA

426
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,118
THAT'S AS GOOD AS GARBAGE?

427
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,620
HMM, HOW ABOUT MY "AZ"?

428
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,624

429
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,627
HEY, THIS IS HOLLOW.

430
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,628
WHAT?

431
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,130
THIS BENCH, IT'S HOLLOW.

432
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,132
I CAN'T BELIEVE I NEVER KNEW THAT.

433
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,635
OH! THE PRESENTS!

434
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,637
NO, DON'T LOOK DIRECTLY AT THEM.

435
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,640
WHAT?

436
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,642
ALL RIGHT, NO, WE COULD LOOK AT THEM.

437
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,644
OH, THIS ONE'S FOR ME.

438
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,146
THIS ONE'S FOR CHANDLER.

439
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,147
ALL RIGHT.

440
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,149
AND THE BIG ONE'S FOR ME.

441
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,650
LET'S OPEN THEM.

442
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,651
OKAY, OKAY.

443
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,653
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

444
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,654
WE CAN'T DO THIS.

445
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,156
WHY? WHY?

446
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,158
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT MONICA GOT ME, YOU KNOW?

447
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,660
I MEAN, LOOK, I'M SURE SHE WORKED REALLY HARD

448
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,163
AT GETTING ME A PRESENT AND WANTING TO SURPRISE ME

449
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,165
AND YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO RUIN THAT.

450
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,167
LOOK, WE HAVE TO PUT THESE BACK.

451
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,169
THIS IS NOT WHAT CHRISTMAS IS ABOUT.

452
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,670
WHATEVER, LINUS.

453
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,672
I'M OPENING MINE.

454
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,177
NOBODY IS OPENING ANYTHING, OKAY?

455
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,679
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS

456
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,182
BUT I WANT TO SEE THE LOOK ON MONICA'S FACE

457
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,683
WHEN I GIVE HER MY PRESENT.

458
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,686
AND I'M SURE SHE WANTS TO SEE THE LOOK ON MY FACE

459
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,687
WHEN I GET MINE.

460
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,189
SO, PLEASE, PLEASE, CAN WE JUST...

461
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,690
CAN WE PUT THEM BACK?

462
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,692
WILL YOU GET US BETTER GIFTS?

463
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,195
FINE.

464
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,696
HEY, GUYS.

465
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,201
YOU FOUND THE PRESENTS?

466
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,703
CHANDLER, YOU LET THEM FIND THE PRESENTS?

467
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,205
GREAT.

468
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,208
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TOOK ME TO FIND YOU THAT WATER PURIFIER?

469
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,211
THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT ME?

470
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,713
OH, YES, I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN. THAT LOOK IS PRICELESS.

471
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,722
HOME SWEET HOME, HUH?

472
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,226
NICE TO GET BACK TO REALITY.

473
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,729
PLUS, WE KNOW  HOW THE NEW YEAR'S

474
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,231
GOING TO GO OFF.

475
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,732
I GUESS THERE'S NO REASON

476
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,235
FOR ALL THAT Y2K PANIC, YOU KNOW.

477
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,738
ANYWAY, GOOD NIGHT.

478
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,740
JOEY.

479
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,242
YEAH?

480
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,744
THREE...

481
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,747
TWO... ONE.

482
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,756
HAPPY NEW YEAR.

483
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,758

484
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,760

485
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,263
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

486
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,764
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

487
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,266
TONIGHT WHEN THEY YELLED CUT

488
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,767
AND WE DIDN'T GET TO KISS

489
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,769
I WAS REALLY, REALLY DISAPPOINTED.

490
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,271
AND I JUST...

491
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,773
I JUST REALLY WANTED TO KISS YOU.

492
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,276
REALLY?

493
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,277
IN THE MOMENT

494
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,779
I REALLY WANTED TO KISS YOU, TOO.

495
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,281
IN THE MOMENT.

496
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,282
IN THE MOMENT, HUH?

497
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,783
BUT ONLY IN THE MOMENT.

498
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,287
SO, DO YOU...

499
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,290
WANT TO KISS AGAIN?

500
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,294
SURE. NEW YEAR'S EVE IS ONLY TWO WEEKS AWAY.

501
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,795
CAN YOU WAIT?

502
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,797
NO.

503
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,800
ME NEITHER.

504
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,306
THREE... TWO...

505
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,309
JOEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO COUNTDOWN

506
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,311
EVERY TIME WE KISS.

507
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,812
OKAY.

508
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,315
EXCEPT THAT I SORT OF FELT LIKE I NEEDED

509
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,816
A COUPLE SECONDS TO GET READY.

510
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:06,325
?? FOR AULD LANG SYNE ??

511
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:13,832
?? WE'LL TAKE A CUP OF KINDNESS YET ??

512
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:19,838
?? FOR AULD LANG SYNE. ??

513
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,341
WE WERE ON THE PLATFORM

514
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,844
READY TO DANCE THE WORLD INTO THE NEW MILLENNIUM

515
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,346
AND THE GUY YELLS "CUT."

516
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,848
OH, SO, JOEY DIDN'T GET TO KISS JANINE?

517
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:33,352
NOPE, HE SURE DIDN'T.

518
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,855
WOW. SO, THEN I GUESS THAT MEANS THAT YOU GUYS ARE STILL TIED.

519
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,857
OH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

520
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,360
I THINK SHE SAW US DO OUR ROUTINE.

521
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,361
YEAH.

522
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,364
I MAY HAVE BOOGIED RIGHT INTO FIRST PLACE.

523
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,866
WAIT A MINUTE, SO YOU GUYS ARE TELLING ME

524
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:52,371
THAT YOU ACTUALLY DID THE ROUTINE FROM EIGHTH GRADE?

525
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,872
YEAH.

526
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,375
BUT OF COURSE WE HAD TO UPDATE IT A LITTLE BIT.

527
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,379
HEY, BY THE WAY, QUICK THINKING ABOUT CATCHING ME.

528
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,880
YEAH, BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO SAY

529
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,383
THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD HAVE DONE THE END

530
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,884
THE WAY YOU GUYS DID IT BACK THEN.

531
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,886
WHAT?

532
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,389
WE COULD DO IT.

533
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,392
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, YOU WERE A LOT BIGGER...

534
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,894
I MEAN, STRONGER BACK THEN.

535
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,398
I CAN DO IT, OKAY.

536
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,401
COME ON, LET'S GO. COME ON.

537
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,404
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE...

538
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,407
 SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.

539
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,909
I CAN'T DO IT!

540
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,413
NOW, YOU DO THAT, YOU'RE ON TV.
