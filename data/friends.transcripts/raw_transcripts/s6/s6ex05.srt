1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,006
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT YOU DIDN'T TELL ME

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,007
WE ARE STILL MARRIED.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,009
LOOK, I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU.

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,012
WHEN? AFTER THE BIRTH OF OUR FIRST SECRET CHILD?

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,013
ROSS DIDN't

6
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,014
GET THE ANNULMENT.

7
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,515
WE ARE STILL MARRIED.

8
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:16,516
WHAT?

9
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,518
OH, MY GOD!

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,521
ROSS?

11
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,523
OKAY, MAYBE IT WASN'T MY BEST DECISION

12
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,026
BUT I JUST COULDN'T FACE ANOTHER FAILED MARRIAGE.

13
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,027
LET ME JUST JUMP IN AND ASK.

14
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,528
AT WHAT POINT DID YOU THINK

15
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,030
THIS WAS A SUCCESSFUL MARRIAGE?

16
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,033
RACH, COME ON.

17
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:37,037
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF FUNNY.

18
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,541
MAYBE IT'S BEST NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT.

19
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,044
THIS IS INEXCUSABLE.

20
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,546
I AM SHOCKED TO MY VERY CORE.

21
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,550
PHOEBE, I TOLD HER YOU ALREADY KNEW.

22
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,055
ANOTHER LIE.

23
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,556
YOU HAVE A SICKNESS.

24
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,061
ROSS, JUST FOR MY OWN PEACE OF MIND

25
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,562
YOU'RE NOT MARRIED

26
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,064
TO ANY MORE OF US, ARE YOU?

27
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,566
LOOK, RACH, I I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU.

28
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,070
I JUST WANTED TO DO IT, UM, YOU KNOW, MY OWN WAY.

29
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,572
AH, YES. SILENTLY, WITH NO WORDS.

30
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,074
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY...

31
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,575
HEY!

32
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,077
HEY.

33
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:21,581
LOOK, IN ROSS' DEFENSE, OKAY...

43
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,227
YO, HEY, SOMEONE LEFT THEIR KEYS.

44
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,729
OOH! TO A PORSCHE, HUH?

45
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,232
HEY, GUNTHER, THESE YOURS?

46
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,234
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I DRIVE.

47
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,237
I MAKE FOUR BUCKS AN HOUR.

48
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,139
I SAVED UP FOR 350 YEARS.

49
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,642
NUH UH...

50
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:26,646
HEY, DID ANYBODY LOSE THEIR KEYS?

51
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,648
JOEY, WHY DON'T YOU PUT THEM

52
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,649
IN THE LOST AND FOUND?

53
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,151
THERE'S A LOST AND FOUND?

54
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,153
MY SHOE!

55
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,656
YOU LEFT A SHOE HERE?

56
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,658
WELL, I DIDN'T REALIZE TILL I GOT HOME.

57
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,660
I WASN'T GOING TO WALK ALL THE WAY

58
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,162
BACK DOWN HERE WITH ONE SHOE.

59
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,164
I'M GOING TO GO FIND THAT GUY'S CAR

60
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,166
AND LEAVE A NOTE ON THE WINDSHIELD.

61
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,667
WHEN HE COMES BACK FOR HIS KEYS

62
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,669
I'LL BE SURE TO GIVE HIM YOUR SHOE.

63
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,171
GREAT. THANKS.

64
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,673
OH, GOOD, GOOD.

65
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,674
YOU GUYS ARE HERE.

66
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,176
LISTEN.

67
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,677
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEND TOMORROW

68
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,680
TAKING CARE OF THREE INCREDIBLY CUTE LITTLE PUPPIES?

69
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,682
MY GOD! WHAT A FUN DAY.

70
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,184
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

71
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,685
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

72
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,688
OKAY. WELL, I'LL BRING THEM BY TOMORROW MORNING.

73
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,191
OKAY, AND, UM... BY THE WAY, THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY PUPPIES.

74
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,692
THEY'RE FRANK AND ALICE'S TRIPLETS.

75
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,693
OKAY, SEE YA.

76
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,196
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! WHAT?

77
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,198
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, OH, PLEASE.

78
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,699
FRANK AND ALICE ASKED ME

79
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,701
TO BABY SIT THE TRIPLETS, AND I'M NERVOUS

80
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,203
CAUSE I'VE NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE BY MYSELF.

81
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,705
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. WE'LL ABSOLUTELY DO IT.

82
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,207
YEAH, I'M GOING TO PASS

83
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,209
BECAUSE I WAS KIND OF IFFY WHEN IT WAS PUPPIES.

84
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,212
COME ON, CHANDLER, COME ON.

85
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,714
IT WILL GIVE US GREAT PRACTICE FOR WHEN...

86
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,218
PEOPLE WITH BABIES COME TO VISIT.

87
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,720
  IT'S THE WRONG CAR!

88
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,728
SO, I STILL HAVE BOXES HERE

89
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:52,232
I STILL HAVE BOXES AT ROSS'

90
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,234
AND I HAVE NOWHERE TO LIVE.

91
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,237
WOW, I CAN SO EASILY FREAK OUT RIGHT NOW.

92
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,738
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT ME?

93
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,241
I JUST FOUND OUT DENISE IS LEAVING TOWN FOR A WHILE.

94
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,742
I DON'T HAVE A ROOMMATE.

95
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,247
WELL, MAYBE...

96
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,749
MAYBE I CAN BE YOUR ROOMMATE, PHEEBS.

97
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,253
MAYBE YOU COULD BE MY ROOMMATE.

98
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,255
WELL, THERE'S AN IDEA.

99
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,756
YEAH!

100
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,757
THAT WOULD BE GREAT!

101
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,259
WAIT. HOW LONG IS DENISE GONE FOR?

102
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,262
UM... SHE SAID SHE'D BE BACK DECEMBER 26.

103
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,763
OH, DECEMBER 26.

104
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,765
HA! MAYBE SHE'S SANTA CLAUS.

105
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,773
OH, LOOK WHO IT IS.

106
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,774
MY HUSBAND.

107
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,776
THE APPLE OF MY EYE.

108
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,778
OKAY, I GOT US A COURT DATE

109
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,780
FOR TOMORROW AT 2:00

110
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,782
AND I PICKED UP ALL THE FORMS.

111
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,784
I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.

112
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,286
WELL, SURE.

113
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,288
IF YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING

114
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,789
I HAVE NO REASON TO DOUBT YOU.

115
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,790
GIVE ME THOSE FORMS.

116
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,793
ALL RIGHT, NOW, I'M GOING TO DO THIS MY WAY

117
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,295
AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR A PEEP OUT OF YOU.

118
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,296
OKAY, RACH, BUT...

119
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,298
AH! YOU'RE PEEPING.

120
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,302

121
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,303
ROSS, YOU KNOW WHAT?

122
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,304
I JUST GOT...

123
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,806
WHY? WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

124
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,308
LOOK, I TOLD YOU I...

125
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,809
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THREE FAILED MARRIAGES.

126
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,811
LOOK, IF YOU'D HAD TWO FAILED MARRIAGES

127
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:12,812
YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

128
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,314
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

129
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,315
THANKS TO YOU

130
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,317
I'M HALFWAY THERE.

131
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,321
OH! OH, I  AM SO MAD, ROSS.

132
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,323
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER BEEN THIS ANGRY.

133
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,826
WHAT ABOUT THE TIME I SAID WE WERE ON A BREAK?

134
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,328
OH!

135
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,850
HO, HO, HO!

136
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,352
NICE CAR.

137
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,854
YEAH, IT'S, UH, IT'S NOT MINE.

138
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,357
I LOVE YOUR CAR.

139
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,859
YEAH, IT'S... MINE.

140
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,362
I BET IT'S FAST.

141
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,863
ME, TOO. YEAH.

142
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,365
AND COMFORTABLE.

143
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,368
DO YOU, UH, DO YOU LIKE LEATHER SEATS?

144
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,369
YEAH.

145
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,872
IT'S GOT THEM

146
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,878
PHEEB, HOW'S IT GOING?

147
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,879
I'M DOING OKAY.

148
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,381
I THINK IT'S GOING WELL.

149
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,882
DO YOU THINK THEY'RE HAVING FUN? AM I TALKING TOO FAST?

150
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,384
NO. SOUND LIKE ME.

151
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,386
PHEEBS, IT'S GOING GREAT.

152
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,888
LOOK AT CHANDLER WITH LITTLE BABY GIRL CHANDLER.

153
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,890
LITTLE BABY GIRL CHANDLER?

154
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,393
WHERE HAVE I HEARD THAT BEFORE?

155
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,894
OH, RIGHT-- COACH RUBIN.

156
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,396
OOH!

157
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,900
YOU KNOW WHAT, PHEEBS?

158
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,402
WHEN YOU'RE DONE OVER THERE

159
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,405
WE'VE GOT A KIND OF SITUATION OVER HERE, TOO.

160
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,406
UH UH. NO.

161
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,408
WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR OWN BABIES.

162
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,910
SEE, THAT'S WHERE I THINK THAT YOU'RE WRONG.

163
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,912
WE'VE BEEN PLAYING THESE BABIES MAN TO MAN.

164
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,914
WE SHOULD REALLY BE PLAYING A ZONE DEFENSE.

165
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,416
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

166
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,417
I JUST THINK

167
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,418
THINGS WILL GO A LOT SMOOTHER

168
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,919
IF WE EACH HAVE OUR OWN ZONE.

169
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,921
PHOEBE, YOU CAN BE IN CHARGE OF WIPING.

170
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,922
AND, YOU KNOW, MON

171
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,924
YOU CAN BE IN CHARGE OF DIAPERING.

172
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,427
AND I CAN BE IN CHARGE OF LOOKING HOW CUTE THEY ARE

173
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,429
WHEN THEY PUT THEIR HANDS AROUND...

174
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,432
THAT SOUNDS REALLY GREAT.

175
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,933
MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE IN CHARGE OF WIPING.

176
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,435
OKAY, I'M A ROOKIE.

177
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,437
I SHOULD NOT BE IN THE END ZONE.

178
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,948
 THIS IS SO GREAT.

179
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,951
THIS IS EXACTLY HOW WE SET THE PLATES AT THE RESTAURANT.

180
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,453
OH, YEAH?

181
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,455
WELL, THIS IS NOT WHAT I ORDERED.

182
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,960
HEY, GUYS. HI. HEY.

183
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,961
HEY, BABIES.

184
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,463
OH, I'M HAVING

185
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,964
THE BEST MORNING.

186
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,466
THAT PORSCHE I'VE GOT THE KEYS TO--

187
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,967
IT'S STILL THERE.

188
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,970
SHOCKING, SINCE YOU STILL HAVE THE KEYS.

189
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,475
YOU SHOULD SEE THE TREATMENT I GET WHEN I'M WITH THAT CAR.

190
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,477
PEOPLE ARE FRIENDLY, THEY WANT TO TALK

191
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,978
AND NOT JUST ABOUT THE CAR.

192
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,981
ONE GUY GAVE ME ADVICE ABOUT MY EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

193
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:02,982
WHAT EQUITY INVESTMENTS?

194
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,485
THE ONES THAT GOT ME THE PORSCHE.

195
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,986
WILL YOU KEEP UP?

196
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,492
BUT I FIGURED IF PEOPLE KEEP SEEING ME JUST STANDING THERE

197
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,494
THEY'RE GOING TO START TO THINK I DON'T OWN IT

198
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,995
SO, I FIGURED I'LL WASH IT, RIGHT?

199
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,498
MONICA, YOU GOT A BUCKET AND SOME SOAP I CAN BORROW?

200
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:19,999
OH, YEAH.

201
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,502
I GOT SOAP AND SPONGES AND RAGS

202
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,005
AND CARNUBA WAX AND POLISHING COMPOUND.

203
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,508
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A CAR.

204
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,010
I KNOW, BUT ONE TIME THERE WAS THIS REALLY DIRTY CAR

205
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,012
PARKED IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING, SO I WASHED IT.

206
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,014
AND?

207
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,016
AND SIX OTHERS.

208
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,518
THERE YOU ARE.

209
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,523
YEAH, SHE TOPS OUT AT 130.

210
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,524
WOW.

211
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,025
AND THAT'S JUST

212
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,026
IN THE CITY.

213
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,028
I GET HER UP TO 160 WHEN I TAKE HER UPSTATE.

214
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,029
REALLY?

215
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,531
YOU GOT A PLACE UPSTATE?

216
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,533
SURE.

217
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,035
ER. WELL, I'LL SEE YOU LAT

218
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,037
OKAY. TAKE IT EASY.

219
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,542
HEY, THAT'S MY CAR.

220
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,043
REALLY? OH. UH...

221
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,546
JUST GIVE ME FIVE MORE MINUTES, WILL YOU?

222
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,548
WHAT... WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

223
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,550
OH, I... I FOUND THE KEYS

224
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,052
AND NOW I'M JUST POLISHING HER UP.

225
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,054
BUT IT'S MY CAR.

226
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,556
YEAH, BUT IT'S MY WAX.

227
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:21,060
LISTEN, I DON'T COME TO THE CITY MUCH

228
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,562
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE CRAZY

229
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,564
OR IF THIS IS SOME KIND OF STREET THEATER...

230
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,065
BUT COULD

231
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,567
I HAVE MY KEYS?

232
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,568
SURE. HERE.

233
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,570
I'LL SAVE YOU A PARKING SPOT.

234
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,071
I'M NOT COMING BACK.

235
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,573
WHY NOT?

236
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,574
I LIVE UPSTATE.

237
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,076
YEAH, SO DID I.

238
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,580
I DON'T KNOW WHY I WAS SO NERVOUS ABOUT THIS.

239
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,583
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY FRANK AND ALICE ARE ALWAYS COMPLAINING.

240
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,584
THIS IS SO EASY.

241
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,587
YEAH, TWO HOURS, A LIFETIME-- THAT'S THE SAME.

242
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,591
CHECK IT OUT. CHECK IT OUT.

243
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,595
WHEN THE BABIES WAKE UP, THEY CAN MEET KROG.

244
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,096
CHANDLER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

245
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,098
THAT THING COULD PUT SOMEONE'S EYE OUT.

246
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,100
HE CAN DO MORE THAN THAT.

247
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,102
HE CAN DESTROY THE UNIVERSE.

248
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,105
NO. CHANDLER, THEY COULD SWALLOW ONE OF THOSE LITTLE PARTS.

249
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,607
AND ALSO, LOOK AT HIS SMOOTH AREA--

250
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,609
THAT'S JUST GOING TO MESS THEM UP.

251
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,613
IT'S JUST NOT AN APPROPRIATE TOY FOR ONE YEAR OLDS.

252
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,114
OR 30 YEAR OLDS.

253
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,616
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SWALLOW ANYTHING.

254
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,618
YOU GUYS ARE BEING WAY TOO OVER PROTECTIVE.

255
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,620
WHEN I WAS A KID, MY MOM USED TO JUST THROW ME

256
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,121
INTO A PILE OF BROKEN GLASS.

257
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,623
WHAT?

258
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,625
GLASS, SAND, WHATEVER.

259
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,130
OH, LOOK AT LITTLE LESLIE STRETCHING IN HER SLEEP.

260
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,632
OH, IT'S SO CUTE.

261
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,134
I WONDER WHAT AGE IT IS THAT YOU STOP BEING ABLE

262
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,136
TO PUT BOTH LEGS BEHIND YOUR HEAD?

263
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,638
OH, I CAN STILL DO THAT.

264
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,139
HOW ARE YOU  STILL SINGLE?

265
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,142
ALL RIGHT.

266
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,645
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

267
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,647
MAYBE KROG IS NOT A SAFE TOY.

268
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,148
GOOD. WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

269
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,150
I SWALLOWED HIS SONIC BLASTER GUN.

270
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,151
 WHAT?

271
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,653
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

272
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,155
WELL, I WAS TRYING TO PROVE THAT I WAS RIGHT.

273
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,156
YOU KNOW, AND

274
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,658
IT TURNS OUT I WAS WRONG

275
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:03,162
AND... NOW IT'S LODGED IN MY THROAT.

276
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,667
DAMN IT. YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE TIME

277
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,169
WE WERE CONCENTRATING ON THE BABIES

278
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,171
AND NO ONE WAS WATCHING CHANDLER.

279
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,174

280
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,677
OKAY, YOU TWO ARE ASKING THE COURT FOR AN ANNULMENT?

281
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,178
YES, YOUR HONOR

282
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,681
AND HERE ARE OUR FORMS, ALL FILLED OUT.

283
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,182
SO, BASED  ON YOUR PETITION

284
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,185
YOU ARE SEEKING AN ANNULMENT ON THE GROUNDS

285
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,188
THAT MR. GELLER IS MENTALLY UNSTABLE?

286
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:36,195
FINE. I'M MENTALLY UNSTABLE.

287
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,697
AND BASED ON THE FACT THAT MR. GELLER

288
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,198
IS AN INTRAVENOUS DRUG USER?

289
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,200
WHAT?

290
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,703
UH, YES, HEROIN AND CRACK.

291
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,207
CRACK ISN'T EVEN AN INTRAVENOUS DRUG.

292
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,709
WELL, YOU WOULD KNOW.

293
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,213
NOW, IT ALSO SAYS HERE THAT YOU, UM

294
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,216
LIED ABOUT YOUR SEXUAL PREFERENCE BEFORE MARRIAGE.

295
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,718
OH, COME ON.

296
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,220
ROSS, PLEASE. I FOUND THE MAGAZINES.

297
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,224
AND FINALLY, THAT YOU WERE UNABLE

298
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,726
TO CONSUMMATE THE MARRIAGE.

299
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,727
WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE

300
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,729
SINCE YOU'RE GAY AND ADDICTED TO HEROIN.

301
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,231
OKAY, YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY...

302
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,733
THIS IS INSANE.

303
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,736
I'M NOT ADDICTED TO HEROIN.

304
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,738
I'M NOT GAY AND THERE IS NO PROBLEM

305
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,740
WITH MY ABILITY TO CONSUMMATE ANYTHING.

306
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,244
LOOK, I'LL CONSUMMATE THIS MARRIAGE RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

307
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,748
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

308
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,250
AND WHEN WE WERE DATING, WE CONSUMMATED LIKE BUNNIES.

309
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,252
AH!

310
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,755
NOW, IF YOU TWO WERE INVOLVED IN A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP

311
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,757
THAT REALLY CREATES A PROBLEM.

312
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,758
YOUR HONOR, REST ASSURED

313
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,260
THAT RELATIONSHIP ENDED TWO YEARS AGO

314
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,262
AND CAN YOU PLEASE STRIKE "CONSUMMATED LIKE BUNNIES"

315
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,263
FROM THE RECORD?

316
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,766
IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS RECORD

317
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,768
THAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE?

318
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,271
WELL, YES, WE GOT MARRIED IN VEGAS

319
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,274
AND, UH... THE NAMES, I THINK.

320
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,777
THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE LEGAL SYSTEM WORKS.

321
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,279
THIS PROCESS IS BASED ON AN OBJECTIVE REVIEW

322
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,281
OF THE FACTS, NOT OF THE LIES.

323
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,783
OBJECTION!

324
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,285
IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT EITHER.

325
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,787
OVERRULED.

326
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,288
OH, STOP IT.

327
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,290
WELL, BASED ON WHAT I'VE HEARD

328
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,293
YOU TWO CERTAINLY DON'T QUALIFY FOR AN ANNULMENT.

329
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,294
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TOGETHER

330
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,296
YOU'LL HAVE TO FILE FOR DIVORCE.

331
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,298
THAT'S GREAT. YOU HAPPY NOW?

332
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,301
LOOK WHAT YOU DID WITH YOUR FUNNY, FUNNY FORM.

333
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,302
WHAT? ME?

334
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,804
WHAT ABOUT YOU

335
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,806
AND YOUR "CONSUMMATED LIKE BUNNIES" NONSENSE?

336
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,807
IT WAS...

337
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,809
WHAT ARE YOU TYPING THAT FOR?

338
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,812
SHE ALREADY SAID WE DON'T GET THE ANNULMENT.

339
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,814
DON'T TYPE THAT.

340
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,315
STOP TYPING.

341
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,818
HEY. STOP TYPING.

342
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,820
STOP TYPING! STOP TYPING!

343
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,822
OKAY. OKAY. DO YOU SEE?

344
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,826
DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU'RE KEEPING ME MARRIED TO?

345
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,828
YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF MY CHAMBERS.

346
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,830
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, LADY, HERE IS THE DEAL:

347
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,331
I CAME HERE FOR AN ANNULMENT

348
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,333
AND I AM NOT LEAVING H ERE UNTIL I GET ONE.

349
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,335
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN JAIL?

350
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,838
OKAY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

351
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,346

352
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,351

353
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,353

354
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,362
SO THAT PORSCHE GUY TOOK HIS CAR BACK.

355
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,368
BUT YOU FOUND THE KEYS TO HIS CLOTHES?

356
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,369
NO. I JUST, UH...

357
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,371
I JUST LOVE THE WAY IT FEELS

358
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,874
WHEN EVERYBODY THINKS I OWN A PORSCHE.

359
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,877
AND PEOPLE WILL THINK YOU OWN A PORSCHE

360
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,378
BECAUSE YOU'RE WEARING THE CLOTHES?

361
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,880
OF COURSE.

362
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,381
ONLY AN IDIOT WOULD WEAR THIS STUFF

363
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,883
IF HE DIDN'T HAVE THE CAR.

364
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,888
THAT IS TRUE.

365
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,892
YEAH, BUT ONLY A GENIUS WOULD SWALLOW A SONIC BLASTER GUN.

366
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,894
OH, I'VE BEEN THERE.

367
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:00,399
WELL, I AM GOING TO GO DRIVE MY PORSCHE.

368
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,402
JOEY, YOU KNOW YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ONE.

369
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,904
COME ON. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

370
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:05,905
I'M IN CHARACTER.

371
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,406
WILL YOU TALK TO HER?

372
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,909
AH, I THINK IT JUST MOVED.

373
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,410
IT'S REALLY POKING ME.

374
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,411
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

375
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,913
WE'RE GOING TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

376
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,415
WHAT? NO, YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME HERE WITH THEM.

377
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,416
WE'RE BABY SITTING.

378
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,417
THE BABIES ARE ASLEEP.

379
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,419
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE OKAY ON YOUR OWN FOR A WHILE.

380
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,921
BUT YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME WITH THEM.

381
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,923
WE'RE A TEAM. WE'RE PLAYING A ZONE.

382
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,424
THEY'RE GOING TO TRIPLE TEAM ME.

383
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,427
HE'S GOT SOMETHING PLASTIC LODGED INTO HIS THROAT.

384
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,929
WE'VE GOT TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

385
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,932
BUT, NO, BECAUSE A DOCTOR WON'T BE ABLE TO HELP HIM.

386
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,433
IT'S JUST GOING TO, YOU KNOW

387
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,937
NATURALLY PASS THROUGH HIS SYSTEM IN, LIKE, SEVEN YEARS.

388
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,939
I THINK THAT'S GUM.

389
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,941
I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S GUN.

390
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,444
OKAY, LISTEN, THIS REALLY HURTS. LET'S GO.

391
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,949
BUT NO, A REAL MAN WOULDN'T JUST RUN TO THE HOSPITAL.

392
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,951
NO... WHAT WOULD KROG DO?

393
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:58,958
OH, WHY ISN'T THAT VALET BACK WITH MY PORSCHE?

394
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,961
MAYBE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THE KEYS.

395
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,965
PORSCHE.

396
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,468
THAT WAS TOTALLY YOUR FAULT.

397
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,469
MY FAULT?

398
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,971
YOU THREATENED THE JUDGE.

399
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:12,972
WELL, YOU RIPPED THE PAPER

400
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,974
OUT OF THE COURT REPORTER'S MACHINE.

401
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,476
THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY I COULD GET HIM TO STOP TYPING!

402
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,477
OH.

403
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,980
HI. HOW ARE THE GELLERS?

404
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,987
DON'T CALL US THAT.

405
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,991
THE JUDGE WOULDN'T LET US GET AN ANNULMENT.

406
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,993
NOW WE GOT TO GET A DIVORCE!

407
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,495
DID A PORSCHE THROW UP ON YOU?

408
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,501
HEY, THAT'S PORSCH AH!

409
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:47,006
LOOK AT ME TAKING CARE OF YOU WITH NO PROBLEM, HUH?

410
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,008
YOU GUYS FEEL SAFE, RIGHT?

411
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,511
OKAY, I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT SPIT BUBBLE AS A "YEAH, I DO."

412
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,513
OKAY, LET'S GET RID OF THIS DIRTY DIAPER, LESLIE.

413
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,516
I'LL SET YOU UP WITH A NICE CLEAN ONE.

414
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,018
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

415
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,020
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU.

416
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,522
I JUST HAVE TO CLEAN THAT UP, OKAY?

417
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,525
BECAUSE, LET'S FACE IT, WE'RE AT MONICA'S.

418
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,526
OKAY. I BROKE IT.

419
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,030
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THAT'S JUST THE WAY THINGS GO.

420
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,533
OKAY. GOOD.

421
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,035
WHY ARE THERE ONLY TWO OF YOU?

422
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,536
WHERE'S LESLIE?

423
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,538
WELL, YOU CAN'T ANSWER.

424
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,541
LESLIE, WHERE ARE YOU, LESLIE?

425
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,544
LESLIE, NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME FOR YOUR FIRST WORDS.

426
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,046

427
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,548
WELL, LOOK AT YOU.

428
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,051
HEY...

429
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,054
YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT MISCHIEVOUS.

430
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,055
MY GOSH.

431
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,557
OH, YOU'RE A LOT MISCHIEVOUS.

432
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,558
WELL, IT'LL DRY.

433
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,061
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO PLAY.

434
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,064
YOU SIT WITH YOUR BROTHER AND SISTER NOW

435
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,566
WHO AREN'T THERE.

436
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,080
HI.

437
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,082
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

438
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,583
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY THAT KROG

439
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,085
WILL BE FULLY EQUIPPED

440
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,088
TO DESTROY THE UNIVERSE AGAIN IN 12 TO 14 HOURS.

441
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,589
OKAY.

442
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,592
SO, I TOTALLY TOOK CARE OF THE BABIES ALL BY MYSELF.

443
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,594
I FED THEM, BATHED THEM AND PUT THEM TO BED.

444
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:19,098
AND PROTECTED THEM FROM A TORNADO?

445
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,602
OH, MY GOD.

446
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,605
I KNOW. THE BABIES ARE ASLEEP.

447
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,607
PHOEBE, WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

448
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,608
I DID IT.

449
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,111
I TOOK CARE OF THE BABIES ALL BY MYSELF.

450
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,612
B B BUT MY APARTMENT?

451
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,613
WAS THE SETTING

452
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,615
OF PHOEBE'S TRIUMPH.

453
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,118
BUT THE MESS...

454
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,619
IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS THE FACT

455
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,122
THAT PHOEBE TOOK CARE OF THE BABIES ALL BY HERSELF.

456
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,123
YOU'RE RIGHT.

457
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,125
YOU'RE RIGHT, I SHOULDN'T FREAK OUT

458
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,127
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE

459
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,628
WHEN YOU AND I HAVE BABIES.

460
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,629
WHEN WILL THAT BE?

461
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,634
PHOEBE, WOULD YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS MESS?

462
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,145
OH, HONEY, THANK GOD YOU'RE HOME.

463
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,646
I WAS GETTING WORRIED.

464
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,149
I PICKED UP THE DIVORCE PAPERS.

465
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,152
UH, I'VE ALREADY SIGNED EVERYTHING

466
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,655
AND I PUT LITTLE X's WHERE YOU NEED TO SIGN.

467
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,157
OH, LITTLE X's... GREAT.

468
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,658
THAT MAKES UP FOR EVERYTHING.

469
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:25,664
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF STUPID STUFF, TOO, OKAY?

470
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,667
OH, NAME ONE STUPID THING THAT IS AS STUPID AS THIS ONE.

471
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,170
OKAY, HOW ABOUT YOU FLEW TO LONDON TO STOP MY WEDDING.

472
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,671
UH, HOW ABOUT YOU TOLD ME YOU LOVED ME

473
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,173
AFTER I WAS ALREADY MARRIED.

474
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,174
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

475
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,675
THAT WAS DIFFERENT.

476
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,178
I DID THOSE THINGS BECAUSE I WAS IN LOVE WITH YOU.

477
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,180
YEAH, RIGHT.

478
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:46,185
YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT.

479
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,688
SO, LET'S... LET'S JUST SIGN THE PAPERS.

480
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,192
WHAT?

481
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,693
NOTHING.

482
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,197
OKAY, CAN WE JUST SIGN, PLEASE?

483
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,699
MM HMM.

484
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,211
CONGRATULATIONS.

485
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,212
OKAY, WAIT, ROSS.

486
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,213
WAIT A MINUTE. UM...

487
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,714
I, UH...

488
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,717
KIND OF HAVE A LITTLE CONFESSION.

489
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,219
WHAT?

490
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,223
UH, WELL, YOU KNOW THIS WHOLE MARRIAGE THING...

491
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,224
KIND OF MY IDEA.

492
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,227
EXCUSE ME?

493
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,728
UH, WELL, REMEMBER HOW WE WERE TOO DRUNK

494
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,231
TO REMEMBER ANYTHING THE NIGHT WE WERE MARRIED?

495
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,232
YEAH.

496
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,233
AND, UH...

497
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,735
YEAH, I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING

498
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,737
BUT IT JUST KEPT COMING BACK TO ME

499
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,739
AND, UM, REMEMBER WE WERE IN THE CASINO

500
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,741
AND FOR SOME REASON YOU THOUGHT

501
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,244
IT WOULD BE FUNNY TO EAT A LOT OF GRAPES?

502
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,246
AND, UH, AND I THOUGHT

503
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,749
IT WOULD BE FUNNIER IF WE GOT MARRIED.

504
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:55,254
SO, AS A COMPROMISE, WE DECIDED FIRST TO GET MARRIED

505
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,755
AND THEN...

506
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,758
 TO EAT A LOT OF GRAPES.

507
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:06,265
SO, UM, SORRY I GOT US INTO THIS WHOLE THING.

508
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,269
SO, THEN, I MEAN, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT

509
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,771
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

510
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:17,276
YEAH, DON'T PUSH IT THOUGH.

511
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:24,283
I GOT TO SAY, I KNOW I DIVORCE A LOT OF WOMEN.

512
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:30,289
NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE DIVORCING YOU.

513
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,290
I KNOW.

514
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,293
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IF YOU AND I GOT MARRIED

515
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,295
THAT WOULD BE THE ONE THAT STUCK.

516
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,297
AND IT WOULDN'T BE A SECRET.

517
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,301
AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE OUR WEDDING DINNER AT PIZZA HUT.

518
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:46,805
OH... DID I... DID I EVEN TREAT?

519
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,807
NO, IT WAS ON THE HOUSE.

520
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,809
IT WAS A NEWLYWED SPECIAL.

521
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,313
THAT MAY BE THE MOST DEPRESSING THING I'VE HEARD IN MY LIFE.

522
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,315
YEAH.

523
00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:00,319
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET THESE TO MY LAWYER'S OFFICE.

524
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,820
YEAH-- HEY, THANKS, ROSS

525
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,322
FOR TAKING CARE OF ALL THIS.

526
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,823
AH, NO PROBLEM.

527
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,835
I'M GOING TO NEED A COPY OF THOSE.

528
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,337
TOTALLY. YEAH.

529
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,847
HEY! HEY! CAREFUL AROUND MY PORSCHE.

530
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,349
HI, JOEY.

531
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,352
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

532
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,855
HE HAS THE MOST AMAZING PORSCHE UNDER THERE.

533
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,857
I'D LOVE TO SHOW YOU, BUT I JUST TUCKED HER IN.

534
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:39,858
SHE'S SLEEPING.

535
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,360

536
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,862
HEY, WOULD YOU TWO GIRLS LIKE TO GO FOR A DRINK?
