1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,506
WE'VE GOT THREE MINUTES TILL THE REACTOR BLOWS.

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,008
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO MAKE IT.

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,510
YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE!

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,511
SAVE YOURSELF.

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,514
NO, I WON'T LEAVE YOU.

6
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,516
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

7
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,018
I'M A ROBOT.

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,519
I'M JUST A MACHINE!

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,022
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

10
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,523
NOT TO ME.

11
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,524
OH, MY GOD.

12
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,525
WHAT?

13
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,028
I AM EXTREMELY TALENTED.

14
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,030
YEAH, YEAH, YOU'RE GREAT.

15
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,531
OKAY, LET'S TAKE IT FROM...

16
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,534
NO, I MEAN I WAS REALLY ACTING MY ASS OFF.

17
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,537
WELL, I THOUGHT I WAS PRETTY GOOD, TOO.

18
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,539
OH, YEAH, YOU'RE SOLID.

19
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,041
ME. YOU'RE JUST NO...

20
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,544
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH FOR NOW.

21
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,047
I DON'T WANT TO BE OVER REHEARSED.

22
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,050
FINE! I'LL DO IT WITHOUT YOU!

23
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,553
I DON'T NEED YOU OR ANYBODY ELSE!

24
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,056
I'M GOING TO MAKE IT ON MY OWN!

25
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,059
YOU'LL SEE!

26
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,560
YOU'LL ALL SEE!

36
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,602
SO, WHAT'S THIS THING YOU'RE AUDITIONING FOR?

37
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,104
OH, IT'S A NEW TV SHOW.

38
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,106
I'M UP FOR THE PART OF MAC MACHIAVELLI...

39
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,107
OR "MAC."

40
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,609
YEAH.

41
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,112
I'M A DETECTIVE, AND I SOLVE CRIMES

42
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,614
WITH THE HELP OF MY ROBOT PARTNER.

43
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,616
HE'S A COMPUTERIZED HUMANOID

44
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,619
ELECTRONICALLY ENHANCED SECRET ENFORCER.

45
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,622
OR "CHEESE."

46
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,126
SO, MAC AND CHEESE.

47
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,128
THAT'S THE TITLE.

48
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,629
YEAH.

49
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,131
YOU KNOW, THEY REALLY LUCKED OUT

50
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,632
THAT THE INITIALS SPELL "CHEESE."

51
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,135
THAT IS LUCKY.

52
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,136
HUH.

53
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,637
SO, JOEY, IF YOU GET THIS

54
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,141
YOU'RE GOING TO BE, LIKE, THE STAR OF YOUR OWN TV SHOW.

55
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,143
I MEAN, YOU'LL BE LIKE THE BIG CHEESE.

56
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,144
OR THE BIG MAC.

57
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,645
HEY, YOU LOVE THOSE.

58
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,147
WELL, DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP

59
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,149
BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

60
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,151
NOW, NOW, WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT, JOSEPH?

61
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,152
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

62
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,653
MY OWN TV SHOW?

63
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,155
I JUST... I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOOD ENOUGH.

64
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,657
I AM.

65
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,159
 JOEY

66
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,160
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

67
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,161
YOU'RE A TERRIFIC ACTOR.

68
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,163
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

69
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,165
HOW CAN YOU EVEN ASK THAT QUESTION?

70
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,667
WHOA, SHE'S PRETTY.

71
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,169
YEAH.

72
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,671
OH, AND SHE'S REALLY NICE, TOO.

73
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,673
SHE TAUGHT ME ALL ABOUT, YOU KNOW

74
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,175
HOW TO WORK WITH THE CAMERAS

75
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,676
AND "SMELL THE FART" ACTING.

76
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,677
HUH.

77
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,678
I'M SORRY...

78
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,680
WHAT? EXCUSE ME?

79
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,183
IT'S LIKE, YOU GOT SO MANY LINES

80
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,184
TO LEARN SO FAST

81
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,186
THAT SOMETIMES YOU NEED A MINUTE

82
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,188
TO REMEMBER YOUR NEXT ONE.

83
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,689
SO, WHILE YOU'RE THINKING OF IT

84
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,693
YOU TAKE THIS BIG PAUSE, WHERE YOU LOOK ALL INTENSE

85
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,694
YOU KNOW, LIKE THIS.

86
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,698
OK AY. MMM. OH.

87
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,699

88
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,702
OH, HERE'S MY SCENE! HERE'S MY SCENE!

89
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,703
Mrs. Wallace?

90
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,205
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray

91
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,706
your sister's neurosurgeon.

92
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,709
Your sister is suffering from a...

93
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,715
: YEAH, EVA...

94
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,719
WE'VE DONE SOME EXCELLENT WORK HERE

95
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,722
AND I WOULD HAVE TO SAY

96
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,726
YOUR PROBLEM IS QUITE CLEAR.

97
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,728

98
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:52,232
?? ALL YOU WANT IS A DINKLE ??

99
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,235
?? WHAT YOU ENVY'S A SCHWANG ??

100
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,738
?? A THING THROUGH WHICH YOU CAN TINKLE ??

101
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,741
?? OR PLAY WITH OR SIMPLY LET HANG. ??

102
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,744
I PLAY AL PACINO'S BUTT.

103
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,747
ALL RIGHT?

104
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,751
HE GOES INTO THE SHOWER, AND THEN I'M HIS BUTT.

105
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,253
OH, MY GOD.

106
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,254
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

107
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,756
THIS IS A REAL MOVIE, AND AL PACINO'S IN IT

108
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,757
AND THAT'S BIG.

109
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,259
OH, NO, IT'S TERRIFIC.

110
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,760
YOU DESERVE THIS.

111
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,761
AFTER ALL YOUR YEARS

112
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,264
OF STRUGGLING, YOU'VE FINALLY BEEN ABLE TO CRACK

113
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,266
YOUR WAY INTO SHOW BUSINESS.

114
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,769
OKAY, FINE. MAKE JOKES.

115
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:30,770
I DON'T CARE.

116
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,772
THIS IS A BIG BREAK FOR ME.

117
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,274
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT. IT IS.

118
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,278
SO, YOU GOING TO INVITE US ALL TO THE BIG OPENING?

119
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,281
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'M OUT OF HERE.

120
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,282
WISH ME LUCK.

121
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,284
?? GOOD LUCK, GOOD LUCK ??

122
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,787
?? WE ALL WISH YOU GOOD LUCK.??

123
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,791
YEAH, WHATEVER.

124
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,794
WOW.

125
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,796
IF I COULD DANCE, I'D BE A TRIPLE THREAT.

126
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,804
IT'S YOUR TURN.

127
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,307
OH, ARE WE PLAYING THIS?

128
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,309
HEY.

129
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,811
HEY. HOW DID THE AUDITION GO?

130
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,812
TERRIBLE.

131
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,813
I MESSED UP EVERY LINE.

132
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,315
I SHOULDN'T EVEN BE AN ACTOR.

133
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,816
WAIT A MINUTE.

134
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,817
ARE YOU DOING THAT THING

135
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,319
WHERE YOU PRETEND IT DIDN'T GO WELL

136
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,820
BUT IT REALLY DID GO WELL?

137
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,323
YEAH. DID I FOOL YOU?

138
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,325
TOTALLY.

139
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,827
SO IT DID GO WELL.

140
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,829
IT WENT AMAZINGLY WELL.

141
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,830
THAT'S GREAT. GREAT.

142
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,333
YEAH. IT'S DOWN TO  ME AND TWO OTHER GUYS

143
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,335
I KNOW BOTH OF THEM, AND THEY'RE REALLY GOOD.

144
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,837
ONE OF THEM IS THE GUY FROM THOSE ALLERGY COMMERCIALS

145
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,839
WHO'S ALWAYS GETTING CHASED BY THOSE BIG FLOWERS.

146
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,342
OH, I LOVE THAT GUY.

147
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,344
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

148
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,347
WHAT AM I DOING?

149
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,848
I'M SO NERVOUS, YOU KNOW.

150
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,351
THE CALLBACK ISN'T UNTIL TOMORROW AT 5:00.

151
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,853
I FEEL LIKE MY HEAD'S GOING TO EXPLODE.

152
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,855
WELL, IT IS OVERDUE.

153
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,358
LOOK, DON'T WORRY, OKAY?

154
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,859
YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.

155
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,361
YEAH, BUT IT'S JUST SO MUCH PRESSURE, YOU KNOW.

156
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,863
I MEAN, NO OFFENSE, BUT WHAT YOU GUYS ALL DO IS VERY DIFFERENT.

157
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,365
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

158
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,367
YEAH, NONE OF THE REST OF US

159
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,369
HAVE TO DEAL WITH PRESSURE AT OUR JOBS.

160
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,871
YES, FRAN, I KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS

161
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,375
BUT I'M LOOKING AT THE WEENUS AND I'M NOT HAPPY.

162
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,877
WELL, I'M TEAR ING THE LETTUCE.

163
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,879
UH HUH. IS IT DIRTY?

164
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,381
NO, DON'T WORRY, I'M GOING TO WASH IT.

165
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,384
DON'T. I LIKE IT DIRTY.

166
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,388
THAT'S YOUR CALL.

167
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,391
SO, UH... WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NEXT?

168
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,394
WELL, I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD CUT UP THE TOMATOES.

169
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,896
ARE THEY, UH, FIRM?

170
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,899
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT.

171
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,402
YOU SURE THEY HAVEN'T GONE BAD?

172
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,904
YOU SURE THEY'RE NOT VERY, VERY BAD?

173
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,410
NO, REALLY, THEY'RE OKAY.

174
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,912
YOU GOING TO SLICE THEM UP REAL NICE?

175
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,914
ACTUALLY, I WAS GOING TO DO THEM JULIENNE.

176
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,417

177
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,918
I'M OUT OF HERE.

178
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,420
MONICA, I'M QUITTING.

179
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,922
I JUST HELPED AN 81 YEAR OLD WOMAN PUT ON A THONG

180
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,424
AND SHE DIDN'T EVEN BUY IT.

181
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,426
I'M TELLING YOU, I'M QUITTING.

182
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,428
THAT'S IT. I'M TALKING TO MY BOSS RIGHT NOW.

183
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,429
YES, I AM.

184
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,930
YES, I AM. YES, I AM.

185
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,931
YES, I AM. YES, I AM. YES, I AM.

186
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,434
OKAY, BYE. CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THIS MESSAGE.

187
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,435
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

188
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,437
WELL, HE CAME IN FOR A MASSAGE...

189
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,439
AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE UNTIL...

190
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,445
OH... OH... OH, MY GOD.

191
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,949
AND, ALL OF A SUDDEN, HIS HANDS WEREN'T THE PROBLEM ANYMORE.

192
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,454
WAS IT...

193
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,458
OH, BOY SCOUTS COULD HAVE CAMPED UNDER THERE.

194
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,959
YOU ATE MY SANDWICH?

195
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,461
IT WAS A SIMPLE MISTAKE.

196
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,962
IT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE.

197
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,465
OH, REAL REALLY?

198
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,966
NOW, NOW, CALM DOWN.

199
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,468
COME LOOK IN MY OFFICE.

200
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,470
SOME OF IT MAY STILL BE IN THE TRASH.

201
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,973
WHAT?

202
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,475
WELL, IT WAS QUITE LARGE.

203
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,477
I HAD TO THROW MOST OF IT AWAY.

204
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,479
YOU... YOU... YOU...

205
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,483
YOU THREW MY SANDWICH AWAY?

206
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,485
MY SANDWICH?!

207
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,988
: MY SANDWICH?!

208
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,492
I JUST... I WANT THIS PART SO MUCH, YOU KNOW.

209
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,993
IF I DON'T GET THIS PART

210
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,496
I'M NEVER GOING TO EAT MACARONI AND CHEESE AGAIN.

211
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,998
NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT. THAT DOESN'T COUNT.

212
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,506
OH, COME ON, GUYS, IT'S NOT LIKE I MOVED TO EUROPE.

213
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,008
I JUST MOVED ACROSS THE HALL.

214
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,512
AND WE WOULD HAVE YOU OVER ALL THE TIME

215
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,515
IF IT WEREN'T FOR MONICA'S ALLERGIES.

216
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,516

217
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,517
YOU'RE RIGHT.

218
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,519
I COULD NEVER LIE TO YOU.

219
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,521
SHE HATES YOU.

220
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,523

221
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,525
SHOULD I GET THAT?

222
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,528
HELLO.

223
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,030
UH, NO, JOEY'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW.

224
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,532
CAN I TAKE A MESSAGE?

225
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:56,035
YEAH, OKAY, SO THE AUDITION'S BEEN MOVED FROM 5:00 TO 2:30.

226
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,038
OKAY, GREAT. BYE.

227
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,046

228
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,048
AREN'T YOU DRESSED YET?

229
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,051
AM I NAKED AGAIN?

230
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,555
WE'RE SUPPOSED  TO MEET MY PARENTS IN 15 MINUTES.

231
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,557
YEAH, OKAY, I WAS JUST TALKING TO THE GUYS.

232
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,558
LOOK AT THEM.

233
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,060
I MEAN, IS IT OKAY IF THEY COME VISIT?

234
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,562
WHAT ABOUT MY ALLERGIES?

235
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,064
OH, RIGHT.

236
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,566
YOUR ALLERGIES.

237
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,069
ALL HER. SHE HATES YOU.

238
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,582
OH, OH, OH , OH, OH, OH.

239
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,584
YES! HA HA HA!

240
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,086
HEY, HOW COOL WOULD IT BE

241
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,088
IF YOU COULD WATCH, LIKE, A REAL

242
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,590
LIFE SIZED VERSION OF THIS, HUH?

243
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,091
I MEAN, HOW CRAZY WOULD THAT BE?

244
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,594
AS CRAZY AS SOCCER?

245
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,095

246
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,099
HELLO.

247
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,601
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

248
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,603
THE AUDITION'S NOT TILL 5:00.

249
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,608
WELL, NOBODY TOLD ME.

250
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,110
WHO'D YOU TALK TO?

251
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,116
NEVER MIND.

252
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,620
YOU MEAN YOU DIDN'T GET IT FROM THIS?

253
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,623
THE ALLERGY GUY GOT THE PART. THANKS.

254
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,625
WELL, MAYBE WE CAN FIX IT, YOU KNOW

255
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:30,129
MAYBE WE CAN SEND HIM SOME, SOME BIG, BIG FLOWERS AND SCARE HIM.

256
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,631
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME, CHANDLER?

257
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,133
THIS PART COULD HAVE TURNED MY WHOLE CAREER AROUND.

258
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,135
I MESSED UP, OKAY?

259
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,637
I'M SORRY. I REALLY MESSED UP.

260
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,639
YOU DON'T EVEN LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

261
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,140
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ANSWERING MY PHONE? I HAVE A MACHINE.

262
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,642
WHICH I BOUGHT FOR YOU.

263
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,645
TAUGHT YOU HOW TO USE IT.

264
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,647
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS A COPIER.

265
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,150
LOOK, IF THERE WAS ANYTHING I COULD DO

266
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,652
I WOULD DO IT, OKAY?

267
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,154
BUT EVERYBODY'S ALLOWED ONE MISTAKE, RIGHT?

268
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,656
YOU KNOW, HE COULD'VE GOTTEN ME A VCR

269
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,157
HE COULD'VE GOTTEN  ME A SET OF GOLF CLUBS.

270
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,159
BUT, NO, HE HAS TO GET ME THE WOMAN REPELLER.

271
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,163
THE EYESORE FROM THE LIBERACE HOUSE OF CRAP!

272
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,666
IT'S NOT THAT BAD

273
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,667
OH, YEAH, EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

274
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,668
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WALK AROUND

275
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,670
SPORTING SOME REJECT FROM THE MR. T COLLECTION.

276
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,171
CHANDLER, CHANDLER...

277
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,674
I PITY THE FOOL WHO PUTS ON MY JEWELRY.

278
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,676
I DO! I DO! I PITY THE FOOL

279
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,177
IF I...

280
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,683
WHEN YOU WERE LATE LAST NIGHT, KATHY AND I GOT TO TALKING

281
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,686
AND... ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER, AND...

282
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,687
AND WHAT?

283
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,188
DID YOU SLEEP WITH HER?

284
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,190
NO, NO, NO. I JUST KISSED HER.

285
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,192
WHAT?! THAT'S EVEN WORSE!

286
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,194
HOW IS THAT WORSE?

287
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,196
I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S THE SAME.

288
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,698
YOU'RE RIGHT. I HAVE NO EXCUSES.

289
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,700
I WAS TOTALLY OVER THE LINE.

290
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,701
OVER THE LINE?

291
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,202
YOU'RE SO FAR PAST THE LINE

292
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,204
THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE THE LINE.

293
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,206
THE LINE IS A DOT TO YOU.

294
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,709
LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING

295
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,210
YOU SHOULD MAGICALLY FORGIVE ME

296
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,712
BUT YOU'RE NOT PERFECT.

297
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,714
YOU'VE MADE SOME ERRORS IN JUDGMENT, TOO.

298
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,215
NAME ONE.

299
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,218
WHAT HAPPENED?

300
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:03,723
OH, MAN! HE PROMISED HE WOULDN'T TAKE THE CHAIRS.

301
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,224
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

302
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,225
HOW WERE YOU LOCKED IN

303
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,728
AND WHERE THE HELL'S ALL OF OUR STUFF?

304
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,230
WELL, THIS GUY CAME BY TO LOOK AT THE UNIT

305
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,231
AND HE SAID HE DIDN'T THINK

306
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,233
IT WAS BIG ENOUGH TO FIT A GROWN MAN.

307
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,737
SO... YOU GOT IN VOLUNTARILY?

308
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,239
I WAS TRYING TO MAKE A SALE.

309
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,742
OH, MAN. IF I EVER RUN INTO THAT GUY AGAIN

310
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,243
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO?

311
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,244
BEND OVER?

312
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,747
THERE'S LORRAINE.

313
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,248
OKAY, NOW, REMEMBER--

314
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,249
NO TRADING.

315
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,752
YOU GET THE PRETTY ONE, I GET THE MESS.

316
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,253
HI, JOEY.

317
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,254
HEY.

318
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,760
WELL, WELL, LOOK WHAT YOU BROUGHT.

319
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,262
AND WHAT DID YOU BRING?

320
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,264
SHE'S CHECKING HER COAT.

321
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:49,268
JOEY, I'M GOING TO GO WASH THE CAB SMELL OFF MY HANDS.

322
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,771
WILL YOU GET ME A WHITE ZINFANDEL

323
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,273
AND A GLASS OF RED FOR JANICE.

324
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,279
JANICE?

325
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,783
JANICE?

326
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:09,789
OH... MY... GOD.

327
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,290
JOEY'S TAILOR...

328
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,792
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME.

329
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,794
WHAT?

330
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,295
NO WAY.

331
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,798
I'VE BEEN GOING TO THE GUY FOR 12 YEARS.

332
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,800
OH, COME ON. HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO MY INSEAM.

333
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,802
THEN HE RAN HIS HAND UP MY LEG

334
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,304
AND THEN, THERE WAS DEFINITE...

335
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,305
WHAT?

336
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,306
CUPPING.

337
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:34,313
THAT'S HOW THEY DO PANTS.

338
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,815
ROSS, WILL YOU TELL HIM?

339
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,817
ISN'T THAT HOW A TAILOR MEASURES PANTS?

340
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,319
YES, YES, IT IS-- IN PRISON!

341
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,325
I SAID, "NAMEONE."

342
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,329

343
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,334
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS.

344
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,836
WHAT AN IDIOT.

345
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,337
OH, STOP BEATING YOURSELF UP.

346
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,839
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.

347
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,340
THESE THINGS HAPPEN.

348
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,843
THERE AREN'T ANY MESSAGES

349
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,345
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN TO GIVE ME, ARE THERE?

350
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,348
APPARENTLY, YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT IT.

351
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,350
DO YOU THINK HE'LL EVER FORGIVE ME?

352
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,852
OF COURSE HE WILL. BUT, CHANDLER

353
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,354
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU FORGIVE YOURSELF.

354
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,355
YOU KNOW WHAT?

355
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,356
I KIND OF HAVE.

356
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,858
ALREADY?

357
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,860
THAT WAS PRETTY BAD, WHAT YOU DID.

358
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:21,861
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

359
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,362
HE WILL FORGIVE YOU

360
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,364
AND I LIKE TO BRING A PAD WITH ME

361
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,367
WHEN I GO ANSWER THE PHONE, JUST IN CASE... OKAY.

362
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,870
YOU DIDN'T SEE HOW MAD HE WAS, YOU KNOW?

363
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,371
I'M SURE HE WILL FORGIVE YOU.

364
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,873
LOOK, WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.

365
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,374
YOU KNOW, YOU FIGHT; YOU MAKE UP--

366
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,376
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT WORKS.

367
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,377
IT TOOK TWO PEOPLE

368
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,880
TO BREAK UP THIS RELATIONSHIP.

369
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,882
YEAH, YOU AND THAT GIRL FROM THE COPY PLACE

370
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,384
WHICH, YESTERDAY, YOU TOOK FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR.

371
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,886
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS

00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,888
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR, OKAY?

373
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,389
I DIDN'T FINISH THE WHOLE LETTER.

375
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,391
I FELL ASLEEP.

376
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,394
YOU FELL ASLEEP?

377
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,897
IT WAS 5:30  IN THE MORNING

378
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:02,902
AND YOU HAD RAMBLED ON FOR 18 PAGES.

379
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,906
FRONT AND BACK!

380
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,407

381
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,909
OH OH OH, AND, BY THE WAY--

00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,416
HA! YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE

386
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,919
I EVEN THOUGHT OF GETTING BACK TOGETHER WITH YOU.

387
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,420
WE ARE SO OVER.

388
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,422

IT'S NOT THAT COMMON

392
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,430
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO EVERY GUY

393
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,933
AND IT IS A BIG DEAL!

394
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,436
I KNEW IT!

00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,938
YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO GO OUT WITH HIM.

396
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,940
THAT IS THE MOST RIDICULOUS...

397
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,441
YOU SOLD ME OUT!

398
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,442
I DID NOT SELL YOU OUT!

399
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,443

YOU ABSOLUTELY SOLD ME... WOULD YOU LET ME TALK?!

401
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,950
DID YOU JUST FLICK ME?

OKAY, WELL, YOU WOULDN'T LET ME FINISH

403
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:54,954

408
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,464
HAPPY THOUGHTS!

409
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,966
HAPPY THOUGHTS!

410
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,967
NO! NO!

411
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,968
 STOP IT!

412
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,469
OH! OH!

413
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,471
OKAY, NOW I'M GOING TO KICK SOME ASS!

414
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,975
OW!

415
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,976

420
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,486
FINE.

FINE.

422
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:29,989
THERE WE GO.

423
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,490
YOU KNOW WHAT?

424
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,992
IF WE WERE IN PRISON

425
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,494
YOU GUYS WOULD BE, LIKE, MY BITCHES.

426
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,005
OKAY, BUDDY BOY, HERE IT IS.

434
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,524

435
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,527
WHOO! I TELL YOU, IT'S HOT WITH ALL THIS STUFF ON.

436
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,530

"THAT'LL BE A NEAT TRICK, WHEN YOU'RE...

00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,784
ROSS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO YELL.

THERE WAS JUST AN EXPLOSION, OKAY?

538
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,289
MY HEARING WOULD BE IMPAIRED.

539
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,790
I THOUGHT YOU WERE EXCELLENT.

540
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,792
