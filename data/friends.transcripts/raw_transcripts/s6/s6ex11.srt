00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:04,504
HEY!

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,006
HEY.

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,507
LISTEN, UH... YOU GUYS THINK

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,509
I HAVE A CHANCE WITH JANINE?

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,511
OH, HONEY, WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE.

6
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,013
YEAH. DON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF.

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,515
SHE MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,017
WELL, ALL RIGHT, THEN.

9
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,020
I GUESS I SHOULDN'T GET TOO EXCITED ABOUT THE FACT

10
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,021
THAT I JUST KISSED HER!

11
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,023
ARE YOU SERIOUS?! THAT'S GREAT!

12
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,024
REALLY?

13
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,525
YEAH? WELL, WE'LL SEE.

14
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,528
YOU KISSED HER?

15
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,531
OH, WE KISSED IT UP REAL NICE.

16
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,035
SO YOU ENDED UP WITH JANINE.

17
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,037
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

18
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,039
YOU WON FAIR AND SQUARE.

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,042
YEAH, IT WAS REAL NECK AND NECK THERE FOR A WHILE.

20
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,543
SO YOU KISSED HER.

21
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,545
SO WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT?

22
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,049
I CAME OVER HERE TO TELL YOU GUYS.

23
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,551
SO SHE'S JUST WAIT ING OVER THERE FOR YOU?

33
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,100
I GOT TO GO.

34
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,101
OKAY.

35
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,106
I'M GOING TO BE REALLY LATE FOR DANCE CLASS.

36
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,107
OKAY.

37
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,111
OKAY, NOW I'M REALLY LEAVING.

38
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,612
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

39
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,115
BUT, HEY, CAN YOU JUST... JUST LEAVE YOUR LIPS?

40
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,119
BYE.

41
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,120
BYE.

42
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,124
HAVE YOU KISSED HER YET?

43
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,127
IT'S AWESOME.

44
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,629
YOU KNOW, I COULD DO IT FOREVER.

45
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,630
YOU KNOW WHAT?

46
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,134
SHE KISSES BETTER THAN MY MOM COOKS.

47
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,637
I AM SO GLAD YOU SAID "COOKS."

48
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,141
LOOK, IT'S LIKE... IMAGINE YOUR BEST KISS EVER.

49
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,642
RIGHT? OKAY.

50
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:26,146
NOW MULTIPLY THAT BY, LIKE, TEN.

51
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,650
HUH? OH, NO, WAIT A SECOND.

52
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,651
YOU DATED ROSS.

53
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,153
AND YOU DATE CHANDLER.

54
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,655
OKAY, WAIT. MULTIPLY IT BY, LIKE, 50.

55
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,658
OH, HEY, RACHEL, SWEETHEART

56
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,160
YOU HAVE GOT TO TELL THE POST OFFICE

57
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,661
THAT YOU HAVE MOVED, OKAY?

58
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,164
WE'RE STILL GETTING ALL YOUR BILLS AND STUFF.

59
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,165
OH.

60
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,166
OOH, OOH, POTTERY BARN.

61
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,667
YOU CAN THROW THE REST AWAY.

62
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,170
I'M NOT YOUR GARBAGEMAN.

63
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,173
I'M YOUR MAILMAN.

64
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,674
MONICA, LOOK.

65
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,176
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

66
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,678
HERE IS THAT TABLE THAT I ORDERED. AH...

67
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,680
YOU GOT IT FROM POTTERY BARN?

68
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,681
YEAH.

69
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,183
IT'S AN APOTHECARY TABLE.

70
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,685
DOES ANYONE EVEN KNOW WHAT AN APOTHECARY IS?

71
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,187
A PHARMACIST.

72
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,190
"A PHARMACIST."

73
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,694
RACHE, PHOEBE HATES POTTERY BARN.

74
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,196
I HATE POTTERY BARN, TOO.

75
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,699
THEY KICKED ME OUT OF THERE JUST BECAUSE I SAT ON A BED.

76
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,702
YOU TOOK OFF YOUR PANTS AND CLIMBED UNDER THE SHEETS.

77
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,706
I WAS TIRED.

78
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,210
PHOEBE HATES POTTERY BARN?

79
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,212
YEAH. SHE HATES ALL MASS PRODUCED STUFF.

80
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,714
SHE THINKS HER FURNITURE SHOULD HAVE A HISTORY--

81
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,216
A STORY BEHIND IT.

82
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,718
WELL, THIS HAS A STORY BEHIND IT.

83
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,220
I MEAN, THEY HAD TO SHIP IT

84
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,723
ALL THE WAY FROM THE WHITE PLAINS STORE.

85
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,226
IT'S GOT TO  BE ONE OF A KIND.

86
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,727
YOU KNOW, LIKE THE, UM....

87
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,728
YOU KNOW THAT, UM...

88
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,230
WHAT'S THAT GOD AW FUL CERAMIC FRUIT BOWL

89
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,731
THAT SHE HAS ON HER COUNTER?

90
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,734
HEY, I MADE THAT FOR HER.

91
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,237
YOU MADE POTTERY?

92
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,739
YEAH. I MADE IT OUT OF THIS FRUIT BOWL

93
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,241
I FOUND IN THE GARBAGE.

94
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,242
I'M TELLING YOU

95
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,744
IF YOU PUT THAT IN HER APARTMENT

96
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,746
YOU WILL NEVER HEAR THE END OF IT.

97
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,748
OKAY, FINE, I'LL JUST TELL HER

98
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,750
THAT IT'S AN ANTIQUE APOTHECARY TABLE.

99
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,253
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM.

100
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,255
OH, I LOVE THESE LITTLE DRAWERS.

101
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,757
OH, LOOK, LOOK. IT SAYS THAT IT HOLDS 300 CDs.

102
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:21,261
AH, JUST LIKE THE APOTHECARY TABLES OF YORE.

103
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,264
YOUR WHAT?

104
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,267
WHAT? WHAT?

105
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,269
ENJOY THE CATALOG, SWEETHEART.

106
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,778
SO THEN THE FARMER SAYS

107
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,781
"THAT'S NOT A COW  AND YOU'RE NOT MILKING."

108
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,783
I AM SO GLAD THAT YOU GUYS GOT TOGETHER.

109
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,285
CHANDLER AND I ARE ALWAYS LOOKING

110
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,787
FOR A COUPLE TO GO OUT WITH, AND NOW WE HAVE ONE.

111
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,290
LOOK AT US-- WE'RE A COUPLE OF COUPLES.

112
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,292
I HAD SO MUCH FUN TONIGHT.

113
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,793
AND WHAT A GREAT RESTAURANT.

114
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,295
YEAH, YEAH, AND CHANDLER

115
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,798
I CAN'T BELIEVE I LET YOU PAY FOR THIS ONE.

116
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,302
THANKS AGAIN, MAN.

117
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,304
SO IF YOU GUYS WANT TO COME OVER TOMORROW

118
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,806
I'LL MAKE THAT PASTA THING I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

119
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,807
OH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

120
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,808
BUT, HEY, LOOK

121
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,810
AT LEAST LET US BRING THE WINE.

122
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,312
JOEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

123
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,813
I INSIST.

124
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,318
YOU'LL GET THE WINE, RIGHT?

125
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,319
YEAH, OKAY.

126
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,822
OKAY, GOOD NIGHT, GUYS.

127
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,823
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

128
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,325
CAN'T WAIT.

129
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,333
HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET OUT OF THAT ONE?

130
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,337
WHAT?

131
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,840
I CAN'T HANDLE TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW WITH THEM.

132
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,843
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MONICA AND CHANDLER?

133
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,347
I DON'T KNOW. THEY'RE JUST A LITTLE... BLAH.

134
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,849
"BLAH"?

135
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,852
WELL, YOU KNOW, HE'S BLAH.

136
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,354
SHE'S JUST...

137
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,357
SHE'S VERY LOUD FOR SUCH A SMALL PERSON.

138
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,861
UH, THEY'RE, LIKE, MY BEST FRIENDS.

139
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,364
ARE YOU SAYING WE CAN'T HANG OUT WITH THEM

140
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,866
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE KIND OF A PROBLEM.

141
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,369
NO, OF COURSE WE CAN STILL HANG OUT WITH THEM.

142
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,871
JUST, YOU KNOW, NOT TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW.

143
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,874
OKAY?

144
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,876
I GUESS.

145
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,378
THANK YOU.

146
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,880
HMM.

147
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,882
IF YOU WANT, I'LL SELL MY FRIENDS

148
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,385
AND USE THE MONEY TO BUY YOU PRESENTS.

149
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,891
HEY.

150
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,393
HEY.

151
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,895
OOH, WHAT A GREAT TABLE.

152
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,398
WHERE? WHERE DID YOU GET IT?

153
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,899
GUESS.

154
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,901
UM, A FLEA MARKET?

155
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,403
OH!

156
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,406
SEE, I KNEW. I KNEW YOU WOULD GET IT ON THE FIRST GUESS.

157
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,907
ISN'T IT COOL?

158
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,909
IT'S AN APOTHECARY TABLE.

159
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,911
WOW...

160
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,914
OH, YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE THAT THIS IS WHERE THEY KEPT ALL

161
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,418
THE STUFF TO MAKE THEIR POTIONS, YOU KNOW.

162
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,419
YES.

163
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,421
YOU CAN ALMOST SMELL THE OPIUM.

164
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,425
ALMOST.

165
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,926
OH, HOW MUCH WAS IT?

166
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,928
ONLY 500 BUCKS.

167
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,930
500 BUCKS AT A FLEA MARKET?

168
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,932
OH, OKAY, SEE, I THOUGHT YOU MEANT

169
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,435
HOW MUCH WAS IT WHEN IT WAS NEW.

170
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,936
YOU KNOW, LIKE BACK THEN?

171
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,937
OH, NO.

172
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,939
I MEAN, IT WAS AT A FLEA MARKET

173
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,942
SO IT WAS, YOU KNOW, IT WAS, LIKE, A DOLLAR.

174
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,444
A DOLLAR?

175
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,945
AND 50.

176
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,948
SO, YOU KNOW, IT WAS, LIKE, ONE AND 50 DOLLARS.

177
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,451
OH, OKAY, THEY GAVE YOU THE OLD TIME PRICING.

178
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,952
YEAH.

179
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,955
WELL, WHAT PERIOD IS IT FROM?

180
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,457
UH, IT'S FROM YORE.

181
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,959
LIKE THE DAYS OF YORE, YOU KNOW.

182
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,960
YES, YES, I DO.

183
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,962
GOD... OH, IT'S JUST PERFECT.

184
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,464
WOW, I BET IT HAS

185
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,466
A GREAT STORY BEHIND IT, TOO.

186
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,967
DID THEY TELL YOU ANYTHING?

187
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,470
LIKE, YOU KNOW, WHERE IT'S FROM OR...?

188
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,471
OH, YES, THAT I KNOW.

189
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,473
THIS IS FROM, UH, WHITE PLAINS.

190
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,474

191
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,476
WHITE PLAINS.

192
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,977
MM HMM.

193
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,979
OH, IT SOUNDS LIKE SUCH A MAGICAL PLACE.

194
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,985
HEY! I'M HERE.

195
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,986
HEY.

196
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,989
OH... OH, MY GOD.

197
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:10,990
YOU LIKE IT?

198
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,991
OH, MY GOD.

199
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,994
IT'S MY NEW APOTHECARY TABLE.

200
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,996
ROSS, PHOEBE IS GOING TO BE HERE ANY SECOND.

201
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,498
SHE CANNOT SEE THIS.

202
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,500
WELL, WHY NOT? SHE'LL LOVE IT.

203
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,501
IT'S THE REAL THING.

204
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,002
I GOT IT AT POTTERY BARN.

205
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,004
I KNOW YOU DID. I BOUGHT THE SAME ONE.

206
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,507
AND IF SHE SEES YOUR TABLE, SHE'S GOING TO KNOW

207
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,508
THAT I LIED TO HER.

208
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,510
I TOLD HER THAT OURS WAS AN ORIGINAL.

209
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,011
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

210
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,013
BECAUSE SHE HATES POTTERY BARN.

211
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,517
SHE HATES POTTERY BARN?

212
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,018
I KNOW, I KNOW.

213
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,521
SHE SAYS IT'S ALL MASS PRODUCED, NOTHING IS AUTHENTIC

214
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,023
AND EVERYONE WINDS UP HAVING THE SAME STUFF.

215
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,528
SO, COME ON. SHE'S GOING TO BE HERE ANY SECOND.

216
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,530
CAN WE PLEASE JUST COVER THIS UP

217
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,531
WITH SOMETHING, PLEASE.

218
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,033
NO, NO. I AM NOT GOING TO HIDE IT FROM PHOEBE.

219
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,036
OH, ALTHOUGH I DID GET SOME GREAT POTTERY BARN SHEETS.

220
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,037
OOH!

221
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,040
OH, I FORGOT THEY MADE SHEETS.

222
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,542
YAH.

223
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,046
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE SHE HATES POTTERY BARN.

224
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,047
ROSS, GET OVER IT.

225
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,549
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE HATES YOU.

226
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,051
YEAH, BUT POTTERY BARN.

227
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,555
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

228
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,557
SHE'S WEIRD, YOU KNOW.

229
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,058
IT'S BECAUSE SHE'S A TWIN.

230
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,060
TWINS ARE WEIRD.

231
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,062
ROSS, SHE'S NOT WEIRD.

232
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,565
SHE JUST LIKES HER STUFF TO BE ONE OF A KIND.

233
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,568
YOU KNOW WHAT'S NOT ONE OF A KIND?

234
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,570
A TWIN.

235
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,072
HEY.

236
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,073
HEY.

237
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,074
OH, PHOEBE'S HERE.

238
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,576
SO LET'S TURN OUT ALL THE LIGHTS

239
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,077
AND WE'LL JUST WATCH THE MOVIE.

240
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,079
OKAY. HEY, OOH, COOL SHEET.

241
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,081
OH, YOU LIKE IT?

242
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,583
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE I GOT IT?

243
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:44,584
SURE.

244
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,586
HE GOT IT AT A FLEA MARKET.

245
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,589
YOU BOUGHT YOUR SHEETS AT A FLEA MARKET?

246
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,593
ROSS, COME ON, YOU GOTTA LOOSEN

247
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,095
THE PURSE STRINGS A LITTLE.

248
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,096
HEY.

249
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,097
HI.

250
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,099
SO, DINNER WILL BE READY IN 20 MINUTES.

251
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,100
I'M SO EXCITED.

252
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,603
AND HERE IS THE BOTT LE OF WINE FOR YOU

253
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,605
TO BRING OVER TONIGHT.

254
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,106
YOU WERE ALSO GOING TO BUY MONICA FLOWERS

255
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,608
BUT YOU COULDN'T AFFORD IT

256
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,109
BECAUSE YOU PAID FOR DINNER LAST NIGHT.

257
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,611
THANKS, THANKS.

258
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,614
BUT, UH, ACTUALLY, IT'S JUST GOING TO BE ME TONIGHT.

259
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,115
WHAT HAPPENED TO JANINE?

260
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,118
WELL, SHE'S, UH, REALLY SICK.

261
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,620
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

262
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,622
YEAH, SHE'S BEEN IN THERE ALL DAY.

263
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,123
HIGH FEVER, NOSE PROBLEM...

264
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,628
IT'S... PHLEGM, PHLEGM, PHLEGM, PHLEGM, PHLEGM.

265
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,630

266
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,132
MONICA, CHANDLER.

267
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,636
I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY ABOUT TONIGHT.

268
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,137
I DON'T KNOW IF JOEY TOLD YOU

269
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,640
BUT I JUST COULDN'T GET OUT OF GOING TO THIS PLAY.

270
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,141
I'M SORRY.

271
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,145
HAVE A GREAT TIME, HUH?

272
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,647
BYE.

273
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,150
THAT'S FUNNY.

274
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,652
I SAW NO PHLEGM.

275
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,155
NO, NO. SHE REALLY IS SICK.

276
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,657
THEN WHY IS SHE GOING TO A PLAY?

277
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,158
UH, WELL, YOU KNOW--

278
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,662
STARVE A FEVER, GO TO A PLAY FOR A COLD.

279
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,667
JOEY, WHY IS JANINE NOT COMING OVER FOR DINNER?

280
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,668
WELL, UH

281
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,670
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO HANG OUT WITH YOU GUYS

282
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:11,671
TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW.

283
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,172
I'M SO SORRY.

284
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,175
WHY DOES SHE NOT WANT TO HANG OUT WITH US?

285
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:21,681
BECAUSE SHE, UH, SHE... SHE THINKS THAT YOU ARE BLAH

286
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,683
AND AND THAT YOU

287
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,686
MONICA, ARE TOO LOUD.

288
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,187
WHAT?!

289
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,190
WHAT?

290
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,692
SO SHE WAS JUST PRETENDING

291
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,193
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME LAST NIGHT?

292
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,695
SHE WAS LYING TO OUR FACES?

293
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,697
 I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS

294
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,198
I MEAN, WHO IS SHE TO JUDGE US?

295
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,200
WE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN NICER TO HER.

296
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,201
AND I AM NOT BLAH.

297
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,703
I AM A HOOT.

298
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,704
I KNOW, I KNOW.

299
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,206
COME ON, PLEASE, YOU GUYS, DON'T BE MAD.

300
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,208
I'M SURE SHE JUST SAID THAT STUFF

301
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,710
BECAUSE SHE WAS NERVOUS BECAUSE

302
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,211
YOU GUYS ARE, LIKE, MY BEST FRIENDS.

303
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,214
YOU KNOW, AND IT WAS OUR FIRST DATE

304
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,217
PLUS, SHE'S REALLY SICK.

305
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,720
NO, NO, YOU SAID YOU MADE THAT UP.

306
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,221
I KNOW, BUT DON'T YOU THINK

307
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,224
THE SICK THING IS WAY BETTER THAN THE PLAY THING?

308
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,726
WELL, THEY'RE BOTH GOOD.

309
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,729
I GENERALLY JUST GO WITH "MONICA'S DRUNK AGAIN."

310
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,733
COME ON, YOU GUYS, COME ON, PLEASE, PLEASE

311
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,234
JUST GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE, HUH?

312
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,736
SHE'LL COME AROUND, I PROMISE.

313
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,237
OF COURSE WE WILL.

314
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,239
COME ON, WE'VE GOT TO MAKE DINNER.

315
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,741
OKAY.

316
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,747
 I DO NOT LIKE THAT WOMAN!

317
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,250
I CAN HEAR YOU!

318
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,752
Monica:I AM LOUD.

319
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,757
AW. AW. AW.

320
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,260

321
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,265
HEY, PHEEBS, CAN YOU PLEASE NOT PUT YOUR FEET UP

322
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,767
ON MY NEW...

323
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,769
OLD SHEET?

324
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,770
OH, SURE.

325
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,271
OH! AAH!

326
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,774
MY APOTHECARY TABLE!

327
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,275
WHAT?!

328
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,777
NO!

329
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,779
ROSS, WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?!

330
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,280
I GOT IT AT POTTERY BARN, OKAY?!

331
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,785
OH, MY GOD!

332
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,788
PHOEBE, POTTERY BARN HAS RIPPED OFF

333
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,790
THE DESIGN OF OUR ANTIQUE!

334
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,291
WOW! OH, MY GOD!

335
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,794
WELL, IF THEY'VE RIPPED OFF OUR TABLE

336
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,297
OURS MUST BE WORTH MUCH MORE THAN ONE AND 50 DOLLARS.

337
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,301
WOW, THIS DOESN'T EVEN SMELL LIKE OPIUM.

338
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,302
OF COURSE NOT.

339
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,805
IT SMELLS LIKE WINE, WHICH YOU SPILLED.

340
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,307
AND THANKS FOR WRECKING MY SHEET, BY THE WAY.

341
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,308
OH, ROSS, CALM DOWN.

342
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,311
I'LL GIVE  YOU THE 80 CENTS.

343
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,818
OKAY, ONE MORE TIME.

344
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,320
CHANDLER, WOULD YOU LIKE SOME MORE ORANGE JUICE?

345
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,822
PERFECT DECIBEL.

346
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,824
I KNOW!

347
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,826
HEY.

348
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,327
HEY.

349
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,329
SO, UH, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

350
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,330
OH, NOTHING.

351
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,331
WE'RE JUST TALKING.

352
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,333
YOU KNOW, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

353
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,334
LOOK, COME ON, YOU GUYS.

354
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,336
YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO TRY.

355
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,838
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I CAME OVER HERE

356
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,340
TO INVITE YOU GUYS TO A MOVIE WITH ME AND JANINE.

357
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,842
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

358
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,846
WELL, I'D LIKE TO, BUT I'M...

359
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,847
HA, HA, VERY FUNNY....

360
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,849
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

361
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,851
I REALLY WANT YOU GUYS TO GET ALONG.

362
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,853
JUST, PLEASE, COME TO THE MOVIE WITH US.

363
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,854
YOU OWE ME.

364
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,855
WE OWE YOU?

365
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,856
THAT'S RIGHT.

366
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,357
I HELPED YOU GUYS OUT A LOT

367
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,859
IN THE START OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

368
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,361
I HELPED YOU SNEAK AROUND FOR, LIKE, SIX MONTHS.

369
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,363
I LOOKED LIKE AN IDIOT...

370
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,865
AND AND I WAS HUMILIATED.

371
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,867
AND I ONLY MADE $200 DOLLARS.

372
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,371
WE DIDN'T GIVE YOU ANY MONEY.

373
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,877
YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW THAT?!

374
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,382
SEE, I CAN'T DECIDE WHETHER IT WOULD GO BETTER

375
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,384
NEXT TO THE NEW WICKER DINING CHAIR

376
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,385
THE SAHARA DESK

377
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,888
OR THE PARKER CONSOLE TABLE.

378
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,889
WOW, I DIDN'T KNOW

379
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,390
THERE WAS A POTTERY BARN UP HERE.

380
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,893
I KNOW, I KNOW, I WENT A LITTLE CRAZY.

381
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,394
A LITTLE?

382
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,397
YOUR PLACE LOOKS LIKE PAGE 72 OF THE CATALOG.

383
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,900
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

384
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,905
THE ORNAMENTAL BIRDCAGE, LARGE.

385
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:06,906
HEY.

386
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,407
HEY. HEY.

387
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,408
OH, ROSS, NOW BE CAREFUL.

388
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:10,910
THAT IS VERY OLD.

389
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,412
OKAY, EARLY COLONIAL BIRD MERCHANTS

390
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,915
USED TO BRING THEIR BIRDS TO MARKET IN THAT.

391
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,417
FASCINATING.

392
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,419

393
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,422
ANOTHER AMAZING FIND.

394
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,423
WOW!

395
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,926
OH, I BET THIS HAS A GREAT STORY, TOO.

396
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,427
IT DOES, IT DOES.

397
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,931
IT IS A ROOM SEPARATING APPARATUS FROM COLONIAL TIMES.

398
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,432
AH.

399
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,434
HUH! A LOT OF THIS STUFF.

400
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,936
IS FROM THE COLONIAL TIMES.

401
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,439
HEY, WHAT ARE SOME OTHER TIME PERIODS, RACHEL?

402
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,443
WELL, THERE'S YORE...

403
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,948
AND, UH...

404
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,950
YOU KNOW, YESTERYEAR.

405
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,952
YEAH... NO, I'M TELLING YOU

406
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,954
RACHEL HAS SUCH A GOOD EYE FOR THIS STUFF.

407
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,956
ROSS, YOU KNOW, IF YOU EVER DECIDE

408
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,458
TO REDECORATE-- AND I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD...

409
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,962
YOU SHOULD ASK RACHEL TO HELP.

410
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,964
OH, HONEY, HE DOESN'T NEED MY HELP.

411
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,466
COME ON. I THINK HE'S READY TO GET RID OF THE...

412
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,467
WHAT DID YOU CALL IT?

413
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,469
THE "CHEAP KNOCKOFFS" AND "DINOSAUR JUNK."

414
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,975
REALLY?

415
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,977
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

416
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,479
SINCE YOU HAVE SUCH A GREAT SENSE

417
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,482
OF WHAT I NEED, UH, OH, HERE'S 60 BUCKS.

418
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,484
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE PHOEBE

419
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,487
DOWN TO THAT COLONIAL FLEA MARKET OF YOURS

420
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,989
AND GET ME SOME STUFF.

421
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,493
YOU KNOW WHAT?

422
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,496
I DON'T REALLY THINK PHOEBE WANTS TO COME...

423
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:37,997
NO, I DO WANT TO.

424
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,498
OH, SHE DOES WANT TO.

425
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,000
SHE DOES WANT TO.

426
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,501
LET ME GET MY COAT.

427
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,003
OKAY.

428
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,505
HEY... HEY, CAN I HAVE ALL THIS STUFF

429
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,507
WHEN SHE MAKES YOU THROW IT OUT?

430
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,009
WELL, SURE.

431
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,510
AND I'LL SHOW YOU

432
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,512
RIGHT WHERE YOU CAN PUT IT.

433
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,019
PHEEBS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

434
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,021
I GUESS THE FLEA MARKET

435
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,522
WAS JUST BETTER LAST TIME.

436
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,025
AT LEAST I GOT THESE SHEETS FOR ROSS.

437
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,526
YEAH.

438
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,029
UGH. LOOK AT THIS-- POTTERY BARN.

439
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,531
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT? DON'T LOOK AT IT.

440
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,533
SERIOUSLY, DON'T LOOK AT IT.

441
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,535
LOOK, LOOK! THERE'S THE COFFEE TABLE

442
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,536
THEY STOLE FROM US.

443
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,039
AAH, THOSE BASTARDS! LET'S GO.

444
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,542
HEY, THAT FAN KIND OF LOOKS LIKE OURS

445
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,544
AND THE BIRDCAGE AND...

446
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,548
WAIT A SEC. THIS IS OUR EXACT LIVING ROOM.

447
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,550
NO, NO, NO, IT'S NOT. NO, IT'S NOT.

448
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,553
COME ON, PHOEBE. OURS IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

449
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,554
I MEAN, WE DON'T HAVE THE...

450
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:36,555
WE DON'T HAVE...

451
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,557
WE DON'T HAVE THAT LAMP.

452
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,060
AND THAT SCREEN IS, YOU KNOW

453
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,562
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

454
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,565
OH, MY GOD. THIS IS WHERE YOU GOT ALL OUR STUFF--

455
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:51,070
POTTERY BARN! OH, MY GOD!

456
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,072
OKAY, OKAY, WAIT, I DID, ALL RIG HT, I'M SORRY...

457
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,574
IT'S JUST THAT, PHOEBE, I WANTED THIS STUFF

458
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,576
AND I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT POTTERY BARN.

459
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,578
SO JUST... COME ON, DON'T BE MAD.

460
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,080
BUT I AM MAD! I AM MAD

461
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,583
BECAUSE THIS STUFF IS EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG WITH THE WORLD

462
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,086
AND IT'S ALL SITTING UP IN MY LIVING ROOM!

463
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,587
AND ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS

464
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,590
HOW I DON'T HAVE THAT LAMP!

465
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,093
WELL, THEN, HONEY, BUY THE LAMP.

466
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,595
HEY, WE HAVE THAT 60 BUCKS FROM ROSS.

467
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,100
I CAN'T! I CAN'T!

468
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,102
UNLESS... WELL, ARE YOU SAYING

469
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:27,106
THAT YOU WOULD MOVE OUT IF I DIDN'T BUY THAT LAMP?

470
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,108
WHA...? NO! I'M NOT GOING TO MOVE OUT.

471
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,111
ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU WOULD MOVE OUT

472
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,612
IF I DIDN'T BUY THAT LAMP?!

473
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,116
OH, YES! I WOULD SO MOVE OUT.

474
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,617
OKAY, THEN I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE!

475
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,618
I HAVE TO BUY THAT LAMP!

476
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,121
THAT'S RIGHT.

477
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,623
BUT AT LEAST THE APOTHECARY TABLE'S REAL.

478
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,130
WELL, THIS WAS GREAT.

479
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,632
DIDN'T EVERYBODY HAVE A GREAT TIME?

480
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,134
WELL, I DID. I REALLY DID.

481
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,635
YOU KNOW, GUYS, I GOT TO SAY

482
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,637
I'M SORRY IF I WAS A LITTLE WEIRD

483
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,139
AFTER THE LAST TIME WE WENT OUT.

484
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,141
I GUESS I WAS JUST NERVOUS OR SOMETHING.

485
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,642
THAT'S TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE.

486
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,144
YEAH. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

487
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,645
SO WE CAN GO OUT AGAIN?

488
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,646
OH, YEAH.

489
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,647
ABSOLUTELY.

490
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,648
OH, WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

491
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,150
GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT.

492
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,156
SEE? HUH?

493
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,657
WASN'T THAT FUN?

494
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,659
WE HAVE GOT TO MOVE.

495
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,661
WHAT?

496
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,163
I KNEW IT!

497
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,667
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT SO QUIET YOURSELF, MISSY!

498
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,170
AND I'M BLAH?

499
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,172
LISTEN, THE ONLY THING THAT'S MORE BORING

500
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,673
THAN WATCHING MODERN DANCE

501
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,675
IS HAVING TO LISTEN TO YOU TALK ABOUT IT.

502
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,179
"OH, CHANDLER, I JUST LOST MYSELF IN THE MOVEMENT."

503
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,682
YOU KNOW, I KNOW YOU'RE TALKING

504
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,185
BUT ALL I HEAR IS, "BLAH, BLAH, BLAH

505
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,186
BLAH, BLAH."

506
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,689
ALL RIGHT, YOU AND ME, LET'S GO, RIGHT NOW!

507
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,191
ALL RIGHT. ENOUGH. ENOUGH!

508
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,193
ENOUGH! ENOUGH!

509
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,194
YOU TWO GO HOME.

510
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,195
I'VE GOT TO TALK TO JANINE.

511
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,697
I REALLY THINK YOU CAN TAKE HER.

512
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,700
YOU BETTER HOPE I DON'T SEE YOU IN THE HALLWAY!

513
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,702
ALL RIGHT.

514
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,707
ALL RIGHT, UH...

515
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,210
WE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM HERE.

516
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,711
THESE PEOPLE ARE MY FRIENDS.

517
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,213
YOU CAN'T TREAT THEM THAT WAY.

518
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,215
THEY SAID STUFF TO ME, TOO, YOU KNOW.

519
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,218
I KNOW, I KNOW, AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT IT.

520
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,719
BUT... THEY MEAN SO MUCH TO ME.

521
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,721
THEY'RE LIKE MY FAMILY, YOU KNOW.

522
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,224
IF YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO BE FIGHTING

523
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,226
ALL THE TIME...

524
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,228
I DON'T THINK WE CAN BE TOGETHER.

525
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,231
IT JUST CAN'T WORK, OKAY?

526
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,232
IT CAN'T.

527
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,734
I'M VERY UPSET.

528
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,237
OKAY, OKAY, WOULD IT HELP

529
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,240
IF I WENT OVER AND APOLOGIZED?

530
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,743
YAH. YEAH, THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. YEAH.

531
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,751
WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT THE HALL?

532
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:57,756
I WAS JUST COMING OVER HERE TO APOLOGIZE FOR MY BEHAVIOR.

533
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,760
I WOULD REALLY LIKE IT IF WE COULD BE FRIENDS.

534
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:08,767
WELL, I KNOW THAT WOULD MAKE JOEY HAPPY

535
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,770
SO... I WOULD LIKE THAT, TOO.

536
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:12,771
GREAT.

537
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,273
COME ON.

538
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,278
WELL, I'M GLAD WE WORKED THINGS OUT.

539
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,279
ME, TOO.

540
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,280
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU.

541
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,281
BYE.

542
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,282
OR I'LL HEAR YOU.

543
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,784
THAT'S IT, BIG GIRL. COME ON!

544
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,287
WAIT!

545
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,792
YOU BETTER RUN!

546
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,795
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

547
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,796
YEAH.

548
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,299
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

549
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,800
I DON'T KNOW. I'M SORRY, MAN.

550
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,803
YOU WANT TO GO WATCH?

551
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,804
YEAH.

552
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,814
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE YOU COULD HAVE TAKEN JANINE.

553
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,817
I COULD HAVE TAKEN HER.

554
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,320
WELL, SHE'S MUCH BIGGER THAN YOU ARE.

555
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,821
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

556
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,823
I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH TALL GIRLS.

557
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,825
YOU GO FOR THEIR KNEES.

558
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,329
HEY. HOW YOU DOING?

559
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,830
HEY, YOURSELF.

560
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,332
DID SHE MOVE OUT?

561
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,334
PRETTY MUCH. YEAH.

562
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,836
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU BROKE UP WITH HER JUST LIKE THAT.

563
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,339
WELL, WHEN IT'S NOT RIGHT, YOU KNOW IT.

564
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,340
YOU OKAY?

565
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,842
YEAH, I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

566
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,845
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD CHEER YOU UP?

567
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,846
WHAT?

568
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,348

570
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,355

571
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,359

572
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,364
