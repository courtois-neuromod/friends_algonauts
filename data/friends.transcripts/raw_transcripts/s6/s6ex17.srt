1
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,007
HEY, REMEMBER WHEN I HAD A MONKEY?

2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,508
YEAH. MM HMM.

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,011
YEAH, WHAT... WHAT WAS I THINKING?

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,015
HEY, SO... WHAT'S WITH THE 20% PERCANTGE TIP?

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,517
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?

6
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:20,520
20% PRECENTAGE IS A PRETTY GENEROUS TIP, JOE.

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,023
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT'S MORE GENEROUS THAN THAT? 50%.

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,524
YOU KNOW WHAT'S

9
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,026
EVEN MORE GENEROUS THAN THAT?

10
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,527
I SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,530
WHAT'S UP WITH THE GREED, JOE?

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,532
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I'M SORRY, YOU GUYS

13
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,533
BUT IT'S JUST THAT I GOT TO GET

14
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,036
THESE NEW HEAD SHOTS MADE, AND THEY'RE REALLY EXPENSIVE

15
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,037
YOU KNOW?

16
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,539
I'M DOWN TO, LIKE, THREE.

17
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,041
ACTUALLY, TWO, BECAUSE ONE OF THEM

18
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,043
I KIND OF BLACKENED IN SOME TEETH.

19
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,545
WHY'D I DO THAT? GOD!

20
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,547
WELL, ISN'T THERE SOMETHING YOU CAN DO

21
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,049
TO EARN A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY?

22
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,550
I MEAN, CAN'T YOU PICK UP...

23
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,052
I DON'T KNOW, AN EXTRA SHIFT HERE?

24
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,555
OR... YOU KNOW, I US ED TO BEG FOR MONEY.

25
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,558
OF COURSE, IT HELPS

26
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,560
IF YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE OF THIS GOING ON.

27
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,562
WOW. I STILL HAVE IT.

28
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,563
 YEAH.

29
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,066
OH, WAIT, WAIT. DON'T YOU HAVE AN AUDITION TODAY?

30
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,567
YEAH, MAYBE YOU'LL GET THAT JOB.

31
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,069
OH, HA, HA, HA.

32
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,571
OOH!

33
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,074
WAIT A MINUTE-- I USED TO GET MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS

34
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,075
DONE ON ME ALL THE TIME.

35
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,578
AH, FINALLY AN EXPLANATION.

36
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,080
NO, NO, I USED TO GET PAID

37
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,582
FOR ALL KINDS OF MEDICAL STUFF, REMEMBER?

38
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:26,086
LET'S SEE, UH... WELL, I DON'T WANT TO DONATE SPERM AGAIN.

39
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,089
I REALLY PREFER DOING THAT AT THE HOME OFFICE, YOU KNOW.

40
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,590
OOH, OOH!

41
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,594
MAYBE THEY WANT SOME OF MY BLOOD OR SPIT OR SOMETHING, HUH? JOEY.

42
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,097
YEAH. WHAT'D I TELL YOU ABOUT TALKING TO YOUR FRIENDS

43
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,598
WHILE YOU'RE WORKING?

44
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,101
UH... DO IT?

45
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,104
THAT GUY'S BEEN WAITING FOR HIS COFFEE FOR TEN MINUTES.

46
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,106
HE'S COMPLAINED ABOUT YOU THREE TIMES.

47
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,111
WELL, WHERE WAS I?

57
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,684
HI. HEY.

58
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:33,186
HEY, WHAT HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN UP TO?

59
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,687
OH, WE WENT TO A SELF DEFENSE CLASS TODAY.

60
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,189
WOW. YEAH.

61
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,658
KICKING A GUY IN THE CROTCH ALL MORNING

62
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,160
REALLY TAKES IT OUT OF YOU.

63
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,662
TAKES IT OUT OF YOU?

64
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,165
NO, NOW WE CAN KICK ANYBODY'S ASS.

65
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,166
YEAH.

66
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,167
AFTER ONE CLASS?

67
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,668
I DON'T THINK SO.

68
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,670
WHAT? YOU WANT TO SEE ME SELF DEFEND MYSELF?

69
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,173
GO OVER THERE AND PRETEND YOU'RE A SEXUAL PREDATOR.

70
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,175
GO ON, I DARE YOU!

71
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,677
WELL, OF COURSE, YOU CAN DEFEND YOURSELF

72
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,180
FROM AN ATTACK YOU KNOW IS COMING.

73
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,182
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

74
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,685
LOOK, I STUDIED KARATEY FOR A LONG TIME

75
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,188
AND THERE'S A CONCEPT

76
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,690
YOU SHOULD REALLY BE FAMILIAR WITH.

77
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,694
IT'S WHAT THE JAPANESE CALL UNAGI.

78
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,698
ISN'T THAT A KIND OF SUSHI?

79
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,700
NO. IT'S A CONCEPT.

80
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,702
YEAH, IT IS. IT IS. IT'S FRESH WATER EEL.

81
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,705
ALL RIGHT, MAYBE IT MEANS THAT, TOO.

82
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,207
OH, I WOULD KILL

83
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,210
FOR A SALMON SKIN ROLL RIGHT NOW.

84
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,712
YOU KNOW, FINE, GET ATTACKED; I DON'T EVEN CARE.

85
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,713

86
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,715
COME ON, ROSS. WE'RE SORRY.

87
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,717
PLEASE TELL US WHAT IT IS.

88
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:45,225
UNAGI IS A STATE  OF TOTAL AWARENESS, OKAY?

89
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:49,229
ONLY BY ACHIEVING TRUE UNAGI CAN YOU BE PREPARED

90
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,232
FOR ANY DANGER THAT MAY BEFALL YOU.

91
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,235
YOU MEAN, IN CASE SOMEONE'S TRYING TO STEAL

92
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,238
YOUR BAMBOO SLEEPING MAT OR YOUR KETTLE OF FISH?

93
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,241

94
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,244
ALL I'M SAYING IS, IT'S ONE THING BEING PREPARED

95
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,746
FOR AN ATTACK AGAINST, LIKE, EACH OTHER.

96
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,749
WHOLE ANOTHER STORY BEING PREPARED FOR AN ATTACK

97
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,251
I DON'T KNOW, LIKE, A SURPRISE!

98
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,261
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNEW THAT WAS COMING

99
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,264
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE UNAGI.

100
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,267
OOH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

101
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,768
IF WE MADE RESERVATIONS

102
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,271
WE COULD HAVE UNAGI IN ABOUT A HALF HOUR.

103
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,772
YOU KNOW WHAT...?

104
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,276
HEY, HEY, IS MONICA HERE?

105
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,277
NO. UH UH.

106
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,778
LOOK, I NEED YOUR HELP-- I DON'T KNOW

107
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,780
WHAT TO GET HER FOR VALENTINE'S DAY.

108
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,283
WELL, VALENTINE'S DAY WAS TWO WEEKS AGO

109
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,785
SO I WOULDN'T GET HER A CALENDAR.

110
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,786

111
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,288
SHE WAS WORKING ON VALENTINE'S DAY

112
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,789
SO WE'RE CELEBRATING IT TONIGHT.

113
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,792
OH, HEY, WHY DON'T YOU BOOK A DAY FOR BOTH OF YOU

114
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,294
AT ONE OF THOSE ROMANTIC SPAS?

115
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,796
OOH, JOEY, THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD IDEA.

116
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,299
YEAH, AND, OF COURSE, CROTCHLESS PANTIES.

117
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,303
WELL, AS APPEALING

118
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,305
AS THAT DOES SOUND TO HER BOYFRIEND...

119
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,806
AND HER BROTHER...

120
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,311
I CAN'T DO THAT.

121
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,813
WE PROMISED WE'D MAKE EACH OTHER GIFTS THIS YEAR.

122
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,315
OH, I LOVE THAT. YOU GUYS!

123
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,816
YOU CAN'T MAKE CROTCHLESS PANTIES?

124
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,817
YOU TAKE...

125
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,321
YOU TAKE A PAIR OF SCISSORS AND JUST CUT THE...

126
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,323
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!

127
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,825
SO, MAKING THINGS-- THAT SOUNDS SO MUCH FUN.

128
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,327
YEAH, I THOUGHT SO, TOO

129
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,329
UNTIL I PAPIER MACHE'D ONE OF MY EYES SHUT.

130
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,830
I LOVE PAPIER MACHE.

131
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,332
WHAT DID YOU MAKE?

132
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,334
I MADE A .

133
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,336
WHAT IS THAT?

134
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,837
OH. NOTHING!

135
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,341
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

136
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,842
WELL, HAVE YOU GUYS MADE ANYTHING

137
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,344
THAT MAYBE I COULD TAKE CREDIT FOR?

138
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,345
OOH, I HAVE. I HAVE.

139
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,847
UM, I STARTED MAKING THESE LITTLE SOCK BUNNIES.

140
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,349
OH, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

141
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,350
LOOK.

142
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,852
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

143
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,354
THAT IS MY SOCK.

144
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,857
NOW IT'S YOUR LITTLE BUNNY FRIEND.

145
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,859

146
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,370
OKAY.

147
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,378
THIS... THIS ACTUALLY IS A .

148
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,879
HEY!

149
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,880
HEY.

150
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,382
HONEY, CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION

151
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,883
ABOUT THE VALENTINE'S DAY GIFTS?

152
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,884
OH, YEAH.

153
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,386
DO WE HAVE TO MAKE THE ENTIRE THING?

154
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,387
YES.

155
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,389
WHY, DID YOU FORGET TO MAKE YOURS?

156
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,392
OF COURSE... OF COURSE NOT.

157
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,893
I JUST HAVE TO, UH...

158
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,896
GO OVER TO THE PLACE WHERE I MADE IT AND PICK IT UP.

159
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,398
OKAY. I CAN'T WAIT.

160
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,900
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BEST VALENTINE'S DAY EVER.

161
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,901

162
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,904
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

163
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,905
MAKE THE PRESENTS!

164
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,407
MAKE THE PRESENTS!

165
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,908
WHAT?

166
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,911
I'M JUST SO EXCITED TO MAKE THE PRESENTS!

167
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,913

168
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,417
SHOOT!

169
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,422
HI. UH, I'M JOEY TRIBBIANI

170
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,923
AND, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT

171
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,425
I'D LIKE TO DONATE SOME FLUIDS.

172
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,929
WE'RE ACTUALLY AT THE END OF ONE OF OUR RESEARCH CYCLES

173
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,931
SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR APPLICANTS RIGHT NOW.

174
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,934
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD; I KIND OF BEEN SAVING UP.

175
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,439
UH... ARE YOU SURE

176
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,941
THERE'S NO STUDIES I COULD PARTICIPATE IN?

177
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,943
WELL, HERE'S A SCHEDULE OF WHAT'S COMING UP.

178
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,445
AH, THANKS.

179
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,946
BUT THIS ONE STARTS NOW.

180
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,449
OH, THAT ONE IS AVAILABLE NOW

181
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,951
BUT ONLY IDENTICAL TWINS ARE ELIGIBLE; IT'S A TWIN STUDY.

182
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,953
BUT IT'S $2,000 DOLLARS.

183
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,455
SORRY.

184
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,457
OH.

185
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,459
AND, WELL, HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

186
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,961
"TESTING THE EFFECTS OF JOEY TRIBBIANI

187
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,963
ON ATTRACTIVE NURSE RECEPTIONIST."

188
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,966
WE ALREADY GOT THE RESULTS BACK ON THAT ONE

189
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,968
AND THEY'RE NOT GOOD.

190
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,474
...BUT IT WAS GOOD.

191
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,975
THOSE LAST MOVES WERE...

192
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,977
DANGER! DANGER!

193
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,479
ROSS!

194
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,984
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!

195
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,988
A LESSON IN THE IMPORTANCE OF UNAGI.

196
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,491
OH!

197
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,493
YOU'RE A FREAK!

198
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,495
PERHAPS.

199
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,498
NOW, I'M CURIOUS--

200
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,501
AT WHAT POINT DURING THOSE GIRLISH SCREAMS

201
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,003
WOULD YOU HAVE BEGUN TO "KICK MY ASS"?

202
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,008
ALL RIGHT, SO WE WEREN'T PREPARED.

203
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,010
I'M SORRY I HAD TO TAKE

204
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,013
SUCH DRASTIC MEASURES TO MAKE MY POINT

205
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,015
BUT, LOOK, I JUST WANT YOU GUYS TO BE SAFE.

206
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,016
OH. OH.

207
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,018
DANGER!

208
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,024
UH HUH.

209
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,527
UNAGI.

210
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,035
2,000 BUCKS IS A LOT OF MONEY.

211
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,538
BOY, I WISH I HAD A TWIN.

212
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,040
WHERE COULD I FIND SOMEONE...

213
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,544
WHO LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE ME?

214
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,065
HEY.

215
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,567
CHANDLER...

216
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,571
I SENSED IT WAS YOU.

217
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,574
WHAT?

218
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,077
UNAGI.

219
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,079
I'M ALWAYS AWARE.

220
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,583
OKAY, ARE YOU AWARE THAT UNAGI IS AN EEL?

221
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,085
WHAT'S UP?

222
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,087
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT TO MAKE MONICA.

223
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,589
WHY NOT MAKE HER ONE OF YOUR LITTLE JOKES?

224
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,090
I'M GOING CRAZY, OKAY?

225
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,593
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING AROUND HERE

226
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,594
THAT LOOKS HOMEMADE?

227
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,095
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

228
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,097
SHE'D LOVE THIS.

229
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,099
IT'S AN EXACT REPLICA OF APOLLO EIGHT.

230
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,101
I MADE IT IN THE SIXTH GRADE.

231
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,603
YEAH, I GUESS I COULD USE THAT.

232
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,105
I COULD SAY, "YOUR LOVE SENDS ME TO THE MOON."

233
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,106
YEAH, YEAH.

234
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,610
EXCEPT APOLLO EIGHT DIDN'T ACTUALLY LAND ON THE MOON.

235
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,111
BUT YOU COULD WRITE

236
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,614
"YOUR LOVE LETS ME ORBIT THE MOON TWICE

237
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,616
AND RETURN SAFELY."

238
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,617
WAIT A MINUTE.

239
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,118
I CAN'T GIVE THIS TO HER.

240
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,620
WHY NOT?

241
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,622
BECAUSE IT SAYS "CAPTAIN ROSS" ON THE SIDE...

242
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,125
AND IT SAYS "I HATE MONICA" ON THE BOTTOM.

243
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,126
MM HMM.

244
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,131
DANGER! DANGER!

245
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,133

246
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,140
AH...

247
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,643
SALMON SKIN ROLL.

248
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,148
OKAY... OKAY...

249
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,165
YES, HONEY, I'VE MADE IT MYSELF.

250
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,681
I CAN'T DO IT. I CAN'T DO IT.

251
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,185
OH! OH!

252
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,187
A MIX TAPE! A MIX TAPE!

253
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,691
OKAY, HI.

254
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,192
UH, YOU READY TO EXCHANGE GIFTS?

255
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,193
SURE.

256
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,695
OKAY, YOU GO FIRST.

257
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,196
OKAY, COME HERE. COME HERE.

258
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,698
OKAY. NOW, IT'S NOT WRAPPED

259
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,199
BECAUSE I JUST, JUST FINISHED IT.

260
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,200
OKAY.

261
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,202
BUT I MADE YOU A TAPE

262
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,204
OF WHAT I THINK ARE ALL ROMANTIC SONGS.

263
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,706

264
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,708
WHAT A GREAT GIFT.

265
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,712
IS "THE WAY YOU LOOK TONIGHT" ON IT?

266
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,718
MAYBE. WE'LL HAVE TO LISTEN AND SEE.

267
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,719
OH, I LOVE IT.

268
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,220
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

269
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,722
OKAY.

270
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,723
OKAY.

271
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,724
YOU READY TO OPEN YOURS?

272
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,225
YEAH. OKAY.

273
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,739
IT'S A SOCK BUNNY.

274
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,742
YEAH, YEAH, YOU REMEMBER HOW I CALL YOU "BUNNY"?

275
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,244
NOT REALLY.

276
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,246
WELL, I DID ONE TIME

277
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,749
AND I WANT TO START DOING IT MORE.

278
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,752
SEE, THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. I SEE.

279
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,755
YOU KNOW, UM... PHOEBE MAKES SOCK BUNNIES.

280
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,756
NO. NO, SHE DOESN'T.

281
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,758
PHOEBE, WHAT SHE MAKES, THEY'RE SOCK RABBITS.

282
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,259
THEY'RE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

283
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,261
OKAY! OKAY!

284
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,262
OKAY

285
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,263
I DIDN'T MAKE IT.

286
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,765
I'M SORRY. I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT TONIGHT

287
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,267
AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE THE PRESENTS.

288
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,769
OH, IT'S OKAY. I DON'T, I...

289
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,270
NO, NO, IT'S NOT OKAY. IT'S NOT.

290
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,773
I MEAN, YOU WERE JUST... YOU'RE SO INCREDIBLE.

291
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,275
YOU WENT THROUGH ALL THIS TIME AND EFFORT TO MAKE

292
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,778
THIS TAPE FOR ME; YOU KNOW, I'M JUST GOING TO...

293
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,782
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THIS UP TO YOU-- I WILL.

294
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,285
I AM GOING TO... COOK YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT IN HERE

295
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,789
AND I'M GOING TO DO ANYTHING YOU WANT IN THERE.

296
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,794
WELL, I DID PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO THE TAPE.

297
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,804
WOW.

298
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,309
YOU ARE WAY TOO YOUNG TO HAVE SEEN THAT.

299
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,814
YOU KNOW, YOUR BIRTHDAY'S IN A MONTH AND A HALF.

300
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,815
WHAT DO YOU SAY

301
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,317
I FORGET TO GET YOU A PRESENT FOR THAT, TOO?

302
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:42,321
YOU ARE TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY 100% PERCENT FORGIVEN.

303
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,823
WE HAVE GOT TO WASH THAT.

304
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,324
YEAH.

305
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,328
HEY.

306
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,831
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT JACKET THAT YOU LOVED SO MUCH

307
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,332
THAT YOU THOUGHT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE?

308
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,334
YOU HAVE DONE ENOUGH.

309
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,337
I'M GOING TO WAKE UP EARLY AND GO GET IT FOR YOU.

310
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,339
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE...  GET IT IN BLACK, NOT BROWN.

311
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,841

312
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,343
OOP! YOUR CAKE IS READY.

313
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,344
OOP.

314
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,849
WELL, IT'S LIKE THAT OLD SAYING--

315
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,852
"HAVE SEX, EAT SOME CAKE."

316
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,356
HEY, MON. HEY, CHAN.

317
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,858
JUST GETTING A SODA.

318
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,364
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

319
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,366
I'M JOEY.

320
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,870
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

321
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,374
NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!

322
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,876
HOW YOU DOING?

323
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,378
HOW YOU DOING?

324
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,380
DAMN IT, CARL. GO WAIT IN THE HALL.

325
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,386
LOOK.

326
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,889
I'VE GOT TO APOLOGIZE ON BEHALF OF CARL.

327
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,391
WHO THE HELL IS CARL?!

328
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,393
OH, DID I NOT MENTION?

329
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,895
CARL

330
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,397
IS A GUY I HIRED TO BE MY IDENTICAL TWIN

331
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,399
FOR A MEDICAL RESEARCH PROJECT.

332
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,404
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THE GOOD IDEAS ARE

333
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,907
JUST RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, AREN'T THEY?

334
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,409
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT I THINK IT MIGHT WORK.

335
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,912
BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM IS, CARL'S ACTING IS...

336
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,414
THE ONLY PROBLEM?

337
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,916
YEAH. HE'S THE REASON I DIDN'T GET

338
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,417
THAT BIG MINUTE MAID COMMERCIAL

339
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,919
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, REMEMBER?

340
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,421
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE BROTHERS, BUT HE MESSED IT UP.

341
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,923
HEY.

342
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,925
UH, CAN I GET A LITTLE PIECE OF THAT CAKE?

343
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,927
PIZZA! WE LIKE PIZZA!

344
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:28,928
GET OUT!

345
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,437
PAT SAJAK?

346
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,438
YEAH.

347
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,439
ALEX TREBEK?

348
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,440
OH, OF COURSE.

349
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,442
CHUCK WOOLERY.

350
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,443
DEFINITELY, PHOEBE.

351
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,446
YOU WILL NOT FIND A SINGLE GAME SHOW HOST

352
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,448
WHOSE ASS I CANNOT KICK.

353
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,457

354
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,458
SAY IT!

355
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,960
SAY "WE ARE UNAGI."

356
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,965
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU ARE; IT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE.

357
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,967
SAY IT!

358
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,969
YOU KNOW, I COULD EASILY GET OUT OF THIS

359
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,973
BUT THERE'S A CHANCE YOU COULD GET VERY, VERY HURT.

360
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,476

361
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,486
ALL RIGHT, CARL, WE'RE NEXT.

362
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,487
NOW REMEMBER

363
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,989
WHAT IS THIS NOT GOING TO BE?

364
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,491
ANOTHER MINUTE MAID FIASCO.

365
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,492
THAT'S RIGHT.

366
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,494
AND WHAT ARE YOU NOT GOING TO DO?

367
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,996
I'M NOT GOING TO TALK BECAUSE...

368
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,998
THAT... DAMN IT, CARL!

369
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,500

370
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,004
CAN I HAVE THE NEXT ONE, PLEASE?

371
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,506
THANK YOU.

372
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,508
JOEY AND TONY TRIBBIANI.

373
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,509
THAT'S US.

374
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,011
BUT, UH...

375
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,513
THIS IS A STUDY FOR IDENTICAL TWINS.

376
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:58,017
THAT'S RIGHT-- $2,000 DOLLARS.

377
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,519
BUT YOU'RE NOT IDENTICAL TWINS.

378
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,524
DAMN IT, CARL!

379
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,033
OH, MY GOOD GOD.

380
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:18,037
OKAY, CONTINUING THE COUNTDOWN

381
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,039
OF YOUR FAVORITE MEALS.

382
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,042
TONIGHT, NUMBER THREE:

383
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,545
MACARONI AND CHEESE WITH CUT UP HOT DOGS.

384
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,049
LOOK, YOU HAVE DONE ENOUGH, OKAY?

385
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,051
YOU HAVE TO STOP THIS NOW.

386
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,053
I WILL, BUT NOT TONIGHT.

387
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,554
AND FOR DINNER MUSIC, I THOUGHT

388
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,557
WE COULD LISTEN TO THAT TAPE THAT YOU MADE ME.

389
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,559
OH, THE MIX TAPE.

390
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,565
?
Tony  ?? When I'm awfully low... ?

391
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,071
"THE WAY YOU LOOK TONIGHT" IS ON HERE.

392
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,572
DANCE WITH ME?

393
00:17:53,572 --> 00:18:03,082
?? I will feel a glow just thinking of you ??

394
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:08,587
?? And the way you look tonight. ??

395
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,094
YOU ARE JUST THE SWEETEST...

396
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,598
 I love the way you look

397
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,101
every night, Chandler.

398
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,607
That's why I made you this tape.

399
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,110
Happy Birthday!

400
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,112
Love, Janice.

401
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,113

402
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,120
NO, YOU'RE THE SWEETEST...

403
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,629
OKAY, LADIES, THAT ENDS TODAY'S CLASS, AND LET'S REMEMBER--

404
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,131
LET'S BE SAFE OUT THERE.

405
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,139
IT'S A GREAT CLASS.

406
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,140
THANKS, MAN.

407
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,142
YEAH, YEAH, I WAS WATCHING.

408
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,647
UM, HEY, A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS, THOUGH.

409
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,649
UM, YOU KNOW, ABOUT THAT LAST MOVE

410
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,652
WHERE THAT WOMAN TRIPPED YOU AND THEN PINNED YOU

411
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,653
TO THE FLOOR?

412
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,155
WHAT WOULD YOU DO NEXT?

413
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,657
WELL, THEN SHE'D TAKE HER KEYS AND TRY TO JAM THEM...

414
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,161
NO, NO. WHAT WOULD YOU DO NEXT?

415
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,163
WHO, ME, THE ATTACKER?

416
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,664
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

417
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,166
WHY?

418
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,168
I TRIED ATTACKING TWO WOMEN.

419
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,170
DID NOT WORK.

420
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,171
WHAT?

421
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,672
NO, I MEAN, IT'S OKAY.

422
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,174
I MEAN, THEY'RE MY FRIENDS.

423
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,177
IN FACT, I WAS MARRIED TO ONE OF THEM.

424
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,178
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

425
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,180
YOU ATTACKED YOUR EX WIFE?

426
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,682
OH, NO, NO, NO.

427
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,185
I TRIED

428
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,686
BUT I COULDN'T.

429
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,688
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

430
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,692
MAYBE WE COULD ATTACK THEM TOGETHER.

431
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,696
THAT'S A "NO."

432
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:03,202
I AM SO, SO, SO, SO SORRY.

433
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,204
UH HUH.

434
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,709
OH! AND I WILL COOK ANYTHING YOU WANT IN HERE

435
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,713
AND DO ANYTHING YOU WANT IN THERE.

436
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,717
YEAH, YOU WILL, AND ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

437
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,723
COME ON, MONICA, IT'S OUR VALENTINE'S DAY.

438
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,725
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE?

439
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,229
OKAY.

440
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,730
OKAY?

441
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:42,241
 ?? My funny valentine ??

442
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,244
?
?? Sweet, comic valentine... ?

443
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,246
SO ARE WE GOING IN THERE?

444
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,248
I AM.

445
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,255
?
?? Your looks are laughable... ?

446
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,762
AHA.

447
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,765
NOWHERE TO RUN.

448
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,769
I DON'T LIKE SITTING UP HERE.

449
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,271
I'M GOING OVER THERE.

450
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,772
NO, RACHEL. THEY GOT HERE FIRST.

451
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,781
WHAT?

452
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,283
WHY IS ROSS DOING THAT?

453
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,784
 DANGER!

454
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,785
OH, MY GOD!

455
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,788
WHY IS HE JUMPING ON THOSE WOMEN?

456
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,292
WE SHOULD HELP THEM.

457
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,295
I... I DON'T THINK THEY NEED ANY HELP.
