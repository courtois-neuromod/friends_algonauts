1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,004
SO, SEEMS LIKE

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,506
THIS INTERNET THING IS HERE TO STAY, HUH?

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,010
IT'S OKAY NOT TO TALK.

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,512
HEY, GUYS, GUESS WHAT?

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,015
BARRY AND MINDY ARE GETTING A DIVORCE.

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,017

7
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,519
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?!

8
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,523
NO-- BARRY AND MINDY.

9
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,025
OH. SORRY.

10
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,527
I HEAR DIVORCE, I IMMEDIATELY GO TO ROSS.

11
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,530
WHO WHO'S BARRY AND MINDY?

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,532
BARRY WAS THE GUY THAT I ALMOST MARRIED

13
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,034
AND MINDY WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

14
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,535
OH. WASN'T HE CHEATING ON YOU WITH HER?

15
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,037
YEAH, BUT THAT JUST MEANS

16
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,539
THAT HE WAS FALLING ASLEEP ON TOP OF HER INSTEAD OF ME.

17
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,540
AH.

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,042
WHY DID THEY GET DIVORCED?

19
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,544
WELL, APPARENTLY, SHE CAUGHT HIM CHEATING ON HER

20
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,046
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

21
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,049
ISN'T THAT SAD?

22
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,552
GOD, COULD YOU IMAGINE IF I'D ACTUALLY MARRIED HIM?

23
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,054
HOW DIFFERENT WOULD MY LIFE BE?

24
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,555
 I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

25
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,557
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW DIFFERENT MY LIFE WOULD BE

26
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,059
IF I'D NEVER GOTTEN DIVORCED.

27
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,061
WHICH TIME? THE FIRST TIME.

28
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,563
NO, SERIOUSLY, IMAGINE IF CAROL

29
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,565
HADN'T REALIZED SHE WAS A LESBIAN.

30
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,069
I CAN'T.

31
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,571
I KEEP SEEING IT THE GOOD WAY.

32
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:16,076
I BET I'D STILL BE DOING MY KARA TE.

33
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:21,081
TOWARDS THE END OF OUR MARRIAGE, I WAS DOING A LOT OF KARA TE

34
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,083
AS A WAY OF RELEASING THE TENSION

35
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,086
FROM, YOU KNOW, NOT DOING ANYTHING ELSE PHYSICAL.

36
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,087
MAYBE THE PROBLEM WAS

37
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,588
YOU WERE PRONOUNCING IT "KARA TE."

38
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,591
WHAT IF I WAS STILL FAT?

39
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,594
Y YOU WOULDN'T BE DATING ME, THAT'S FOR SURE.

40
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,096
SURE I WOULD.

41
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,597
OH, YEAH. OH, COME ON.

42
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,100
WHAT? YOU GUYS REALLY THINK I'M THAT SHALLOW?

43
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,102
NO, I JUST THINK MONICA WAS THAT FAT.

44
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,606
HEY, IMAGINE IF I'D NEVER GOT FIRED

45
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,108
OFF DAYS OF OUR LIVES.

46
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,110
HEY, HEY, THERE'S CAROL AGAIN.

47
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,614
WHAT IF I HAD HAD THE GUTS TO QUIT MY JOB?

48
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,616
I'D PROBABLY BE WRITING FOR THE NEW YORKER--

49
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,618
BEING PAID TO BE FUNNY.

50
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,620
BUT MY JOB'S FUN, TOO.

51
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,125
I MEAN... TOMORROW, I... I DON'T HAVE TO WEAR A TIE.

52
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,627
WHAT IF I HAD TAKEN THAT JOB AT MERRILL LYNCH?

53
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,628
WHAT? WHAT?

54
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,130
MERRILL LYNCH?

55
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,132
YEAH. I HAD A MASSAGE CLIENT WHO WORKED THERE

56
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,134
AND HE SAID I HAD A KNACK FOR STOCKS.

57
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,635
WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE THE JOB?

58
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,137
BECAUSE AT THAT TIME, YOU SEE

59
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,140
I THOUGHT THAT EVERYTHING THAT RHYMED WAS TRUE.

60
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,642
SO, I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, IF I WORKED WITH STOCKS

61
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,145
I'D HAVE TO LIVE IN A BOX AND ONLY EAT LOX

62
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,146
AND HAVE A PET FOX...

63
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,149
YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT THAT IN A BROKER.

64
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,154
HEY, DO YOU GUYS THINK IF ALL THOSE THINGS HAPPENED

65
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,655
WE'D STILL HANG OUT?

79
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,720
OH, MY GOD. RACHEL GREEN?

80
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,721

81
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,722
ROB TILLMAN.

82
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:43,723
NO...

83
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,225

84
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,226
NO, NO, IT'S ME, ROSS.

85
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,729
OH! I'M SORRY-- ROSS TILLMAN. OH!

86
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,731
NO. NO, NO.

87
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,233
ROSS GELLER.

88
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,234
OH, OF COURSE!

89
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,735
MONICA'S BROTHER!

90
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,237
YEAH, RIGHT.

91
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,738
WOW! HOW ARE YOU?!

92
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,740
GOOD. GOO... I'M, I'M MARRIED.

93
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,741
OH. ME, TOO.

94
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,243
OH. WELL, OH...

95
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,244
ISN'T IT THE BEST?

96
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,746
OH, IT'S THE BEST.

97
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,248

98
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,749
SO, UM, HOW'S MONICA?

99
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,251
OH, REALLY, REALLY GREAT.

100
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,753
ACTUALLY, SHE'S RIGHT DOWN THE STREET.

101
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,755
UM, DO YOU...? YOU KNOW WHAT?

102
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,757
YOU SHOULD STOP BY AND SAY HI.

103
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,259
OH, I WOULD LOVE TO.

104
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,760
OH, OH, SHE'D BE SO EXCITED.

105
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,262
OH, OKAY. COME ON.

106
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,765
WAIT. DON'T YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR YOUR... BUSTY LADIES?

107
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,270
NO, NO, NO, T THAT'S OKAY.

108
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,273
SOME, SOME KID ASKED ME TO PICK IT UP FOR HIM

109
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,274
BUT I...

110
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,275
OH, OKAY.

111
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,776
OKAY.

112
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,779
DON'T YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM HIS MONEY BACK?

113
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,782
UH HUH. OH.

114
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,284
HEY, HERE YOU GO, BUDDY.

115
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,785
SORRY, NO PORN FOR YOU.

116
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,787
OKAY, LET'S GO SEE MONICA.

117
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,296
SO, MONICA

118
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,798
STILL GOING OUT WITH DR. BORING, HUH?

119
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,301
HE'S NOT BORING.

120
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,802
HE'S JUST...

121
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,806
HE'S JUST LOW KEY.

122
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,308
HERE WE GO.

123
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,309
ONE HAZELNUT LATTE.

124
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,310
THANK YOU.

125
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,311
YOU KNOW

126
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,315
THE HAZELNUT-- ACTUALLY NOT A NUT.

127
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,317
IT'S A SEED.

128
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,819
WOW.

129
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,322
CAN ANYONE ELSE NAME A WELL KNOWN SEED

130
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,824
THAT'S BEEN MASQUERADING AS A NUT?

131
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,827
OH, DEAR GOD, LET ME THINK.

132
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,329
HEY.

133
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,330
 HEY.

134
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,332
OH, NO. WHAT'S THE MATTER?

135
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,334
I JUST GOT ANOTHER REJECTION LETTER.

136
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,837
THEY SAID MY WRITING WAS FUNNY, JUST NOT "ARCHIE COMIC FUNNY."

137
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,339
YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?

138
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,341
I GOT TO GET BACK TO THE HOSPITAL.

139
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,342
ALL RIGHT. MMM.

140
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,843
OKAY. BYE.

141
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,345
OH, UH...

142
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,347
BY THE WAY, THE ANSWER IS...

143
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,848
THE BRAZIL NUT.

144
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,352
AH.

145
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,354
WAS HIS QUESTION "WHAT'S MORE BORING THAN HIM?"

146
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,858
AND NICE SWEATER VEST, BY THE WAY.

147
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,361
STOP IT, GUYS. HE'S SWEET.

148
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,862
YEAH, YEAH.

149
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,864
HEY, MAN, SORRY ABOUT THE ARCHIE THING.

150
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,866
YOU NEED ME TO GIVE YOU SOME MONEY?

151
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,870
HEY, I MAY HAVE NO MONEY, BUT I STILL HAVE MY PRIDE.

152
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,872
REALLY?

153
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,376
EH...

154
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,379
HEY, MAYBE JOEY DOESN'T HAVE TO GIVE YOU THE MONEY.

155
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,381
TV STARS HAVE ASSISTANTS, RIGHT?

156
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,382
THAT'S AN IDEA.

157
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,885
HEY, IF I HIRED AN ASSISTANT, WOULD YOU TAKE MONEY FROM HER?

158
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,387
NO, JOEY.

159
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,888
CHANDLER COULD BE YOUR ASSISTANT.

160
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,391
SEE, HE COULD ANSWER ALL YOUR FAN MAIL AND STUFF.

161
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,892
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

162
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,893
LET'S DO THAT.

163
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,895
THE MONEY COULD GIVE ME TIME TO WRITE.

164
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,397
ALL RIGHT, GREAT. WELCOME ABOARD.

165
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,398
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

166
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,399
I NEED TO USE THE BATHROOM

167
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,401
AND SINCE I DON'T NEED ASSISTANCE IN THERE

168
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,403
TAKE A BREAK!

169
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,904
ALL RIGHT.

170
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,407
HEY.

171
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,408
 HEY, PHOEBE.

172
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,409
GUESS WHAT? WHAT?

173
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,911
JOEY JUST HIRED CHANDLER TO BE HIS ASSISTANT.

174
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,912
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.

175
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,913

176
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,914
OH! HANG ON!

177
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,917
HANG ON!

178
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,920

179
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,922
GO.

180
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,424
NO. NO, NO.

181
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,926
I SAID SELL WHEN IT HITS 50.

182
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,428
FIVE-"O". IT'S A NUMBER.

183
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,430
IT COMES AFTER FOUR NINE.

184
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,432
OH, IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

185
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,434
YOU'RE ALLOWED ONE MISTAKE.

186
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,435
JUST KIDDING.

187
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,436
YOU ARE, OF COURSE, FIRED.

188
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,440
OH...!

189
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,941
AW, WHAT A SHAME.

190
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,943
I REALLY LIKED HER.

191
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,445
HEY, MON. MON.

192
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,447
LOOK WHO I RAN INTO.

193
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,449
OH, MY GOD! RACHEL!

194
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,454
GOSH, YOU LOOK TERRIFIC!

195
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,955
OH, SO DO YOU!

196
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,957

197
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,958
DID YOU LOSE WEIGHT?

198
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,960
YOU'RE SO SWEET TO NOTICE!

199
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,962
YES, I LOST THREE AND A HALF POUNDS!

200
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:43,963
AH!

201
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,466

202
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,968
AND, UH, YOU REMEMBER MY FRIEND CHANDLER.

203
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,971
AND, UH, AND THAT'S PHOEBE OVER THERE.

204
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,473
OH, MY GOD! SIT DOWN.

205
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,975
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER?

206
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,477
1987--

207
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,978
THE DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS.

208
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,979
SHAUN McMAHAN'S PARTY.

209
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,481
I PLAYED YOU ONE OF MY SONGS--

210
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,482
YOU KNOW, UH

211
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,484
"INTERPLANETARY COURTSHIP RITUAL."

212
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,487
OH, YEAH.

213
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:08,988
RIGHT.

214
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,990
SO, UH, DO YOU STILL DO MUSIC?

215
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,991
WELL, SOMETIMES.

216
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,992
YOU SHOULD COME OVER.

217
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,993
I'LL PLAY YOU ONE OF MY...

218
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,495
OH, MY GOD!

219
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,998
JOEY TRIBBIANI FROM DAYS OF OUR LIVES

220
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,501
JUST WALKED IN HERE.

221
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,502
RACH, HE'S A FRIEND OF OURS.

222
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,505
YOU ARE FRIENDS WITH DR. DRAKE RAMORAY?

223
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,507
MM HMM.

224
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,009
WELL, IT'S KIND OF HARD TO BE FRIENDS WITH DRAKE

225
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,012
BECAUSE OF HIS BUSY SCHEDULE, AND THE FACT THAT HE'S NOT REAL.

226
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:38,017
HEY, HEY, OR I COULD BRING MY KEYBOARD HERE SOMETIME.

227
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,019
HE'S COMING OVER, HE'S COMING OVER.

228
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,521
JOEY... I KNOW. HERE, HERE.

229
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,022
OH...!

230
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,524
NO.

231
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,025
THIS IS MY FRIEND, RACHEL.

232
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,027
WE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER.

233
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,028

234
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,029
HI. HI!

235
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,533
I LOVE YOU ON THAT SHOW!

236
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,534
OH...

237
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,035
I WATCH YOU EVERY DAY.

238
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,538
I MEAN, WHEN YOU TOOK OUT YOUR OWN KIDNEY

239
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,539
TO SAVE YOUR EX WIFE

240
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,041
EVEN THOUGH SHE TRIED TO KILL YOU...

241
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,544
WELL, IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO MEET THE FANS.

242
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,545
AH...!

243
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,046
SHE'S NOT CRAZY, IS SHE?

244
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,548
NO, SHE'S COOL.

245
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,549
SO, UH...

246
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,551
HOW YOU DOING?

247
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,553

248
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,058

249
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,560
HANG ON.

250
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,562
HANG ON.

251
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,565
HANG ON.

252
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,066
GO.

253
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,568
WHO IS THIS?

254
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,570
OH, OKAY. YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE WORKING FOR ME.

255
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,071
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

256
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,574
WHAT KIND OF NAME IS BRINDY?

257
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:38,077
I... WHATEVE... STOP TALKING.

258
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,081
ALL RIGHT, FROM NOW ON, YOUR NAME IS JOAN.

259
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,083
YOU CAN PICK YOUR OWN LAST NAME.

260
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,588
I CAN'T FIND MY PEN. DID YOU EAT THAT, TOO?

261
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,592
HEY, THERE YOU ARE.

262
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,093
UH OH, IT'S MY BOSS.

263
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,596
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S A LIST OF THINGS

264
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,597
FOR YOU TO DO TODAY.

265
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,098
MAN, THIS IS GOING TO BE SO GREAT.

266
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,099
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

267
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,101
I GOT TO GO TO WORK.

268
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,604
I'M DELIVERING TWINS TODAY, BUT ONLY ONE OF THEM... IS MINE.

269
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,605

270
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,108

271
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:14,113
"DROP OFF MY DRY CLEANING, PICK UP MY VITAMINS...

272
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,115
"TEACH ME HOW TO SPELL VITAMINS...

273
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,119
WEAR IN MY NEW JEANS."

274
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,623
YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU ARE, DON'T YOU?

275
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,125
WHAT? YOU'RE HIS BITCH.

276
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,628
 NO! NO!

277
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,129
NO!

278
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,632
WAIT. YOU DIDN'T JUST SIT ON MY KIT KATS, DID YOU?

279
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:36,135
NO. THERE WAS A LITTLE, LITTLE DIP IN THE MARKET

280
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,638
AND I LOST $13 MILLION DOLLARS.

281
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,641
BUT THE KIT KATS ARE ALL RIGHT?

282
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,643
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?!

283
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,645
I CAN'T CALL MY OFFICE-- THEY'LL KILL ME.

284
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,147
I CAN'T CALL MY CLIENTS-- THEY'LL KILL THEMSELVES.

285
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,649
GREAT. NOW MY CHEST HURTS.

286
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,650
WHAT?

287
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,652
MY CHEST HURTS.

288
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,153
OH...

289
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,655
YEAH, AND NOW I, I CAN'T BREATHE.

290
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,157
ARE YOU HAVING A HEART ATTACK?

291
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,160
IF I WERE, WOULD I HAVE SHOOTING PAINS UP AND DOWN MY LEFT ARM?

292
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,662
YES.

293
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,164
THEN, YES, THAT IS WHAT I'M HAVING.

294
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,666
OH, MY GOD!

295
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,670
OKAY, YEAH.

296
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,172
OKAY, THIS THIS THING IS USELESS

297
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,174
SO, WILL YOU DIAL 9-1-1 FOR ME?

298
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,179
COME ON, PHEEBS, IT'S NOT

299
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,180
THAT BAD.

300
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,181
MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE EXCITED

301
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,183
IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

302
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,686
MOST PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THEIR JOBS.

303
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,687
I LOVE MY JOB.

304
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,189
I'VE BEEN NOT WORKING FOR THREE HOURS

305
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,691
AND I'M ALREADY GOING CRAZY.

306
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,693
I MISS JOAN.

307
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,196
HONEY, HAVING A HEART ATTACK IS NATURE'S WAY OF TELLING YOU

308
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,698
TO SLOW IT DOWN.

309
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,700
I ALWAYS THOUGHT HAVING A HEART ATTACK

310
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,702
WAS NATURE'S WAY OF TELLING YOU TO DIE.

311
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,205
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DIE.

312
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,207
I MEAN, YOU ARE GOING TO DIE

313
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,209
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DIE TODAY.

314
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,711
I WISH I WAS DEAD.

315
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,714
LET'S TAKE A WALK.

316
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,716
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER WRITING

317
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,718
FOR TALKING OUT OF YOUR ASS MAGAZINE.

318
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,223
SO, WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

319
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:09,228
WELL, UM, I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT MORE OF MY KARA TE.

320
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,232
STILL GOING THROUGH THAT DRY SPELL WITH CAROL?

321
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,233
YEAH.

322
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,735
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE YOU'VE HAD SEX?

323
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,237
WELL... LAST WEEKEND...

324
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,239
OH, THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

325
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,241
...WILL BE TWO MONTHS...

326
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,745
SINCE I STOPPED TRYING.

327
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,247
MAYBE YOU NEED TO SPICE THINGS UP A LITTLE.

328
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,249
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I DON'T KNOW.

329
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,251
YOU COULD TIE HER UP, SHE COULD TIE YOU UP

330
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,753
YOU COULD EAT STUFF OFF EACH OTHER.

331
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,754
HUH.

332
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,757
YOU KNOW, DIRTY TALK, MENAGE A TROIS, TOYS...

333
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,758
WOW.

334
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,760
ROLE PLAYING.

335
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,762
YOU COULD BE THE WARDEN, SHE COULD BE THE PRISONER

336
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,764
YOU COULD BE THE PIRATE, SHE COULD BE THE WENCH...

337
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,765
OKAY, I THINK I GOT IT.

338
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,767
OR YOU COULD BE TWO STOCK BROKERS

339
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:52,271
AND YOU'RE ROLLING AROUND NAKED ON THE TRADING FLOOR, AND EVERYBODY'S WATCHING.

340
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,775
IT NEVER HAPPENED.

341
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,285
SORRY.

342
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,287
SO, HOW'S IT GOING WITH JOEY?

343
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,288
OH, JUST GREAT.

344
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,290
HE BEEPS ME NOW, WITH CODES.

345
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,792
"ONE" IS "BRING ME FOOD."

346
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,795
"TWO" IS "I'M WITH A GIRL. BRING US FOOD."

347
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,798
"THREE" IS "I'M LOST AND I CAN'T FIND FOOD."

348
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,300
AW, SWEETIE.

349
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,303
IS THERE ANY FOOD AROUND HERE?

350
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,305
HEY.

351
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,807
IS SHE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT?

352
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,308
YEAH. SHE'S RIGHT IN THERE.

353
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,310
HEY! GO TAKE OFF THOSE PANTS.

354
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,812
THEY LOOK READY.

355
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,319
 ALL RIGHT, AND OVER THERE

356
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,822
IS BRADY'S PUB, WHERE I LIKE TO UNWIND

357
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,824
AFTER A LONG DAY OF SURGEONING.

358
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,826
WOW! OH, THIS IS SO AMAZING.

359
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,827
WHAT ELSE? WHAT ELSE?

360
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,330
WELL, THAT IS A LARGE PIECE OF TELEVISION EQUIPMENT

361
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,832
AND, UH, THAT IS AN OLD MAN.

362
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,333
HEY, OLD MAN. HI.

363
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,334
ALL RIGHTY.

364
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,837
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE HEAD BACK TO MY PLACE?

365
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,338
WELL, WELL...

366
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,341
UM, YOU KNOW, I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO

367
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,843
BUT I I SHOULDN'T.

368
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:09,348
WHY? WHY... CAN'T THE WORLD STOP TURNING...

369
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,850
JUST FOR A MOMENT?

370
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,351
JUST FOR US?

371
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,855
ISN'T THAT A LINE FROM THE SHOW?

372
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,858
UH... YEAH, BUT, UH...

373
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:23,362
I MAY HAVE SAID THOSE THINGS BEFORE, BUT...

374
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,365
I NEVER TRULY MEANT THEM...

375
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,867
UNTIL NOW.

376
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,870
THAT'S A LINE FROM THE SHOW, TOO.

377
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,873
OKAY, YOU WATCH TOO MUCH TV.

378
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,374
 HERE YOU GO, JOE.

379

00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,377
THANKS.

381
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,880
YEAH, THERE'S PULP IN THAT.

382
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,383
YEAH.

383
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,885

384
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,887
I THOUGHT WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

385
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,888
I DON'T LIKE PULP.

386
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,389
NO PULP.

387
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,891
PULP ISN'T JUICE.

388
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,892
ALL JUICE, OKAY?

389
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,393
I'M SORRY.

390
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,895
I GUESS I JUST... LIKE THE PULP.

391
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,396
OH, MY GOD, I'M SOR...

392
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,398
I AM BEING SO RUDE.

393
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,401
RACHEL, WOULD YOU LIKE A SODA, OR SOMETHING?

394
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,404
BECAUSE... BECAUSE CHANDLER WILL RUN RIGHT OUT

395
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,906

396
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,907
YEAH, WELL, SURE.

397
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,909
ICED TEA WOULD BE GREAT.

398
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,410
OKAY. ICED TEA.

399
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,916
OKAY. ANYTHING FOR YOU,SIR?

400
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,919

401
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,923
OKAY, LOOK, CHANDLER, IF THIS... IS GOING TO WORK

402
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,927
YOU HAVE GOT TO LISTEN.

403
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,431
YOU'RE GOING TO THROW THAT JUICE AT ME, AREN'T YOU?

404
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,934
IT'S NOT ALL JUICE.

405
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,943
SO, HONEY, THIS MORNING WAS FUN, HUH--

406
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,947

407
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,948
YEAH, AND MAYBE SOMEDAY

408
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,950
WE COULD GET A PLACE WITH TWO BATHROOMS.

409
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,454
LOOK, CAROL, UM...

410
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,457

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

413
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,463

HEY, WHY DON'T WE GET SOME SHOES ON YOU, HUH?

417
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,972
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU SHOW DAD HOW YOU CAN PUT YOUR SHOES ON

418
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,473
IN YOUR ROOM? YAY!

419
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,975

00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,481
I WAS THINKING MAYBE...

423
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,484
I DON'T KNOW, WE COULD TRY SOME NEW THINGS

424
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,986
YOU KNOW, FOR FUN.

425
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:27,987
LIKE WHAT?

426
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,989
WELL, I DON'T KNOW. UM...

00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,496
WELL, WHAT IF WE, UH, WERE TO...

428
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,498

429
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,502

430
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:51,510
UM, SOME PEOPLE... EAT STUFF OFF ONE ANOTHER.

431
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,013
YEAH.

432
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,516
UM, YOU KNOW, WE COULD TRY DIRTY TALK.

433
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,018

434
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:03,022
UM, WE COULD, WE COULD HAVE A THREESOME.

435
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,523
I LOVE THAT IDEA.

436
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,528
WHO SOLD A STORY TO ARCHIE COMICS?

437
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,529
OH, MY GOD!

438
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,031
THAT'S SO GREAT!

439
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,532
OH, WOW!

440
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,533
YOU'RE A PUBLISHED WRITER!

441
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,535
I WISH I HAD A PRESENT FOR YOU.

442
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,037
AW... WAIT A MINUTE.

443
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,541
MY LAST KIT KAT BAR.

444
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,048
YOU WANT TO SHARE IT?

445
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,549
OKAY! OKAY.

446
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,551
HEY. HEY.

447
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,053
OKAY, CHANDLER, LOOK

448
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,054
I KNOW YOU'RE MAD

449
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,556
BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M SORRY.

450
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,557
I WAS A TOTAL JERK.

451
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,060
COMPLETELY OVER THE LINE.

452
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,062
I JUST... I HATE PULP

453
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,064
YOU KNOW?

454
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,066
YOU KNOW HOW MONICA FEELS ABOUT LOW FAT MAYONNAISE?

455
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,568
IT'S NOT MAYONNAISE!

456
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:54,073
YEAH, OKAY, WELL, ANYWAY, I JUST WANTED TO SAY I'M SORRY

457
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,075
AND HERE.

458
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,076
WHAT'S THIS?

459
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,577
FRESH SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE

460
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,580
WITH PULP,  JUST THE WAY YOU LIKE IT.

461
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,083
OH, THANKS, MAN.

462
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,586
HEY, JOEY...

463
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,591
JOEY, CHANDLER SOLD A STORY TO ARCHIE COMICS.

464
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,593
OH, MY GOD, THAT'S GREAT! CONGRATULATIONS!

465
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,095
WHAT'S THE STORY?

466
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,596
OH, YOU WOULDN'T, UH, CARE.

467
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,598
IT'S JUST A STUPID COMIC BOOK STORY.

468
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,100
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

469
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,602
I LOVE ARCHIE, AND THE WHOLE GANG!

470
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:30,109
WELL, UM, ARCHIE NEEDS MONEY TO FIX HIS JALOPY.

471
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,112

472
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,616
UH, BUT HE DOESN'T WANT REGGIE TO JUST GIVE HIM THE MONEY...

473
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,119
SO REGGIE HIRES HIM AS HIS ASS IS...

474
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,623
AS HIS BUTLER...

475
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,126
AND THEN MAKES HIM DO ALL THESE CRAZY THINGS

476
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,629
LIKE BRING HIM MILKSHAKES THAT CAN'T HAVE LUMPS IN THEM.

477
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,632
WAIT A MINUTE.

478
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,634
THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE FAMILIAR.

479
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,139
DID THEY ALREADY DO THAT ONE, BECAUSE I THINK I READ IT.

480
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,146
LISTEN, I HAVE TO ASK.

481
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:11,150
OKAY, JOEY TRIBBIANI INVITED ME BACK TO HIS APARTMENT.

482
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,153
NOW, DOES HE DO THIS WITH A LOT OF GIRLS?

483
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,154
YEAH, A LOT.

484
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,156
A LOT, A LOT.

485
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,657
OH, AND I'M ONE OF THEM!

486
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,659
WOW!

487
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,662
OH, I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE THIS!

488
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,165
I MEAN, JOEY TRIBBIANI!

489
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,167
RACHEL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE HIS LAST NAME.

490
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,668
AW, BUT MONICA, COME ON!

491
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,171
I MEAN, IT'S JOEY TRIBBIANI!

492
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,173
I GUESS YOU HAVE TO.

493
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,674
YOU KNOW, IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS

494
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,176
BUT AREN'T YOU MARRIED?

495
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,178
YEAH.

496
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,682
OH, I WISH WE COULD JUST NOT BE MARRIED

497
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,184
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

498
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:49,188
YOU KNOW, I JUST WISH WE COULD BE, LIKE, ON A BREAK.

499
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,192
WELL, YOU'RE NOT.

500
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,193
IT'S SO EASY FOR YOU.

501
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,194
YOU'RE NOT MARRIED.

502
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,695
YOU CAN HAVE SEX WITH WHOEVER YOU WANT.

503
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,198
YEAH, I CAN.

504
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,201
AND DON'T THINK I DON'T, BECAUSE I DO.

505
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,203
ALL THE TIME, YOU BETCHA.

506
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,208
MONICA? HMM?

507
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,710
YOU'VE... YOU'VE DONE IT, RIGHT?

508
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,212

509
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,713
OF COURSE I HAVE.

510
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,715
WHAT DO YOU THINK, I'M, LIKE...

511
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,217
SOME 30 YEAR OLD VIRGIN?

512
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,718
OH, MY GOD!

513
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,221
YOU'RE A 30 YEAR- OLD VIRGIN!

514
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,722
SAY IT LOUDER.

515
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,725
I DON'T THINK THE GUY ALL THE WAY IN THE BACK HEARD YOU.

516
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,229
 YEAH, I HEARD IT.

517
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,231
IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY.

518
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,732
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, JUST...

519
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,234
I'M JUST WAITING FOR THE PERFECT GUY.

520
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,735
MM HMM.

521
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,237
I'M SEEING THIS GUY, ROGER.

522
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,738
I MEAN, HE'S NOT PERFECT, BUT, UH

523
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,741
I'M THINKING MAYBE I SHOULD JUST GET IT OVER WITH.

524
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,743
YOU KNOW, GIVE HIM MY FLOWER.

525
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,745
OH, MY GOD, DO IT.

526
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,250
HONEY, YOU'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH.

527
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,751
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU ARE RIGHT.

528
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,752
YES!

529
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,754
SEX DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A BIG DEAL.

530
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,258
THERE SHOULDN'T BE ALL THESE RULES AND RESTRICTIONS, YOU KNOW?

531
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,261
PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SLEEP WITH WHOEVER THEY WANT

532
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,762
WHENEVER... RACHEL...

533
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,264
I'M NEVER GOING TO THINK IT'S OKAY

534
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,265
FOR YOU TO CHEAT ON YOUR HUSBAND.

535
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,268
OH, WHAT DO YOU KNOW, VIRGIN?

536
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,275
PHOEBE?

537
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,278
WHY IS SMOKE COMING OUT OF THE BATHROOM?

538
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,779
OH, YEAH, THE DOCTOR SAID

539
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,282
THAT COULD BE ONE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS.

540
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,785
PHOEBE, PUT THAT CIGARETTE OUT.

541
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,787
NO, IT'S NOT A CIGARETTE.

542
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,289
THE SMOKE IS COMING OUT OF ME.

543
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,291
PUT IT OUT!

544
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,792
OKAY, OKAY!

545
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,296
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

546
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,797
COME ON.

547
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,299

548
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,800
I GOT IT. GIVE IT TO ME.

549
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,302
I GOT IT. GIVE IT!

550
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,304

551
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,808
HELLO.

552
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,810
NO, SHE CAN'T COME TO THE PHONE RIGHT NOW.

553
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,312
OH. RIGHT.

554
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,314
NO PROBLEM. OKAY, BYE BYE.

555
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,316
WAS IT MY WORK? WERE THEY MAD?

556
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,817
WAS IT JACK? DID HE YELL?

557
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,818
JUST RELAX.

558
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,819
NOBODY YELLED.
