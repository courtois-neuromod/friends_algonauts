1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,504
HEY, CHECK THIS OUT.

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,506
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS.

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,508
YES, ROSS, WE KNOW THEY HAVE MAGAZINES

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,011
WITH PICTURES OF NAKED WOMEN IN THEM.

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,013
OH, DON'T TELL HIM ABOUT THE VIDEOS

6
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,017
I MADE UP A JOKE AND SENT IT IN TO PLAYBOY.

7
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,519
THEY PRINTED IT.

8
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,523
I DIDN'T KNOW PLAYBOY PRINTS JOKES.

9
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,525
YEAH, THEY PRINT JOKES, UH, INTERVIEWS

10
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,027
HARD HITTING JOURNALISM.

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,528
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE PICTURES.

12
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,030
IT DIDN'T WORK ON MOM.

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,531
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK ON US.

14
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,532
HERE, CHECK IT OUT.

15
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,534
IT'S THE FIRST ONE, TOO.

16
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,038
RIGHT THERE.

17
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,040

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,541
THAT IS FUNNY.

19
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,543
IT WAS ALSO FUNNY WHEN I MADE IT UP.

20
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,046
WHAT?

21
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,547
I MADE THAT JOKE UP.

22
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,050
UH, OH, NO, YOU DIDN'T. I DID.

23
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,051
UH UH OH, YES, I DID.

24
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,053
I TOLD IT TO DAN AT WORK AND HE SAID IT WAS

25
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,554
THE FUNNIEST JOKE HE'D EVER HEARD.

26
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,057
HEY, TELL DAN "THANKS."

27
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,562
WHAT?

28
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,065
I'M SORRY. I WAS JUST READING THE JOKE BELOW IT.

29
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,566
MAN, THAT ONE IS FUNNY.

30
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,571
MONICA, YOU REMEMBER ME TELLING YOU THAT JOKE, RIGHT?

31
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,073
NO.

32
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,074
SERIOUSLY?

33
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,576
WELL, YOU TELL A LOT OF JOKES.

34
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,579
LOOK, CHANDLER, IT'S MY JOKE.

35
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,581
HEY, IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER

36
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,083
THEY DON'T PRINT THE NAME

37
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,585
SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHO GETS CREDIT, RIGHT?

38
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,087
YEAH, I GUESS NOT.

39
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,088
HEY, GUYS.

40
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,589
HEY, JOEY! PLAYBOY PRINTED MY JOKE!

41
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,591
NO! NO! IT'S MINE!

42
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,093
CALL THEM. THEY'LL TELL YOU.

43
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,094
IT'S MY JOKE. IT'S MY JOKE!

44
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,595
WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!

45
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,097
JOKES?

46
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,600
YOU GUYS KNOW THEY HAVE NAKED CHICKS IN THERE, RIGHT?

56
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,643
DUDE, DUDE, YOU HAVE GOT TO TURN ON BEHIND THE MUSIC.

57
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,146
THE BAND HEART IS HAVING A REALLY TOUGH TIME

58
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,647
AND I THINK THEY MAY BREAK UP.

59
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,649
HEY, LET'S GO WATCH THAT AT YOUR PLACE.

60
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,151
NO, NO, NO. MONICA'S WATCHING SOME COOKING SHOW.

61
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,153
COME ON, I DON'T WANT TO MISS WHEN THEY WERE SKINNY.

62
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,155
UH, HEY HEY, CHANDLER, CHANDLER

63
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,656
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO?

64
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,660
YOU AND I SHOULD GO OUT AND GET SOME NEW SUNGLASSES.

65
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,163
WHAT? NO. I WANT TO WATCH THIS.

66
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,666
DID YOUR CABLE GO OUT?

67
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,169
NO, NO. THAT'S VH1.

68
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,671
I GOT TO TELL YOU, THE MUSIC THESE KIDS LISTEN TO TODAY

69
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,674
IT'S LIKE A LOT OF NOISE TO ME. I DON'T KNOW.

70
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,178
JOEY, WHY IS YOUR CABLE OUT?

71
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:02,182
UH... OH, BECAUSE I HAVEN'T REALLY PAID THE BILL.

72
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,684
LOOK, IF YOU NEED MONEY, WOULD YOU PLEASE, PLEASE

73
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,187
JUST LET ME LOAN YOU SOME MONEY? NO, CHANDLER.

74
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,188
LOOK, FORGET ABOUT IT, OKAY?

75
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,690
LOOK, I KNOW THINGS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE TIGHT

76
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,692
SINCE JANINE MOVED OUT-- GOD, WAS SHE HOT.

77
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,194
WHOA HO. I KNOW.

78
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,196
BUT LOOK, I CAN HANDLE IT, ALL RIGHT?

79
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,698
I CAN... LISTEN TO THE RADIO, HUH?

80
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,202
AND, UH, HEY, ROSS GAVE ME THIS GREAT BOOK.

81
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,704
OKAY, FINE. YOU WANT TO SEE IF THE JOKE STEALER

82
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,706
WILL LET US WATCH THE SHOW AT HIS PLACE?

83
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,707
SURE. YEAH.

84
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,711
PAID YOUR PHONE BILL? NOT SO MUCH.

85
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,720
HEY.

86
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,722
OH. IT'S ONLY YOU.

87
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,225
WH WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

88
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,726
WE ARE LOOKING AT A PLAYBOY.

89
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,228
OH, I WANT TO LOOK, TOO.

90
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,234
YIKES!

91
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,236
SO DO YOU THINK THAT THESE PICTURES...

92
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,238
ARE THEY TRYING TO TELL A STORY?

93
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,739
OH, WELL, YEAH, SURE.

94
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,242
I MEAN, LIKE IN THE CASE OF THIS YOUNG WOMAN

95
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,743
SHE HAS LOST HER CLOTHES, SO...

96
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,246
SO SHE RIDES NAKED ON  THE HORSE, SHE'S CRYING OUT.

97
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,748
"WHERE ARE THEY? WHERE ARE THEY?"

98
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,750
WELL, SHE'S NOT GOING TO FIND THEM

99
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,252
LYING IN THE GRASS LIKE THAT.

100
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,753

101
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,257
OH... YEAH.

102
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,258
OH, REMEMBER THE DAYS

103
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,260
WHEN YOU USED TO GO OUT TO THE BARN

104
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,761
LIFT UP YOUR SHIRT AND BEND OVER?

105
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,263
YEAH.

106
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,767
YOU SEE, NOW...

107
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,769
.
SEE, NOW, I WO ULD DATE THIS GIRL

108
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,272
SHE'S CUTE; SHE'S OUTDOORSY.

109
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,274
YOU KNOW, AND SHE KNOWS HOW TO BUILD A FIRE.

110
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,776
I MEAN, THAT'S GOT TO COME IN HANDY.

111
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,278
HEY, I GOT A QUESTION. MM HMM?

112
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,782
IF YOU HAD TO PICK ONE OF US TO DATE, WHO WOULD IT BE?

113
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,783
I DON'T KNOW.

114
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,785
ME, NEITHER. RACHEL.

115
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,788
WHAT?

116
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,292
I DON'T KNOW.

117
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,294
ME, NEITHER.

118
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,800
YOU KNOW, YOU FORGET HOW MANY GREAT SONGS HEART HAD.

119
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,802
YEAH. YEAH.

120
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,805
YOU KNOW, "BARRACUDA" WAS THE FIRST SONG

121
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,308
I LEARNED TO PLAY ON THE KEYBOARD.

122
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,311
SO YOU HEARD IT, YOU REPEATED IT...

123
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,314
SO THAT MUST MEAN... YOU WROTE IT.

124
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,817
OH, YOU GUYS WITH THIS JOKE.

125
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,320
LOOK, I GOT TO SAY, I KNOW I CRACKED UP

126
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,322
BUT I'M NOT EVEN SURE I GOT IT.

127
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,823
WHAT?

128
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,825
YOU DIDN'T GET IT?

129
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,827
THE DOCTOR IS A MONKEY.

130
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,829

131
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,332
AND MONKEYS CAN'T WRITE OUT PRESCRIPTIONS.

132
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,833

133
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,837
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO LAUGH AT MY JOKE.

134
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,839
YOUR JOKE?

135
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,842
WELL, I THINK THE HEF WOULD DISAGREE

136
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:48,348
WHICH IS WHY HE SENT ME A CHECK FOR $100 DOLLARS.

137
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,350
SO YOU STOLE MY JOKE, AND YOU STOLE MY MONEY?

138
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,851
YOU KNOW...

139
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,353
I WAS GOING TO STICK IT IN THE ATM

140
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,856
BUT NOW I THINK I'LL SHOW THE SEXY TELLER

141
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,360
THAT I AM A PUBLISHED WRITER.

142
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,362
WELL, SHE IS GOING TO KNOW THAT YOU STOLE THE JOKE.

143
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,864
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, FOLLOW ME DOWN THERE? YEAH.

144
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,867
WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO GO NOW ANYWAY. OKAY.

145
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,372
HERE YOU GO. OH.

146
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,873
UH...

147
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,376
UH, GUNTHER...

148
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,877
I CAN'T PAY FOR THIS RIGHT NOW

149
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,379
BECAUSE, UH, I'M NOT WORKING

150
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,382
SO I'VE HAD TO CUT DOWN  ON SOME LUXURIES LIKE, UH...

151
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,384
PAYING FOR STUFF, SO...

152
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,888
WELL... IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN WORK HERE.

153
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,889
UH, I DON'T KNOW.

154
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,392
IT'S, UH, IT'S JUST...

155
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,395
SEE, I WAS A REGULAR ON A SOAP OPERA, YOU KNOW...

156
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,398
AND TO GO FROM THAT TO THIS, IT'S JUST...

157
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,402
AND PLUS, YOU KNOW, I'D HAVE TO WAIT ON ALL MY FRIENDS.

158
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,903
OKAY, BUT THE MONEY'S GOOD.

159
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,407
PLUS YOU GET TO STARE AT RACHEL AS MUCH AS YOU WANT.

160
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,410
WHAT?

161
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,911
FLEXIBLE HOURS.

162
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,413
OH.

163
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,416
MAYBE... MAYBE I COULD BE A WAITER.

164
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,418
COULD I USE THE PHONE?

165
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:05,925
SHE PICKED RACHEL.

166
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,927
I MEAN, SHE TRIED TO BACK OUT OF IT

167
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,930
BUT IT WAS OBVIOUS-- SHE PICKED RACHEL.

168
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,934
HE TOOK MY JOKE; HE J JUST TOOK IT.

169
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,436
THAT'S WRONG.

170
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,937
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS WRONG?

171
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,439
PHOEBE PICKING RACHEL.

172
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,441
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE PICKED RACHEL?

173
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,942
ROSS. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE ROSS DID?

174
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,945
HE STOLE MY JOKE.

175
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,948
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOING TO GET A JOKE JOURNAL, YOU KNOW?

176
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,450
AND DOCUMENT THE DATE AND TIME

177
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,452
OF EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY JOKES.

178
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,953
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. YEAH.

179
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,456
YOU KNOW WHAT'S A BAD IDEA? PICKING RACHEL.

180
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,957
THAT'S RIGHT.

181
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,461
DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING?

182
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,463
WELL, MAYBE IT'S THE SOUND OF ROSS

183
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,466
CLIMBING INTO MY BRAIN AND STEALING MY THOUGHTHS.

184
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,469
I THINK IT'S COMING FROM THE LIVING ROOM.

185
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,976
I FINISHED MY BOOK.

186
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,483

187
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,485
HEY, YOU GUYS.

188
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,487
HEY. HEY.

189
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,988
OH, DON'T YOU GUYS LOOK CUTE.

190
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,991
YOU GUYS MAKE SUCH A CUTE COUPLE.

191
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,994
MONICA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

192
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,497
NOTHING. I'M JUST TRYING TO RECREATE SOME OF THE FUN

193
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,499
THAT WE HAD AT MY PLACE THE OTHER DAY.

194
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,501
REMEMBER? WHEN YOU PICKED RACHEL OVER ME?

195
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,504
THAT WAS FUNNY.

196
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,005
YES, IT WAS KIND OF FUNNY.

197
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,507
IT WASN'T FUNNY AT ALL.

198
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,009
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

199
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,011
WHY DIDN'T YOU PICK ME?

200
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,514
FINE.

201
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,015
THE REASON THAT I WAS LEANING

202
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,518
A LITTLE BIT MORE TOWARD RACHEL THAN YOU

203
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,021
IS JUST, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE... KIND OF HIGH MAINTENANCE.

204
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,523
OKAY, LET'S GO TO LUNCH.

205
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,525
THAT... THAT IS COMPLETELY UNTRUE.

206
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,026
YOU THINK I'M HIGH MAINTENANCE?

207
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,529
OKAY, PROVE IT-- I WANT YOU TO WRITE OUT A LIST

208
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,532
AND WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH IT POINT BY POINT.

209
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,536
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT -- YOU'RE EASYGOING.

210
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,538
YOU'RE JUST NOT

211
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,039
AS EASYGOING AS RACHEL.

212
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,542
YOU KNOW, SHE'S JUST MORE... FLEXIBLE

213
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,544
AND AND MELLOW, THAT'S ALL.

214
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,550
WELL, PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT.

215
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,051
YEAH, YOU KNOW, RACHEL--

216
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,053
SHE'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, YOU KNOW?

217
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,555
YOU CAN JUST WALK ALL OVER HER.

218
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,056
WHAT? WAIT A MINUTE.

219
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,058
WHAT, ARE YOU SAYING I'M A PUSHOVER?

220
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,560
I'M NOT A PUSHOVER.

221
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,062
OH, OKAY. YOU'RE NOT A PUSHOVER.

222
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,566
OH, MY... YOU THINK I'M A PUSHOVER.

223
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,067
WELL, WATCH THIS. YOU KNOW WHAT?

224
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,569
YOU'RE NOT INVITED TO LUNCH.

225
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,070
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?

226
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,072
I THINK THAT'S PRETTY STRONG, IS WHAT I THINK.

227
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,575
COME ON, MONICA, LET'S GO TO LUNCH.

228
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,078
YOU START WORKING ON THAT LIST!

229
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,583
I CANNOT BELIEVE HER. I KNOW.

230
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,585
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO EAT?

231
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,087
OH... OH! I LOVE THAT JAPANESE PLACE.

232
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,089
I'M SICK OF JAPANESE. WE'RE NOT GOING THERE.

233
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,091
ALL RIGHT, WELL, WHERE VER YOU WANT TO GO IS COOL.

234
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,593
ALL RIGHT.

235
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,098
OH, HEY, GUNTHER

236
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,101
CHECK THIS OUT.

237
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,603

238
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,606
YEAH, THAT CHANDLER CRACKS ME UP.

239
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,111
HEY, ROSS, LISTEN, YOU WANT ANYTHING TO DRINK?

240
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,112
BECAUSE I'M HEADING UP THERE.

241
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,114
UH, YEAH, I'LL TAKE A COFFEE.

242
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,115
THANKS, MAN. SURE.

243
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,117
COFFEE? NO.

244
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,619
COFFEE? BECAUSE I'M GOING UP THERE.

245
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,120
OH, NO, THANK YOU. OKAY.

246
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,122
YOU GUYS NEED ANYTHING?

247
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,124
BECAUSE I'M HEADING UP THERE.

248
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,626
I'D LOVE A... ICE WATER.

249
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,628
YOU GOT IT.

250
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,130
JOEY... WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

251
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,632
JUST BEING FRIENDLY.

252
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,637
JOEY, I I DON'T THINK YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GO BACK THERE.

253
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,138
NO, NO, IT'S OKAY. RIGHT GUNTHER?

254
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,641
DON'T WINK AT ME.

255
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,144
AND PUT ON YOUR APRON.

256
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,648
OKAY.

257
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,150
I DON'T SEE YOU ASKING ANY OTHER PAYING CUSTOMERS

258
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,152
TO PUT ON APRONS.

259
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,155
JOEY... DO YOU WORK HERE?

260
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,156
NO.

261
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,658
WAITER? YEAH?

262
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,161
JOEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

263
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,164
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US YOU WORK HERE?

264
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,165
WELL...

265
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,669
WELL... IT'S KIND OF EMBARRASSING, YOU KNOW?

266
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,672
I MEAN, I WAS AN ACTOR; NOW I'M A WAITER.

267
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,675
IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.

268
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,677
SO IS YOUR APRON-- YOU'RE WEARING IT LIKE A CAPE.

269
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,181
I MEAN, THE JOB'S EASY, AND THE MONEY'S GOOD, YOU KNOW

270
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,184
AND I GUESS IF I'M GOING TO BE HANGING OUT HERE ANYWAY

271
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,186
I MIGHT AS WELL GET PAID FOR IT, RIGHT?

272
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,690
I JUST FEEL KIND OF WEIRD SERVING YOU GUYS, YOU KNOW?

273
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,691
IT'LL BE GREAT. OH...

274
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,192
JOEY, COME ON, I DID IT

275
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,694
AND IT WAS FINE.

276
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,195
YEAH. WHY WOULD IT BE WEIRD?

277
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,699
HEY, JOEY, UH, COULD I GET SOME COFFEE?

278
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,702
OKAY, I GUESS IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT WEIRD.

279
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,705
SERIOUSLY, I ASKED YOU BEFORE-- YOU STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT.

280
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,709
SEE, NOW IT'S WEIRD AGAIN.

281
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,711
I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT YOU WORK HERE.

282
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,713
YOU'LL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY, AND HERE'S YOUR FIRST TIP:

283
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,716
DON'T EAT YELLOW SNOW.

284
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,218

285
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,722
2:15. COFFEE HOUSE.

286
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,725
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS GREAT.

287
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,727
FINALLY, I HAVE SOMEONE I CAN PASS ON MY WISDOM TO.

288
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,729
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS I LEARNED

289
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,730
WHILE WORKING AT THE COFFEE HOUSE.

290
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,233
UM, FIRST OF ALL, THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT;

291
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,737
A SMILE GOES A LONG WAY;

292
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,240
AND IF ANYONE IS EVER RUDE TO YOU...

293
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,242
SNEEZE MUFFIN.

294
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,245
THANKS, RACHE.

295
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,747
HEY, LOOK...

296
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,249
YOU GUYS ARE JUST TERRIFIC, YOU KNOW?

297
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,751
NOW, HOW ABOUT CLEARING OUT OF HERE

298
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,253
SO I CAN GET SOME NEW CUSTOMERS, HUH?

299
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,755
IT'S ALL ABOUT TURNOVER.

300
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,757

301
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,758
JOEY...

302
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,259
SERIOUSLY

303
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,761
CAN I GET MY COFFEE?

304
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,763
OH, I'M SORRY, ROSS.

305
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,264
I'LL GET IT FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

306
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,267
AND SINCE I MADE YOU WAIT, I'LL TOSS IN A FREE MUFFIN.

307
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,276
PHOEBE, WE WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND.

308
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,277
OKAY.

309
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,279
SO...

310
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,281
MAYBE I AM A LITTLE HIGH MAINTENANCE

311
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,784
AND MAYBE RACHEL IS A LITTLE BIT OF A PUSHOVER

312
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,286
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE DECIDED THAT YOU ARE?

313
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,789
YES, WE ARE VERY SORRY TO TELL YOU THIS

314
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,290
BUT YOU, PHOEBE, ARE FLAKY.

315
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,792
HA!

316
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,294
THAT'S TRUE.

317
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,796
I AM FLAKY.

318
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,798
SO, WHAT?

319
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,801
YOU'RE JUST, UH, YOU'RE JUST OKAY WITH BEING FLAKY?

320
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,803
YEAH, TOTALLY.

321
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,806
WELL, THEN I'M OKAY WITH BEING HIGH MAINTENANCE.

322
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,809
YEAH, AND I AM OKAY WITH BEING A PUSHOVER.

323
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,310
THAT'S GREAT.

324
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,812
GOOD FOR YOU GUYS!

325
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,313
I AM NOT HIGH MAINTENANCE!

326
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,315
I AM NOT A PUSHOVER!

327
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,818
WHO SAID YOU WERE?!

328
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,819
YOU DID! YOU DID!

329
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,820
I'M FLAKY.

330
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,321
I'LL SAY ANYTHING.

331
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,329
HEY, GUNTHER, CAN YOU COVER FOR ME?

332
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,331
I JUST GOT AN AUDITION.

333
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,334
NO. I'M LEAVING TO GET MY HAIR DYED.

334
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,838
REALLY? I LIKE YOUR NATURAL COLOR.

335
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,340
COME ON, MAN, IT'S A GREAT PART.

336
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,341
CHECK IT OUT.

337
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,843
I'M THE LEAD GUY'S BEST FRIEND

338
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,345
AND I WAIT FOR HIM IN THIS BAR AND SAVE HIS SEAT.

339
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,346
LISTEN. LISTEN.

340
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,349
I'M SORRY. THAT SEAT'S SAVED.

341
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,853
THAT'S THE WHOLE PART?

342
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,856
OKAY, MAYBE HE'S NOT HIS BEST FRIEND, BUT...

343
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,357
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU IN AN HOUR.

344
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,362
I COULD TOTALLY GET THAT PART.

345
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,364
I'M SORRY. THIS SEAT IS TAKEN.

346
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,365
OH, EXCUSE ME.

347
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,367
NO, NO, NO, I... I DIDN'T MEAN YOU

348
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,369
BUT, UH, YOU BELIEVED ME, HUH?

349
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:34,373
I BELIEVED YOU WERE SAVING THIS SEAT FOR SOMEONE.

350
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,876
SO YOU'D HIRE ME, RIGHT?

351
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,879
FOR WHAT?

352
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,880
EXACTLY!

353
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,882
ALL RIGHT, UH, EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP.

354
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,885
THE COFFEEHOUSE IS GOING TO BE CLOSED FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.

355
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:46,886
 WHAT?!

356
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,387
WE JUST GOT HERE.

357
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,389
YEAH, IT'S, UH, IT'S FOR THE KIDS.

358
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,391
YEAH, TO, UH, KEEP THE KIDS OFF DRUGS.

359
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,893
YUP, IT'S

360
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,395
A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE IN THIS MONTH'S PLAYBOY.

361
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,398
I'M SURE YOU ALL READ ABOUT IT.

362
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,402
HEY, HEY, DON'T YOU WANT

363
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,404
TO KEEP GUNS AWAY FROM KIDS?

364
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,405
YOU SAID DRUGS.

365
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,407
IT'S A VICIOUS CYCLE. GET OUT!

366
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,912
GO!

367
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,424
IT'S MY JOKE.

368
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,926
IT'S MY JOKE.

369
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,430
IT'S MY JO IT'S MY JOKE.

370
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,434
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK WE'RE GO ING TO SETTLE THIS.

371
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,937
NO. LET'S HAVE MONICA DECIDE.

372
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,938
YEAH.

373
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:39,939
YEAH. HEY, MON!

374
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,940
MON, GET OUT HERE!

375
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:41,941
MONICA!

376
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,442
OKAY, OKAY.

377
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,945
YOU HAVE TO HELP US DECIDE WHOSE JOKE THIS IS.

378
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,946
WHY DO I HAVE TO DECIDE?

379
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,448
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN BE FAIR.

380
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,449
I CAN'T BE FAIR.

381
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,450
YOU'RE MY BOYFRIEND.

382
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,452
YEAH, BUT I'M YOUR BROTHER.

383
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,954
WE'RE FAMILY.

384
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,957
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD.

385
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,460
DON'T TRY TO SWAY HER.

386
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,964
I'M YOUR ONLY CHANCE TO HAVE A BABY.

387
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,468
OKAY, LET'S GO.

388
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,470
ALL RIGHT, UM, OKAY, WE'LL EACH TELL YOU

389
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,973
HOW WE CAME  UP WITH THE JOKE

390
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,474
AND THEN YOU DECIDE

391
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,477
WHICH ONE OF US IS TELLING THE TRUTH-- ME.

392
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,479
CHANDLER, YOU GO FIRST.

393
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,981
OKAY, I THOUGHT OF THE JOKE

394
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,983
TWO MONTHS AGO AT LUNCH WITH STEVE.

395
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,484
OH, WAIT, IS HE THE GUY I MET AT CHRISTMAS?

396
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,485
CAN I FINISH MY STORY?

397
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,487
DO YOU WANT ME TO PICK YOU?

398
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,992
SEE, I WOULD NEVER SNAP AT YOU LIKE THAT.

399
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,501
CONTINUE.

400
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,004
OKAY, SO STEVE SAID HE HAD TO GO TO THE DOCTOR

401
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,506
AND STEVE'S DOCTOR'S NAME IS DR. MOMPEY.

402
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,008
SO I SAID, "DR. MONKEY?"

403
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,511
AND THAT IS HOW THE WHOLE DR. MONKEY THING CAME UP.

404
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,517
ARE YOU KIDDING?

405
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,520
OKAY, LOOK, I STUDY EVOLUTION.

406
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,022
REMEMBER? EVOLUTION?

407
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,023
MONKEY INTO MAN.

408
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,525
PLUS, I'M A DOCTOR

409
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,528
AND IHADA MONKEY.

410
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,533
I'M DR. MONKEY!

411
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,538
I'M NOT ARGUING WITH THAT.

412
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,539
ALL RIGHT, I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

413
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,041
I HAVE MADE MY DECISION.

414
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,542

415
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,045
YOU ARE BOTH IDIOTS.

416
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,549
THE JOKE IS NOT FUNNY, AND IT'S OFFENSIVE TO WOMEN...

417
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,551
AND DOCTORS... AND MONKEYS.

418
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,056
YOU SHOULDN'T BE ARGUING OVER WHO GETS CREDIT.

419
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,558
YOU SHOULD BE ARGUING OVER WHO GETS BLAMED

420
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,561
FOR INFLICTING THIS HORRIBLE JOKE UPON THE WORLD.

421
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,562
NOW, LET IT GO.

422
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,564
THE JOKE SUCKS!

423
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,570
IT'S YOUR JOKE.

424
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,072
IT IS NOT.

425
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,089
MY GOD, CHANDLER, THERE YOU ARE.

426
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,590
HI I!

427
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,593
HEY, IT'S PHOEBE AND RACHEL.

428
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,594
WHY DON'T YOU TELL THEM

429
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,096
WHAT YOU WERE TELLING ME EARLIER

430
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,099
ABOUT ME NOT BEING HIGH MAINTENANCE.

431
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:27,106
MONICA IS A SELF SUFFICIENT, TOGETHER LADY.

432
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:31,610
BEING WITH HER HAS BEEN LIKE BEING ON A VACATION.

433
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,115
AND WHAT MAY BE PERCEIVED AS HIGH MAINTENANCE

434
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,619
IS MERELY ATTENTION TO DETAIL AND...

435
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,121

436
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,123
GENEROSITY OF SPIRIT.

437
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,126
WOW.

438
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,127
YOU KNOW WHAT?

439
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,130
THAT IS THE BEST FAKE SPEECH I THINK I'VE EVER HEARD.

440
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,133
REALLY? NO, I'VE HEARD BETTER.

441
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,135
WAIT. WAIT. HE CAME UP WITH THAT HIMSELF.

442
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,136
TELL THEM, CHANDLER.

443
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,637
I'M OUT OF WORDS.

444
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,639
SHOULD I JUST SAY THE WHOLE THING AGAIN?

445
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,641
I AM NOT HIGH MAINTENANCE.

446
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,642
I AM NOT.

447
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,643
CHANDLER!

448
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,647
YOU'RE A LITTLE HIGH MAINTENANCE.

449
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,149

450
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,151
YOU ARE ON MY LIST.

451
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,655
LOOK, I'M SORRY, BUT YOU'RE NOT EASYGOING

452
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,657
BUT YOU'RE PASSIONATE

453
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,658
AND THAT'S GOOD.

454
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,661
AND WHEN YOU GET UPSET ABOUT THE LITTLE THINGS

455
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,163
I THINK THAT I'M PRETTY GOOD

456
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,165
AT MAKING YOU FEEL BETTER ABOUT THAT.

457
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,666
AND THAT'S GOOD, TOO.

458
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,668
SO THEY CAN SAY THAT YOU'RE HIGH MAINTENANCE

459
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,171
BUT IT'S OKAY BECAUSE I LIKE...

460
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:36,175
MAINTAINING YOU.

461
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,684
I DIDN'T EVEN TELL HIM TO SAY THAT.

462
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,188
OKAY.

463
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,689
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE OFF MY LIST.

464
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,191
I'M OFF THE LIST.

465
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,692
PHOEBE...

466
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:57,196
IT'S OKAY THAT YOU DON'T WANT ME TO BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND

467
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,199
BECAUSE I HAVE THE BEST BOYFRIEND.

468
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,704
YOU KNOW, SUDDENLY I FIND YOU VERY ATTRACTIVE.

469
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,209
HEY, BUDDY BOY, HOW DID THE AUDITION GO?

470
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,710
OH, NOT GOOD.

471
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,713
I DIDN'T GET THE PART AND, UH, LOST MY JOB HERE

472
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,714
SO...

473
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,217
WOW, THAT IS A BAD AUDITION.

474
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,721
HOW DID YOU LOSE YOUR JOB HERE?

475
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,223
WELL, I HAD THE AUDITION

476
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,226
BUT GUNTHER SAID I HAD TO STAY HERE AND BE IN CHARGE

477
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,727
SO HE COULD GO GET HIS HAIR DYED.

478
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,230
SO, I WENT ANYWAY AND THEN HE FIRED ME.

479
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,232
HE LEFT WORK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY

480
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,234
TO DO A PERSONAL ERRAND AND LEFT YOU IN CHARGE

481
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,736
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN WORKING HERE FOR TWO DAYS.

482
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,737
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

483
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,239
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

484
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,740
WELL, JOEY

485
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,742
YOU CAN'T LET HIM GET AWAY WITH THAT.

486
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,245
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT GOING TO LET HIM GET AWAY WITH THAT.

487
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,746
I'M GOING TO SAY SOMETHING TO...

488
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,748
NO, I REALLY SHOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO HIM.

489
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,749
NO, I SHOULD SAY

490
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,251
SOMETHING TO HIM!

491
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:57,256
GUNTHER, I WANT YOU TO GIVE JOEY HIS JOB BACK.

492
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,758
THAT IS REALLY NOT FAIR THAT YOU HAVE TO FIRE...

493
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,760
OKAY.

494
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,264
WHAT?

495
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,266
HE CAN HAVE HIS JOB BACK.

496
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,770
THAT'S RIGHT, HE CAN HAVE HIS... JOB BACK.

497
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,774
GLAD WE GOT THAT ALL STRAIGHTENED OUT.

498
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,277
THERE YOU GO, JOEY.

499
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,778
YOU GOT YOUR JOB BACK.

500
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,779
THAT'S GREAT.

501
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,281
THANKS, RACHE.

502
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,782
YEAH, PRETTY NICE, HUH?

503
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,784
NOW WHO'S A PUSHOVER?

504
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,286
RACHE, YOU'RE IN MY SEAT.

505
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,787
I'M SORRY.

506
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,295
HEY, I NEVER GOT TO HEAR WHO YOU GUYS WOULD PICK TO BE

507
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,296
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

508
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,297
OH, I'D PICK YOU, PHOEBE.

509
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,798
OH, YEAH. DEFINITELY YOU, PHEEBS.

510
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,800
YEAH, WELL, I KIND OF THOUGHT.

511
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,308
HEY.

512
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,309
OH, HEY.

513
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,310
WAIT. I HAVE A QUESTION.

514
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,311
IF ONE OF  YOU HAD TO PICK

515
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,313
ONE OF THE OTHER TWO GUYS TO GO OUT WITH

516
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,314
WHO WOULD YOU PICK?

517
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,815
NO WAY.

518
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,816
I'M NOT ANSWERING THAT JOEY.

519
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,321
NO WAY.

520
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,323
I'M NOT ANSWERING THAT.
