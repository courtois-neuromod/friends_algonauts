00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,809
OH... YOU'RE NO ORDINARY ROOMMATE, ARE YOU?

30
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,811
THIS IS GOING TO BE INTERESTING.

31
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:45,812

00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,116
SO, I JUST FINISHED THIS FASCINATING BOOK.

60
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,119
BY THE YEAR 2030, THERE'LL BE COMPUTERS

61
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,123
THAT CAN CARRY OUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF FUNCTIONS

62
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,125
AS AN ACTUAL HUMAN BRAIN.

63
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,627
SO, THEORETICALLY, YOU COULD DOWNLOAD

64
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:12,132
YOUR THOUGHTS AND MEMORIES INTO THIS COMPUTER

65
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:16,636
AND AND AND LIVE FOREVER, AS A MACHINE.

66
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:24,144
AND I JUST REALIZED I CAN SLEEP WITH MY EYES OPEN.

67
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,145

68
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:25,645

71
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,652
TO THE FLOOR.

72
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,155
I DIDN'T NAIL THE BOXES TO THE FLOOR.

73
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,656
OH, SO YOU CAN MOVE THEM?

74
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:37,657

00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,659

92
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,692

00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,194

00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,196
SO, UH, WHAT, UH, WHAT DO YOU DO?

95
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,197

00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,199
YOU'RE A DANCER?

97
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,202

YEAH?

105
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,717
DID YOU EVEN INTERVIEW THIS WOMAN

106
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,719
BEFORE YOU ASKED HER TO MOVE IN?

107
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,221
OF COURSE I DID.

108
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,223
UH HUH. WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU ASK HER?

109
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,225
"WHEN CAN YOU MOVE IN?"

110
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:51,231
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING HER INTO OUR LIVES.

111
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,233
UNBELIEVABLE.

112
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,234

113
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,236
NO, NO, NO, NO. SHE'S NOT MY TYPE.

114
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,238
NOT FOR ME. SHE'S  NOT MY TYPE. SHE'S TOO...

115
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,240
BEAUTIFUL, TALL, SEXY, SHOWING HER STOMACH?

116
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,743
HEY, LOOK AT ALL THE BOXES.

117
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,247
OH, I CANNOT WAIT TO ASK HER OUT.

118
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,248
WAIT A MINUTE, JOEY.

119
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,749
JOEY, YOU CAN'T ASK HER OUT.

120
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,251
SHE'S YOUR ROOMMATE.

121
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,253
YOU KNOW, IT'S... IT'LL BE WAY TOO COMPLICATED.

122
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,754
YEAH, YEAH, MAN, DON'T DO IT.

123
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,755
I MEAN, IF YOU DATE HER

124
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,758
THEN THEN THEN I CAN'T DATE HER.

125
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,261
LOOK, YOU KNOW, WHAT IF YOU STARTED GOING OUT WITH HER

126
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,262
AND IT DIDN'T WORK OUT?

127
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,764
THAT'S WHEN I MAKE MY MOVE.

128
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,266
NOW, REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE GOING OUT

129
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,268
WITH THAT GIRL DONNA AND YOU GUYS BROKE UP?

130
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,769
REMEMBER HOW HORRIBLE IT WAS

131
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,771
WHEN YOU GUYS BUMPED INTO EACH OTHER AT THE SUPERMARKET?

132
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,273
OH, GOD, YEAH.

133
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,775
NOW, IMAGINE YOU LIVE... AT THE SUPERMARKET.

134
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,777
OKAY.

135
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,779
NO, NO.

136
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,780
OH. OH.

00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,781
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

138
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,782
I DON'T WANT THAT.

139
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,284
I CAN'T DATE HER.

140
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,785
YEAH, AND YOU BETTER WATCH THE FLIRTING, TOO

141
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,287
BECAUSE IN SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS...

142
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,288
IT COULD BE TROUBLE.

143
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,789
WELL, THAT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH, MON.

144
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,792
I MEAN, IT'S HARD FOR ME TO BE AROUND AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN

145
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,793
AND NOT FLIRT.

146
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,295

147
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,297
WELL, YOU'RE AROUND MEALL THE TIME

148
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,298
AND YOU DON'T FLIRT.

149
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,301
YOU A LITTLE SAD ABOUT THAT, SWEETHEART?

150
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,807
I HAVE TO TIE MY SHOE.

151
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,309
SO YOU GO AHEAD. I'LL CATCH UP.

152
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,310
 OKAY.

153
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,814

154
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,815
COME ON!

155
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,816
THAT'S NOT RUNNING!

156
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,318
LET'S GO!

157
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,325
YOU GUYS,  I'M TELLING YOU

158
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,826
WHEN SHE RUNS, SHE LOOKS LIKE

159
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,830
A CROSS BETWEEN KERMIT THE FROG AND THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN.

160
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,334
MONICA HAD SUCH A CRUSH ON HIM.

161
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,335

162
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,837
YEAH, SHE USED TO KISS HIS POSTER

163
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,340
EVERY NIGHT BEFORE SHE WENT TO BED.

164
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,841
OH, I USED TO DO THAT, TOO.

165
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,343
DID YOU ALSO HAVE HIS ALBUM

166
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,345
IT'S NOT EASY BEING GREEN?

167
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,349
AW, MON...

168
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,850

AND I KNOW SHE'S GOING TO WANT TO RUN AGAIN.

172
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,358
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET OUT OF IT.

173
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,359
I MEAN, I LIVE WITH HER.

174
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,861
WHY DON'T YOU JUST  BE STRAIGHT WITH HER?

175
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,862
TELL HER THE TRUTH.

176
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,364
YOU'RE RIGHT.

177
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,366
YOU'RE RIGHT, I SHOULD JUST TELL HER THE TRUTH.

178
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,367
HEY. HEY.

179
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,369

WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

186
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,385
I DON'T KNOW.

187
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,389
RACHEL, I'M I'M SORRY THAT I HURT YOUR ANKLES.

00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,414
OH, AND LOOK, THERE'S STILL ONE BOX

196
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,416
THAT I HAVE TO UNPACK.

197
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,917

198
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,920
I GOTCHA!

199
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,422

200
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,423
OH, MY GOD!

201
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,925
YOU ALMOST GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK.

202
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,927
BOY, IT WAS SO HARD NOT TO LAUGH

203
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,929
I'LL TELL YOU.

204
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,431
OH, HEY HEY...

205
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,432
THE PLACE LOOKS GREAT.

206
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,933
YEAH, NOT BAD, RIGHT?

207
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,435
YOU KNOW WHAT? MONICA'S GOING TO BE WORKING LATE.

208
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,437
SO, I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS PLACE SPOTLESS.

209
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,938
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I'M GOING TO DO?

210
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,939
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I'M GOING TO DO?

211
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,940
I'M GOING TO GO DOWNSTAIRS.

212
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,941
I'M GOING TO GET HER SOME FLOWERS.

213
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,944
NOW, WHO WOULD NOT WANT TO LIVE WITH ME?

214
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,446
I DON'T.

215
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,947
NO, I WANT TO LIVE

216
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,950
WITH THE SUPER HOT AUSTRALIAN DANCER.

217
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,951
OKAY, NOW, HOW'S THAT GOING NOW?

218
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,953
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THE NOT FLIRTING THING?

219
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,455
UH, YEAH, BUT... SO FAR, YEAH

220
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,456
BUT IT'S TOUGH , YOU KNOW?

221

I GOT ALL THIS THIS BUILT UP FLIRTING ENERGY

222
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,960
AND AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET RID OF IT.

223
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,965
HOW YOU DOING?

224
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,967

225
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,475
OH, MAN.

00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,490

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,991
WHY DON'T YOU TRY TO...

231
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,493

232
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:14,494
WHAT'S WRONG?

233
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,995
UH, UH, NOTHING.

234
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,997
I JUST, UH... I I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO TOUCH ME

235
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,499
BECAUSE I'M I'M ALL SWEATY

236
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,500
FROM THE WORKOUT.

237
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,502
I'M GOING TO HIT THE SHOWER.

238
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,006
OH, MY GOD!

239
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,509
OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT STUFF HANGING IN THERE.

240
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,512

241
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,013

00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,015

243
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,018

244
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,020

245
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,024
 HI!

246
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,025
OH, YEAH, UH HUH, IT'S ME.

247
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,026
I SAW YOU GRAB

248
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,028
YOUR RUNNING SHOES THIS MORNING

249
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,029
AND SNEAK OUT.

250
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,030
YOU LIED SO YOU COULD RUN

251
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,032
BY YOURSELF.

252
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,534
NO, PHOEBE, NO, I WAS... NO.

253
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,035

00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,037
I WAS... I WAS ACTUALLY JUST CHECKING...

255
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,540
TO SEE... IF I COULD RUN AND I CAN.

256
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,542
PLEASE, RACHEL, I AM NOT AN IDIOT.

257
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,043
NO, WAIT, PHOEBE.

258
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,056
WOW...

259
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,559
COUPLES WHO LIVE TOGETHER DO START TO LOOK ALIKE.

260
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,561
LOOK, I AM WORKING RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

261
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,064
SO JUST SAY WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY AND LEAVE ME ALONE.

262
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,568
HUH. SOUND ALIKE, TOO.

263
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,570
SO... MONDLER...

264
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,071

267
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,577
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

268
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,578
I AM CLEANING.

269
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,580
DID YOU GET MONICA'S AUTHORIZATION

270
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,081
TO MOVE ALL OF HER STUFF.

271
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,583
"AUTHORIZATION"-- I DON'T NEED THAT.

272
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,084
I'M GOING TO PUT EVERYTHING BACK.

273
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,587
PUT IT BACK EXACTLY WHERE YOU FOUND IT?

274
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,590
YES, I'M GOING TO PUT IT BACK "EXACTLY" WHERE I FOUND IT.

275
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,092
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, THAT ATTITUDE IS NOT HELPING.

276
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,594
OKAY, SHE IS NOT GOING TO CARE

277
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,096
IF I PUT HER STUFF BACK IN THE SAME STUPID PLACE.

278
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,097
OH, HELLO?

279
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,100
DID YOU JUST MEET MONICA?

280
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,604
SHE'S GOING TO RECOGNIZE THAT I DID A NICE THING

281
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,606
AND AND APPRECIATE IT.

282
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,607
HUH.

283
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,608
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY

284
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,609
THIS WILL WORK OUT WELL

285
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,111
BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE TO MOVE BACK IN WITH JOEY

286
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,114
JOEY'S HOT NEW ROOMMATE CAN COME LIVE WITH ME.

287
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,115
I SEE. I SEE.

288
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,117
Y Y YOU'RE TRYING TO FREAK ME OUT.

289
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,620
LOOK, CHANDLER, MONICA IS REALLY WEIRD

290
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,122
ABOUT THIS KIND  OF STUFF, ALL RIGHT?

291
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,125
BELIEVE ME, I LIVED WITH HER FOR 16 YEARS.

292
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,127
SHE IS GOING TO FREAK OUT.

293
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,129
OH, MY GOD, SHE'S GOING TO SIT ON YOU.

294
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,133
THAT PROBABLY WON'T HURT AS MUCH ANYMORE, BUT...

295
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,134
NO, SHE'S NOT, OKAY?

296
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,636
YOU KNOW, I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU.

297
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,638
I'M GOING TO CALL HER RIGHT NOW.

298
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,640
PHONE'S DONE.

299
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,642

300
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,144
Hi. HEY, MON, HOW'S IT GOING?

301
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,646
Terrible.

302
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,649
I TELL YOU, IF IF IF I WANT SOMETHING DONE RIGHT

303
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,150
I HAVE TO DO IT MYSELF.

304
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,151
Other people just wreck stuff.

305
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,154
I REALLY THINK I MIGHT KILL SOMEONE TONIGHT.

306
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,659
OH, COME ON, COME ON, IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD.

307
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,661
IT'S WORSE. THE ONLY THING THAT'S GETTING ME THROUGH

308
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,663
IS KNOWING THAT I'M GOING TO BE SEEING YOU SOON.

309
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,665
I think I may even try to get out of here early.

310
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,166
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

311
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,168
NO, IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY REALLY NEED YOU DOWN THERE.

312
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,670
YOU'RE JUST HANGING OUT WITH ROSS?

313
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,672
IT'S ALL GOOD. OKAY, BYE BYE, MON.

314
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,175
SH SHE'S GOING TO KILL ME.

315
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,679
YOU KNOW, THE PHONE WAS FACING THE OTHER WAY...

316
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,681
AND THAT GOES BACK UP THERE.

317
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,684
OKAY, THIS IS GOOD.

318
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,685
THIS IS UNDER CONTROL.

319
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,687
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO?

320
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,689
WE SHOULD START WITH THE BIG STUFF, YOU KNOW?

321
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,190
THAT'LL BE THE EASIEST.

322
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,692
SO, UH, LET'S START WITH THE COUCH.

323
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,193
I GOT IT.

324
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,698
YEAH, THAT THAT

325
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,199
DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT.

326
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,701
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

327
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,703
THE COUCH IS PERFECTLY IN LINE WITH THE CARPET

328
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,204
AND THEN I COULD JUST WALK OVER HERE

329
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,206
AND CAUSALLY JUST PUT MY FEET RIGHT UP ON...

330
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,209
OKAY, HERE'S WHAT WE DO--

331
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,712
WE JUST, UH, MOVE THE COUCH CLOSER TO THE COFFEE TABLE.

332
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,714
WHOA, YEAH, BUT THEN THE BACK OF THE COUCH

333
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,716
WON'T LINE UP WITH THE BACK OF THE CARPET.

334
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,717
OKAY, WELL, HERE--

335
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,218
WE'LL JUST, UH...

336
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,721
WE'LL MOVE THE COFFEE TABLE CLOSER TO THE COUCH.

337
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,722
NO, WHOA! WHOA!

338
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,723
BUT THEN THE COFFEE TABLE

339
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,725
WON'T BE CENTERED IN THE SEATING AREA.

340
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,728
YES, BUT THE COFFEE TABLE DOESN'T HAVE TO...

341
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,729

342
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,231
ROSS!

343
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,734
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

344
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,738
I'M NOT FLIRTING, BUT STILL, I'M I'M DRAWING HER TO ME

345
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,740
LIKE LIKE LIKE A MOTH TO A FLAME!

346
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,248
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON OVER HERE?!

347
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,751
MONICA'S GOING TO KILL YOU.

348
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,754
LOOK, I NEED YOUR HELP, OKAY?

349
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,757
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO TO REPEL THIS WOMAN.

350
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,258
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

351
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,261
YOU GUYS REPEL WOMEN ALL THE TIME!

352
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,765
HEY, I'VE BEEN MARRIED THREE TIMES.

353
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,772
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

354
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,773
I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN.

355
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,775
YOU GET A RAPPORT GOING WITH A WOMAN

356
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,777
BUT SOMEHOW YOU MANAGE TO KILL IT.

357
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,781
TIME AFTER TIME AFTER TIME AFTER TIME.

358
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,282
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?

359
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:07,286
LOOK, WE DO NOT REPEL WOMEN, OKAY?

360
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,789
THAT IS COMPLETELY UNTRUE.

361
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,290
UH, YES, WE DO, MY MAN.

362
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,292
REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE BACK IN COLLEGE

363
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,294
AND WE WENT TO THAT SPRING DANCE

364
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,797
AND YOU WALKED RIGHT UP TO THAT GIRL YOU LIKED

365
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,799
AND YOU COULD NOT STOP TALKING ABOUT

366
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,800
THE IRISH POTATO FAMINE?

367
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,301
WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

368
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,304
YOU WEREN'T SO, YOU KNOW, HOT IN COLLEGE, EITHER.

369
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,307
AFTER EVERYTHING HE SAID, HE'D GO "BA DUM BUMP. CHSSH."

370
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,310
YEAH, MONICA DOESN'T LIKE THAT, EITHER.

371
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,312
MAYBE I SHOULD STOP DOING THAT.

372
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,815
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? GIRLS DON'T LIKE IT

373
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,317
WHEN I START TALKING ABOUT SCIENCE.

374
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,820
THAT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO GIRLS.

375
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,321
THIS IS GREAT, THIS IS GREAT!

376
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,823
WHAT WHAT ELSE, WHAT ELSE?

377
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,325
UH... OH, THEY DON'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU CORRECT THEIR GRAMMAR.

378
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,326
AND THEY DON'T LIKE IT

379
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,328
WHEN YOU EXPLAIN WHY YOUR JOKES ARE FUNNY.

380
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,331
YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU KEEP ASKING THEM

381
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,333
IF THEY LIKE YOU.

382
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,335
MAN, I AM SO LUCKY I HAVE MONICA.

383
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,338
I'M NEVER GOING TO FIND LOVE AGAIN.

384
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,843
HEY.

385
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,845
PHOEBE, CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

386
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:06,846
SURE.

387
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,850
OKAY, UM, I...

388
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,853
ALL RIGHT, PHOEBE, LOOK--

389
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,855
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I'M SORRY, OKAY?

390
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,357
I HANDLED THE SITUATION HORRIBLY

391
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,860
AND AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE LIED TO YOU.

392
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,863
SO, WHAT SHOULD YOU HAVE DONE?

393
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,365
WELL, I I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH.

394
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,366
UH HUH...

395
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,868
WHICH IS?

396
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,369
WELL, YOU KNOW...

397
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,874
THE REASON THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO GO RUNNING WITH YOU IS

398
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,376
BECAUSE, UH, WELL, YOU KNOW, THE WAY THAT YOU RUN

399
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,878
IS JUST A LITTLE...

400
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,882
SO?

401
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,383
WELL, IT'S EMBARRASSING.

402
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,385
PEOPLE WERE LOOKING AT US LIKE WE WERE CRAZY.

403
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,386
WHY DO YOU CARE?

404
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,388
BECAUSE THEY'RE PEOPLE.

405
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,391
BUT PEOPLE THAT YOU DON'T KNOW AND WILL NEVER SEE AGAIN.

406
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,394
YES, BUT STILL, THEY ARE PEOPLE...

407
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,396
WITH EYES.

408
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,399
WELL, I DIDN'T GET EMBARRASSED RUNNING NEXT TO MISS...

409
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,901

410
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,404
BUT, OH, OKAY.

411
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,907
NO, NO, I CAN SEE WHY RUNNING WITH ME

412
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,408
WOULD BE EMBARRASSING TO YOU.

413
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,910
YEAH, OKAY.

414
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,911
YOU'RE UPTIGHT.

415
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,912
WH...!

416
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,913
I... LIS...

417
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,914
I AM NOT UPTIGHT...

418
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,415
NO...

419
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,918
LISTEN, I AM NOT...

420
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,921
UPTIGHT, MAN.

421
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,922
THAT'S OKAY, RACHEL.

422
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,423
I'M NOT JUDGING YOU.

423
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,925
THAT'S JUST WHO YOU ARE.

424
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,426
ME, I'M MORE FREE, YOU KNOW?

425
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,428
I RUN LIKE I DID WHEN I WAS A KID

426
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,931
BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY  WAY IT'S FUN, YOU KNOW?

427
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,432
I MEAN, DIDN'T YOU EVER RUN SO FAST

428
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,935
YOU THOUGHT YOUR LEGS WERE GOING TO FALL OFF?

429
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,438
YOU KNOW, LIKE WHEN YOU WERE RUNNING TOWARD THE SWINGS

430
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,941
OR OR RUNNING AWAY FROM SATAN?

431
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,945
THE NEIGHBORS' DOG.

432
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,947
OH.

433
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,451
OKAY, IS THIS LAMP IN THE RIGHT PLACE?

434
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:56,455
WHO CARES? I REPEL WOMEN.

435
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,457
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

436
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,458
YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE.

437
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,961
R R ROSS IS NAKED!

438
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,964
WHAT?!

439
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,465
WHAT?!

440
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,467
I COULDN'T SAY THAT I WAS NAKED

441
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,469
BECAUSE SHE'S ALLOWED TO SEE ME NAKED.

442
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,472
WHY DOES ANYONE HAVE TO BE NAKED?

443
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,978
WHY IS ROSS NAKED?

444
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,983
I... I HAD TO... SHOW CHANDLER SOMETHING.

445
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,486
NAKED?

446
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,489
YEAH, I I, UH...

447
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,992
I GUESS I HAVE A, UH...

448
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,495
A GUY PROBLEM.

449
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,497
IS IT THE SAME THING THAT CHANDLER HAD?

450
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,003
LOOK, UH, JUST JUST COME BACK LATER.

451
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,504
WE'LL GET EVERYTHING SQUARED AWAY

452
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,006
AND YOU CAN COME BACK LATER.

453
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,507
OKAY.

454
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,010
HEY, LISTEN, THERE'S STILL SOME OF CHANDLER'S MEDICINE LEFT

455
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,512
UNDER THE SINK IN THE BATHROOM. BYE.

456
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,513
BYE BYE.

457
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,020
THANK GOD.

458
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,525
DUDE, WHAT'D YOU HAVE?

459
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,029
LOOK, WE HAVE NO TIME, OKAY?

460
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,530
WE MUST FOCUS.

461
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,032
WE GOT TO GET EVERYTHING BACK

462
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,533
INTO ITS ORIGINAL PLACE.

463
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,035
THE PHOTO ALBUM.

464
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,537
THERE WERE MILLIONS OF PICTURES OF THE APARTMENT

465
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,039
IN THE PHOTO ALBUM.

466
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,541
WE JUST GO THROUGH IT AND MATCH EVERYTHING TO THE PICTURES.

467
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,542
THAT'S PERFECT.

468
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,543
THAT'S BRILLIANT.

469
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,549
SO, REALLY, WHAT'D YOU HAVE?

470
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,553
HEY, JOEY, I GOT SOME BEER FOR YOU.

471
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:40,559
UH, DON'T DON'T YOU MEAN, "FOR WHOM"?

472
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,061
SURE.

473
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,563
LISTEN, I WAS GOING TO ORDER SOME PIZZA.

474
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,065
YOU WANT TO SHARE ONE?

475
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,567
PIZZA? HA! IT'S NOT LIKE I'VE NEVER HAD THAT BEFORE.

476
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,069
BA DUM BUMP. CHSSH.

477
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,073
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

478
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:59,578
YEAH, I'M DEPRESSED ABOUT THAT IRISH POTATO FAMINE.

479
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,080
NO, I MEAN WITH ME

480
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,083
BECAUSE YOU SEEM TO BE ACTING REALLY WEIRD AROUND ME.

481
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,085
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

482
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,588
LET'S JUST GET THIS OUT IN THE OPEN, OKAY?

483
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,590
YOU'RE HOT.

484
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,093
I'M LOVABLE.

485
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,097
CLEARLY, THERE'S A VIBE GOING ON BETWEEN US

486
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,598
BUT WE'RE ROOMMATES

487
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:24,103
AND IT'S A HUGE MISTAKE FOR US TO CONTINUE DOWN THIS ROAD.

488
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,104
JOEY...

489
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,106
NO, NO, NO, I'M TELLING YOU.

490
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,608
IMAGINE YOURSELF LIVING IN A SUPERMARKET

491
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,611
AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND.

492
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,614
OKAY, SO THE QUESTION IS, WHAT DO WE DO?

493
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,117
WELL, I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING TO DO.

494
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,119
I MEAN, I THINK YOU'RE REALLY SWEET

495
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,122
BUT I'M JUST NOT INTERESTED IN YOU LIKE THAT.

496
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,628
OH!

497
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,130
NO, I MEAN...

498
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,632
YOU'RE A REALLY NICE GUY

499
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,634
AND I'M HAPPY TO BE YOUR ROOMMATE

500
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,635
AND YOUR FRIEND.

501
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,137
I'M JUST...

502
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,641
YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT YOU.

503
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,145
OH... I SEE WHAT HAPPENED.

504
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,646

505
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,649
IT'S BECAUSE I WAS TRYING TO REPEL YOU, RIGHT?

506
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,654
BELIEVE ME, YOU'D FEEL A LOT DIFFERENT IF I TURNED IT ON.

507
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,656
I DON'T THINK SO.

508
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,158
OH, I DO.

509
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,163
HOW YOU DOING?

510
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,166
I'M OKAY.

511
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,169
WHAT?

512
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,171
WHAT?

513
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,673
OH, DEAR GOD!

514
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,180

515
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,192

516
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,193
HEY! HEY!

517
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,194
PHEEBS!

518
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,196
OH, HONEY, I'M SO SORRY.

519
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,697
YOU WERE RIGHT-- THIS FEELS GREAT!

520
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,699
SEE? AND YOU DON'T CARE IF PEOPLE ARE STARING.

521
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,202
IT'S JUST FOR A SECOND, BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE GONE!

522
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,203
GONE!

523
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,704
I MEAN, IT'S AMAZING, PHEEBS!

524
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,706
I FEEL SO FREE, AND SO GRACEFUL...

525
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,707
AAH!

526
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,713
HEY! LOOK OUT FOR THE HORSE.

527
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,714
SORRY.

528
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,721
IS IT OKAY FOR ME TO COME IN NOW?

529
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,224
UH HUH.

530
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,731
WHY IS EVERYTHING DIFFERENT?

531
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,732
BYE.

532
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,736
NO, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING DIFFERENT

533
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,739
OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT THE ROOM GOT SO MUCH BRIGHTER

534
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,740
WHEN YOU CAME INTO IT.

535
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,742

536
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,245
WELL, THE END TABLE IS WRONG AND THE COUCH LOOKS BIZARRE

537
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,748
AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE REFRIGERATOR MAGNETS.

538
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:53,252
OKAY, LOOK, DON'T... DON'T BE MAD, OKAY?

539
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,754
BUT AFTER I UNPACKED THE BOXES

540
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,757
I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING NICE FOR YOU

541
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,759
SO I I I CLEANED THE APARTMENT.

542
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,262
SO I MOVED EVERYTHING AROUND

543
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,265
AND THEN I I FORGOT WHERE IT... WHERE IT WENT BACK.

544
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,766
AND I'M SORRY.

545
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,268
I'M VERY SORRY, I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

546
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,270
THAT'S OKAY.

547
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,773
CHANDLER, ARE YOU AFRAID OF ME OR SOMETHING?

548
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,776
DO YOU WANT ME TO BE AFRAID OF YOU?

549
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,778
OF COURSE NOT.

550
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,281
OH, MY GOSH, CHANDLER, WHAT YOU DID--

551
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,285
IT'S IT'S SUCH A WONDERFUL THING AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

552
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,287
I KNOW I HAVE THIS WEIRD THING
