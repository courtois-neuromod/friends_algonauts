1
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:05,305
JOEY, WOULD YOU SLOW DOWN?

2
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:07,307
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE SOLD OUT OF PAPERS

3
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:08,508
AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING.

4
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,709
I'M EXCITED.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,711
I'VE NEVER GOTTEN REVIEWED BEFORE.

6
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:13,713
YOU WERE SO AMAZING AS THE KING.

7
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:14,914
I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED. I WAS.

8
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:16,516
ALTHOUGH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

9
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,719
YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER WEARING UNDERWEAR NEXT TIME.

10
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:20,820
YEAH, BECAUSE WHEN

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,822
YOU SAT DOWN ON YOUR THRONE

12
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:26,026
YOU COULD KIND OF SEE YOUR... ROYAL SUBJECTS.

13
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,728
COME ON, NO ONE WORE UNDERWEAR BACK THEN.

14
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:31,531
I'M SURE THE CRITICS APPRECIATED YOUR AUTHENTICITY.

15
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,933
NICE GENITALS, BY THE WAY.

16
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,935
THANKS, MAN.

17
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:37,537

JOEY, HONEY, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

33

MAYBE THEY DO.

34
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,177
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS TEN YEARS

35
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,179
AND I HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANYWHERE.

36
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,780
THERE'S GOT TO BE A REASON.

37
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,583
COME ON, MAN, YOU'RE JUST PAYING YOUR DUES.

38
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,784
NO, NO. IT'S TOO HARD.

39

IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

40
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,187
I QUIT.

41
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,488

42
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,490
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT ONE MINUTE.

43
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,691
WAIT A MINUTE.

I DON'T KNOW.

BUT THEN I FOUND OUT YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR HANDS

66
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,162
INTO COWS AND STUFF.

67
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,363
HI.

68
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,964
 HEY.

00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,866
 ARE ARE YOU OKAY?

70
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,269
YEAH, YEAH, JUST A TOUGH DAY AT WORK.

THIS IS FUN BOBBY'S JACKET.

00:02:58,878 --> 00:02:59,679
HE'S HERE, ISN'T HE?

76
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,480
MAYBE.

77
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,681
DON'T TOY WITH ME.

GELLER!

79
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,284
FUN BOBBY!

00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,686
HEY! WHOA, YOU BEEN WORKING OUT, HUH?

81
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,887
NOT AT ALL.

82
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,389
I LOVE THIS GUY.

83
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,990
HEY, I WAS SO PSYCHED

84
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,793
TO HEAR YOU'RE BACK WITH MY SISTER.

85
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,395
YOU AND ME BOTH.

86
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,996
HEY, SO WHAT DID I MISS? WHAT DID I MISS? COME ON.

87
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,598
WE WERE JUST TRYING TO MAKE JOEY FEEL BETTER.

88
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,700
HEY, DO YOU NEED ME TO PICK YOU UP?

89
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,702
NO, I'M ALL RIGHT, MAN, REALLY.

90
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,304
NO, I'M PICKING YOU UP.

91
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,507
HEY, NO, SERIOUSLY, I DON'T NEED YOU TO...

92
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,509

93
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,510
ALL RIGHT!

94
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,711
IT STILL WORKS.

95
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,113
OKAY. NOW, BEFORE I GO, DOES ANYBODY ELSE NEED

96
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,715
TO BE PICKED UP?

97
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,916
I'M STILL GOING TO GO.

98
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,319
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU LATER, BABE.

99
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,822
PUBLIC DISPLAY OF AFFECTION COMING UP.

100
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,424
YOU CAN AVERT YOUR EYES.

101
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,032
SEE YA.

102
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,634
GOOD BYE.

103
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,736
FUN BOBBY IS SO GREAT.

104
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,737
OH, ISN'T HE?

105
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:01,341
I REALLY THINK, THIS TIME, IT MAY WORK WITH HIM.

106
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,942
I MEAN, HE JUST MAKES ME FEEL SO GOOD

107
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,544
AND I'VE BEEN FEELING SO LOUSY

108
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,347
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS-- NO JOB, NO BOYFRIEND.

109
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,948
WELL, AT LEAST MY CUP IS HALF FULL.

110
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,651
HALF FULL OF LOVE.

111
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:15,255
AND FOR OUR TWO WEEK ANNIVERSARY HE'S GOING TO TAKE ME

112
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,057
TO HIS COUSIN'S CABIN FOR THE WEEKEND.

113
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,460
CABIN OF LOVE.

114
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,664
WE WENT THROUGH A LOT OF WINE TONIGHT, YOU GUYS.

115
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,165
REALLY? I ONLY HAD TWO GLASSES.

116
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:27,367
I JUST HAD A GLASS.

117
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,568
TWO.

118
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:29,569
I HAD ONE GLASS.

119
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,571
I HAD ABOUT A MUGFUL IN THIS LOVELY

120
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,374
"I GOT BONED AT THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY" MUG.

121
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,276
OKAY, SO THAT'S...

122
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,478
THAT'S, WHAT, TWO BOTTLES

123
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,681
AND YET, SOMEHOW WE WENT THROUGH FIVE?

124
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,888
OH. OOH.

125
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,691
OH.

126
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,793
SO WHAT?

127
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,195
SO HE DRANK A LOT TONIGHT.

128
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,797
YEAH, BUT

129
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,400
YOU KNOW, NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, I DON'T THINK

130
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,202
I'VE EVER SEEN FUN BOBBY WITHOUT A DRINK IN HIS HAND.

131
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:04,904
YEAH, AND OOH

132
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,806
YEAH, YOU KNOW, DID YOU NOTICE

133
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:11,210
HOW HE ALWAYS STARTS HIS STORIES WITH, "OKAY, I WAS SO WASTED"

134
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,013
OR, "WE WERE SO BOMBED," OR, "SO I WAKE UP

135
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,816
AND I'M IN THIS DUMPSTER IN CONNECTICUT."

136
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,418
MONICA, HAVE YOU

137
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,220
EVER BEEN WITH HIM WHEN HE WASN'T DRINKING?

138
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,623
WELL, WE JUST HAPPEN TO GO TO A LOT OF PLACES

139
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:24,824
WHERE YOU MIGHT DRINK.

140
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,226
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU GO TO A WINE TASTING

141
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,228
WITHOUT HAVING A DRINK?

142
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:33,032
OR TO A CLUB, OR TO THE... ZOO?

143
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,839
RACH, DOES THIS HAVE NON FAT MILK?

144
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,040
UM...

145
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,142
I DON'T KNOW. WHY DON'T YOU TASTE IT?

146
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,146
MMM. NO.

147
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,349
OH, WELL, TOO LATE. SORRY.

148
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,050
YOU ALREADY HAD SOME.

149
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,755
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE MAKE THESE COFFEES IRISH?

150
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,358

151
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,258
UM...

152
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,260
CAKE!

153
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,464
YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO GET SOME CAKE.

154
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:08,067
YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN MAKING

155
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,270
AN AWFUL LOT OF STUFF "IRISH" LATELY.

156
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,074
WELL, I WOULD MAKE THEM BELGIAN, BUT THE WAFFLES

157
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,676
ARE HARD TO GET INTO THAT FLASK.

158
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:17,877
BOBBY.

159
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,078
YEAH, OKAY.

160
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:21,481
LOOK, MAYBE THIS IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS

161
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,483
OR MAYBE IT IS, I DON'T KNOW

162
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,285
BUT, UM, I'M KIND OF WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

163
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:29,088
OKAY, LOOK, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME SOMEBODY'S

164
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,090
SAID SOMETHING TO ME ABOUT THIS

165
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,291
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

166
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,893
I ALWAYS MADE EXCUSES ABOUT IT

167
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,895
LIKE "I'M JUST A SOCIAL DRINKER."

168
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,297
OR "HEY, COME ON, IT'S FLAG DAY."

169
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,901
SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING NOW?

170
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:45,505
I GUESS I'M SAYING I'LL TRY AND QUIT.

171
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:49,509
I KIND OF LIKE THAT YOU WORRY ABOUT ME.

172
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,214
SO, WHAT'S GOING ON, HUH?

173
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,817
I AM GOING TO TRY AND QUIT DRINKING.

174
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,419
OH, WHY?

175
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,222
HEY.

176
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,224
HEY.

177
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,426
HEY. HEY.

178
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,027
GUESS WHO'S BACK IN SHOW BUSINESS?

179
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,430
OOH! OOH! LORNE GREENE?

180
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,033
NO. NO, PHEEBS. YOU KNOW WHY?

181
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,234
BECAUSE HE'S DEAD.

182
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,736
OH, NO.

183
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:21,441
OKAY, I GUESS IT'S GOING TO SEEM KIND OF BITTERSWEET NOW

184
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,042
BUT JOEY, THAT'S WHO.

185
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,644
OH! REALLY? MY AGENT

186
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,647
JUST CALLED ME WITH AN AUDITION FOR DAYS OF OUR LIVES.

187
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,148
YES!

188
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,551
HERE'S TO JOEY!

189
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,353
HERE, JOEY!

190
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,258
OH, WELL, WE HAVE TO CELEBRATE.

191
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,059
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO?

192
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,061
WE SHOULD DO, LIKE, A SOAP OPERA THEME.

193
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:45,765
HEY, YEAH. WE COULD ALL SLEEP TOGETHER, AND THEN ONE OF US

194
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:46,966

212
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,002
ARE YOU STILL MAD AT HIM BECAUSE HE MADE THAT LIST ABOUT YOU?

213
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,104
NO, NO, I'M NOT MAD AT HIM.

00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:28,708
I'M NOT REALLY ANYTHING AT HIM ANYMORE.

216
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,110

OH, I KNOW. I'M SORRY, YOU GUYS.

220
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,921
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO GET USED TO THE FACT

00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,523

OKAY, OKAY. DON'T GET ALL SQUINKY.

302
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,437

RUSS, YOU READY?

377
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,720
YEAH.

378
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,922
BYE.

379
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,523
BYE.

380
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,627
SHE'S DATING?

381
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,629
SHE'S DATING?

382
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,832
YES. YES, BUT DID YOU SEE WHO SHE WAS DATING?

383
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,834
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

384
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,337
DO YOU NOT SEE IT?

385
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:41,140
SEE WHAT? I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE SEES IN... THAT GOOBER.

386
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,244
AND IT... AND IT TAKES HIM, WHAT?

387
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,646
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, UH, UH, HELLO

388
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,049
A WEEK TO GET OUT A SENTENCE?

389
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,051
YEAH, IT'S ANNOYING, ISN'T IT?

390
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,055
YEAH.

391
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,762
HEY.

392
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:04,964
HEY.

393
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,167
WHOA, WHOA. SO I'M GUESSING YOU DIDN'T GET THE PART.

394
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:11,770
OR ITALY CALLED AND SAID IT WAS HUNGRY.

395
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,374
THE PART'S MINE IF I WANT IT.

396
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:16,976
OH, MY GOD!

397
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,179
YEAH, IF I'M WILLING TO SLEEP WITH THE CASTING LADY.

398
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,181
OH, MY...

399
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,782
GOD.

400
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,784
TEN YEARS I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A BREAK

401
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,786
LIKE THIS, CHANDLER-- TEN YEARS.

402
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,788
I MEAN, DAYS OF OUR LIVES--

403
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,790
THAT'S ACTUALLY ON TELEVISION.

404
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,093
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

405
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,395
I GUESS I COULD SLEEP WITH HER.

406
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,697
BUT HOW CAN I DO THAT?

407
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,299
WELL, I'VE GOT A POP UP BOOK

408
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,701
THAT TOLD ME EVERYTHING I NEED TO KNOW.

409
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,604
I'VE NEVER SLEPT WITH SOMEONE FOR A PART.

410
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,306
WELL, IS SHE..?

411
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,309
SORRY.

412
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,910
IS SHE GOOD LOOKING?

413
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,912
YEAH, SHE'S TOTALLY GOOD LOOKING.

414
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,715
I MEAN, IF I MET HER IN A BAR OR SOMETHING

415
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,118
I'D BE BUYING HER BREAKFAST.

416
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,122
YOU KNOW, AFTER HAVING SLEPT WITH HER.

417
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,929
YOU KNOW, MAYBE THIS ISN'T SUCH A BIG DEAL.

418
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,931
I MEAN, THE WAY THAT I SEE IT

419
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:16,935
IS YOU GET A GREAT JOB AND YOU GET TO HAVE SEX.

420
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,738
THROW IN A TREE AND A FAT GUY

421
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,740
AND YOU'VE GOT CHRISTMAS.

422
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:27,746
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT I WANT IT THAT WAY THOUGH, YOU KNOW?

423
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,149
I MEAN, LET'S SAY I DO MAKE IT, ALL RIGHT?

424
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,551
I'M ALWAYS GOING TO LOOK BACK AND WONDER

425
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,553
IF IT WAS BECAUSE OF MY TALENT

426
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,555
OR BECAUSE OF, YOU KNOW...

427
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,157
THE LITTLE GENERAL.

428
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,959
DIDN'T YOU USED TO CALL IT THE "LITTLE MAJOR"?

429
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:44,963
YEAH, BUT AFTER DENISE DiMARCO, I HAD TO PROMOTE IT.

430
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,272
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING FROM THE BAR?

431
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,273
YES, I WOULD LIKE SOMETHING.

432
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:57,476
NO. NO, THANK YOU.

433
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,478
IF YOU WANT A DRINK, IT'S OKAY WITH ME.

434
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,480
I'VE GOT TO GET USED TO IT.

435
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,583
NO, REALLY, I WOULDN'T FEEL RIGHT ABOUT IT.

436
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,785
JUST SOME WATER, PLEASE.

437
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,587
THE LIGHT WENT OUT IN MY REFRIGERATOR.

438
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,390
I'D LIKE A SCOTCH ON THE ROCKS WITH A TWIST.

439
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,392
I'M SORRY.

440
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,994
HEY, WE'RE HAVING SOME FUN NOW, HUH, ROSS?

441
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,397
WANT TO DO ANOTHER ONE, HUH, RUSS?

442
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:23,102
OKAY, 11 LETTERS.

443
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,104
"ATOMIC ELEMENT NUMBER 101."

444
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,705
ENDS IN "IUM".

445
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,307
DYSPROSIUM?

446
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,908
DYSPROSIUM?

447
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,910
TRY MENDELEVIUM.

448
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,513
AND WEENIE NUMBER TWO HAS IT.

449
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,416
UNLESS, OF COURSE, NINE DOWN-- "KNIGHTS IN WHITE SATIN"

450
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,018
WAS SUNG BY THE DOODY BLUES.

451
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,821
YOU DON'T SEE IT?

452
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,624
YOU ACTUALLY DON'T SEE IT?

453
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,825
WHAT?

454
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,627
OKAY, HONEY, YOU'RE DATING ROSS.

455
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,629
NO, PHEEBS, I'M DATING RUSS.

456
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,231
RUSS IS ROSS.

457
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,432
RUSS, ROSS.

458
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,033
STEVE, SLEEVE.

459
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,636
OKAY, NO ONE IS NAMED SLEEVE.

460
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,938
PHOEBE, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

461
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,940
OTHER THAN THEIR NAMES BEING SIMILAR

462
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,743
I'M SORRY, I DO NOT SEE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING.

463
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,645
FOR YOUR INFORMATION

464
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,348
IT'S A CARD SHARP, NOT A CARD SHARK.

465
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,049
YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG.

466
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,452
YOU COULD TRY, BUT YOU WOULD NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

467
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:16,255
OKAY, I'M GOING TO GET SOME MORE COFFEE

468
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,657
BEFORE THE PINCHING AND EYE POKING BEGINS.

469
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,860
I KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS.

470
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,462
OH, YOU DO, DO YOU?

471
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,963
MM HMM. YOU'RE JEALOUS.

472
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,066
UH... OF WHAT?

473
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,568
YOU'RE JEALOUS

474
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,970
BECAUSE I'M A REAL DOCTOR.

475
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,474
HEY, YOU'RE A DOCTOR OF GUMS.

476
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:38,677
THAT'S THE SMALLEST BODY PART YOU CAN MAJOR IN.

477
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,379
IT'S LIKE, DAY ONE: FLOSS.

478
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,081
DAY TWO: HERE'S YOUR DIPLOMA.

479
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,283
YOU LISTEN...

480
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,684
NO, NO, LET ME FINISH.

481
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,686
NO, LET ME FINISH.

482
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,088
NO, YOU LET ME FINISH.

483
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:50,689
HI.

484
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,890
HI.

485
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,294
EW.

486
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,796
EW, EW, EW, EW, EW, EW, EW...

487
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,102
DID JOEY SAY WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO WHEN HE LEFT?

488
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,205
NO. I DON'T EVEN THINK HE KNEW.

489
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,007
HEY, WOULD YOU SLEEP WITH SOMEBODY TO GET A GREAT JOB?

490
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:12,110
I DON'T KNOW. WHO WOULD I HAVE TO SLEEP WITH?

491
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,112
ME.

492
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:17,516
WHY WOULD I HAVE TO SLEEP WITH YOU?

493
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,118
IT'S MY GAME. YOU WANT THE JOB, OR NOT?

494
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,421
HI.

495
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,622
HEY.

496
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:24,823
GOOD MORNING.

497
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,425
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

498
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,827
BOBBY AND I ARE GOING AWAY FOR THE WEEKEND, REMEMBER?

499
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:29,628
OH!

500
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,930
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE BOTTLES OF LIQUOR?

501
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:32,731
EXCUSE ME, MISS

502
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,133
IN THE EVENT OF A WATER LANDING

503
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:38,637
CAN THIS SEAT BE USED AS A FLOATATION DEVICE?

504
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:40,639
WHAT'S GOING ON?

505
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,441
IS BOBBY DRINKING AGAIN?

506
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:45,043
NO, THIS IS NOT FOR HIM; THIS IS FOR ME.

507
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,445
THAT WAY

508
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,646
HE'S STILL SOBER

509
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:52,050
BUT I FIND HIS STORIES ABOUT SHOELACES MUCH MORE AMUSING.

510
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,354

511
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,956
GOD, EVEN HIS KNOCK IS BORING.

512
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,960
HI. I'LL BE READY IN A SECOND.

513
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,363
COULD I TALK TO YOU A MINUTE?

514
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:05,163
SURE.

515
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,667
THIS IS REALLY HARD FOR ME TO SAY.

516
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,669
OH, GOD! YOU FELL OFF THE WAGON.

517
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:11,870
NO, NO.

518
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,672
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

519
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,274
WHAT ABOUT ME?

520
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,076
I THINK YOU MAY HAVE A DRINKING PROBLEM.

521
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,482
WHAT? THESE?

522
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,285
NO, THESE ARE, UM... FOR CUTS AND SCRAPES.

523
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,687
LOOK, I AM JUST NOT STRONG ENOUGH

524
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,490
TO BE IN A CO DEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

525
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,293
OH, SHOOT.

526
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,898
WELL, ANYWAY, I HOPE WE CAN BE FRIENDS.

527
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,500
OKAY.

528
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:44,703
TAKE CARE.

529
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,305
OKAY, YOU TOO.

530
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,506
BYE.

531
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,511
WHAT HAPPENED?

532
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:56,014
WELL, WE KIND OF BROKE UP.

533
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,716
 OH...

534
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,523
DOES ANYBODY WANT THESE?

535
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,925
I'LL TAKE ONE.

536
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:10,329
SOMETIMES I LIKE TO HOLD STUFF LIKE THIS

537
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,731
AND PRETEND I'M A GIANT.

538
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,734
HEY.

539
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,736
HOW'D THE CALLBACK GO?

540
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,237
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

541
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,640
I WALKED IN THERE, AND SHE WAS ALL OVER ME.

542
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,841
SO, WHAT'D YOU DO?

543
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,042
WELL, I COULDN'T DO IT.

544
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,345
I TOLD HER I DIDN'T WANT TO GET THE PART THAT WAY.

545
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,145
GOOD FOR YOU. WOW.

546
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,147
BUT WAIT, WAIT. BUT THEN AFTER I LEFT

547
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,249
HER OFFICE, SHE CAUGHT UP WITH ME AT THE ELEVATOR

548
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,251
AND OFFERED ME AN EVEN BIGGER PART.

549
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,853
SO, AND?

550
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,255
SO, YOU ARE NOW LOOKING

551
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:40,459
AT DR. DRAKE RAMORAY, NEUROSURGEON

552
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,461
RECURRING IN AT LEAST FOUR EPISODES!

553
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,763

554
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,865
ALL RIGHT, I GOT TO GO SHOWER.

555
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,379

00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:09,588
ALL SHE SAID WAS THAT I REMIND HER TOO MUCH OF SOMEBODY.
