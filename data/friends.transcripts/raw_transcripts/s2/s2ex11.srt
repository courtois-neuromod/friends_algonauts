1
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:03,903
OKAY, HERE'S HIS DIAPER BAG

2
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:07,507
AND HIS, UH, MR. WINKY

3
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,909
AND, UH... OH.

4
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:11,811
HIM. HI.

5
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,213
SO HOW DID EVERYTHING GO?

6
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,414
OH, GREAT. GREAT.

7
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:18,418
THERE WAS A PROJECTILE, UH, THROWING UP INCIDENT

8
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,020
BUT HE STARTED IT.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,021

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,222
WELL, WE'VE GOT TO GO.

11
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,023
OKAY.

12
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,224

13
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:25,425
OH, RIGHT.

14
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,027
UM, I'VE GOT SOME NEWS.

15
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,228
IT'S ABOUT US.

16
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,329
OH, YOU AND ME?

17
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,531
UH, NO, SUSAN AND ME.

18
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,533
THE OTHER US.

19
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,335
OKAY.

20
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,337
WE'RE, UH...

21
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,339
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

22
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,548
AS IN "I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU WIFE AND WIFE" MARRIED?

23
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,250
ANYWAY, WE'D LIKE YOU TO COME

24
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,453
BUT WE TOTALLY UNDERSTAND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

25
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,555
YEAH. WELL, WHY WOULDN'T I WANT TO COME?

26
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,557
I HAD FUN AT THE FIRST WEDDING.

27
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,059
LOOK, I JUST THOUGHT...

28
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,260
NO, NO, NO, NO.

29
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,262
I MEAN, HEY, WHY SHOULDN'T I BE HAPPY FOR YOU?

30
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:05,065
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, WHAT WOULD IT SAY ABOUT ME

31
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,967
IF I COULDN'T, UH, REVEL IN YOUR JOY--

32
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,770
AND I'M REVELING, BABY, BELIEVE ME.

33
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,573
IS YOUR FINGER CAUGHT IN THAT CHAIR?

34
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,575
MM HMM.

35
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,376
WANT US TO GO?

36
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:17,577
UH HUH.

50
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,128
THIS IS SO COOL.

51
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,530
YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE ON TELEVISION.

52
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,932
I KNOW. IT REALLY HIT ME LAST NIGHT.

53
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,934
I'M GOING TO BE ON DAYS OF OUR LIVES.

54
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,938
AND THEN I STARTED THINKING ABOUT ALL OF US

55
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:21,341
AND HOW THESE ARE THE DAYS OF OUR LIVES.

56
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,843
YOU KNOW?

57
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,044
YES!

58
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,646
 WHAT?

59
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,148
CAROL AND SUSAN'S CATERER

60
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,550
HAD A MOUNTAIN BIKE ACCIDENT THIS WEEKEND

61
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,152
AND SHE'S IN A FULL BODY CAST.

62
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,954
YES! YES! YES!

63
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,556
THEY WANT ME TO DO IT, WHICH IS REALLY COOL

64
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,359
SEEING AS I'VE NEVER CATERED BEFORE AND I REALLY NEED THE MONEY

65
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,960
AND THIS ISN'T A PROBLEM FOR YOU, IS IT?

66
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,162
WOULD IT MATTER?

67
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:43,763
OH, YOU ARE SO GREAT.

68
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:44,964
THANK YOU.

69
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,166
ARE YOU REALLY NOT GOING?

70
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,267
I'M REALLY NOT GOING.

71
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,468
I MEAN, I DON'T GET IT.

72
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,069
THEY ALREADY LIVE TOGETHER.

73
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,671
WHY DO THEY NEED TO GET MARRIED?

74
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,273
BECAUSE THEY LOVE EACH OTHER

75
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,275
AND THEY WANT TO CELEBRATE THAT LOVE

76
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,677
WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CLOSE WITH THEM.

77
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,480
IF YOU WANT TO CALL THAT A REASON.

78
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,184
? WHO'S THE BITTEREST MAN IN THE LIVING ROOM? ?

79
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,787
? THE BITTEREST MAN IN THE LIVING ROOM? ?

80
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,190
HI, NEIGHBOR.

81
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,194
ROSS, I THOUGHT YOU WERE OVER THIS.

82
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,196
LOOK, THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS, OKAY?

83
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:16,996
SHE'S MY EX WIFE.

84
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,598
IF SHE WERE MARRYING A GUY

85
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,600
NONE OF YOU WOULD EXPECT ME TO BE THERE.

86
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,502
HEY, IF SHE WERE MARRYING A GUY

87
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,504
SHE'D BE, LIKE, THE WORST LESBIAN EVER.

88
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,108
DID I MISS IT? DID I MISS IT?

89
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:32,512
NO, NO, I'M ON RIGHT AFTER THIS GUY SHOOTS HIMSELF.

90
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,514
WHOA, SHE'S PRETTY.

91
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,315
YEAH.

92
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,217
OH, AND SHE'S REALLY NICE, TOO.

93
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,619
SHE TAUGHT ME ALL ABOUT, YOU KNOW

94
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,221
HOW TO WORK WITH THE CAMERAS

95
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,822
AND "SMELL THE FART" ACTING.

96
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,123
HUH.

97
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:44,924
I'M SORRY...

98
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,926
WHAT? EXCUSE ME? WHAT?

99
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,928
"SMELL THE FART" ACTING.

100
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,132
IT'S LIKE YOU GOT SO MANY LINES

101
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,334
TO LEARN SO FAST

102
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,935
THAT SOMETIMES YOU NEED A MINUTE

103
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,537
TO REMEMBER YOUR NEXT ONE

104
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,439
SO WHILE YOU'RE THINKING OF IT

105
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,942
YOU TAKE THIS BIG PAUSE, WHERE YOU LOOK ALL INTENSE

106
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,544
YOU KNOW, LIKE THIS.

107
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,148
OKAY. OHH.

108
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,651

109
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,053
OH, HERE'S MY SCENE! HERE'S MY SCENE!

110
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:16,756
Mrs. Wallace?

111
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,557
Yes?

112
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:18,758
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray

113
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,360
your sister's neurosurgeon.

114
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,762
Tell me, is she going to be all right?

115
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,364
I'm afraid the situation

116
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,366
is much more dire than we'd expected.

117
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,569
Your sister is suffering from a...

118
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,477
a subcranial hematoma.

119
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,678

120
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:43,082
Perhaps we can discuss this further over coffee.

121
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,490
NICE!

122
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,691
EXCELLENT! GREAT!

123
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,192
YOU KNOW, FOR A MINUTE THERE

124
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,995
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO SMELL SOMETHING.

125
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:00,800
DO IT AGAIN!

126
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,001
ALL RIGHT.

127
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,904
"DAMN IT, BRAVERMAN, IT'S RIGHT THERE ON THE CHART."

128
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,506

129
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,408
THAT'S GREAT.

130
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,410
ALL RIGHT, I GOT TO GET TO WORK.

131
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,412
I GOT A BIG DINOSAUR BONE TO INSPECT.

132
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,613
NO, NO. NO, THAT'S ME.

133
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:14,814
OH, RIGHT.

134
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,617
OH.

135
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,418
HELLO.

136
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,820
OH. THANKS. I COULDN'T, UH...

137
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,624
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

138
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,825
UM, NO.

139
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,628
HUH UH. UM...

140
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,229
ONE OF MY CLIENTS DIED

141
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,831
ON THE MASSAGE TABLE TODAY.

142
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,032
OH!

143
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,233
OH, MY GOD.

144
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,536
THAT'S A LITTLE MORE RELAXED THAN YOU

145
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,537
WANT THEM TO GET.

146
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,738
YEAH, UH HUH.

147
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,941
UM, SHE WAS, YOU KNOW, 82 YEARS OLD

148
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,945
AND, UM, HER NAME WAS, UM, MRS. ADELMAN.

149
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,146
OH, HONEY.

150
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,949
YEAH, IT'S JUST SO STRANGE, I MEAN...

151
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,352
YOU KNOW, SHE PROBABLY WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND THOUGHT

152
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,354
"ALL RIGHT, SO I'LL HAVE SOME BREAKFAST

153
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,555
"AND I'LL TAKE A LITTLE WALK

154
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,156
AND THEN I'LL HAVE MY MASSAGE."

155
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,358
LITTLE DID SHE KNOW

156
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,360
GOD WAS THINKING, "OKAY, BUT THAT'S IT."

157
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,666
OHH! OH, BUT THE WEIRDEST THING WAS, OKAY...

158
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,469
I WAS CLEANSING HER AURA WHEN IT HAPPENED?

159
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:13,072
AND WHEN WHEN HER SPIRIT LEFT HER BODY

160
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,875
I DON'T THINK IT WENT VERY FAR.

161
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,677
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

162
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,780
I I I THINK IT WENT INTO ME.

163
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,090
GOD, THIS IS SO HARD.

164
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,493
I CAN'T DECIDE BETWEEN LAMB OR DUCK.

165
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,194
WELL, OF COURSE, LAMBS ARE SCARIER.

166
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,797
OTHERWISE, THE MOVIE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED

167
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:38,998
SILENCE OF THE DUCKS.

168
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,000
OKAY, WHO ORDERED WHAT?

169
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,604
OH, I BELIEVE I HAD THE HALF DRUNK CAPPUCCINO

170
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,006
WITH THE LIPSTICK ON THE RIM.

171
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,509
YES, AND THIS WITH THE CIGARETTE BUTT IN IT--

172
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,309
IS THAT DECAF?

173
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,211
OH, GOD.

174
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,414
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE SO UPTIGHT ABOUT YOUR MOM COMING.

175
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,416
I KNOW, BUT IT'S JUST IT'S THE FIRST TIME

176
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,617
AND I JUST DON'T WANT HER TO THINK

177
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,218
THAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T MARRY BARRY

178
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:00,820
MY LIFE IS TOTAL CRAP, YOU KNOW?

179
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,822
TALK ABOUT CRAP...

180
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,224
TRY LISTENING TO STELLA NEIDMAN TELL THE STORY

181
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:07,226
OF HER AND ROD STEIGER FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME.

182
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,331
I'M SORRY.

183
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,933
AT LEAST YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE

184
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,335
TO HEAR THE STUFF SHE SAYS IN MY HEAD.

185
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,140
UH, PHEEBS, HOW LONG DO YOU THINK

186
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,742
THIS LADY WILL BE WITH US?

187
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,144
I DON'T KNOW.

188
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,947
SHE OBVIOUSLY HAS SOME KIND OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

189
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,549
SIT UP!

190
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,053
THERE SHE IS!

191
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:34,954
MOM!

192
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,556
HI, SWEETIE!

193
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,759

194
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,761
OH...

195
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,564
SO THIS IS WHERE YOU WORK.

196
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,366
OH, IT'S WONDERFUL.

197
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,568
IS IT A LIVING ROOM?

198
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:49,769
IS IT A RESTAURANT?

199
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,370
WHO CAN TELL?

200
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,372
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S THE FUN.

201
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,173
PRETTY MUCH.

202
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,175
HERE, MEET MY FRIENDS.

203
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,978
MONICA! YOU LOOK GORGEOUS!

204
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,780
OH, MY, THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU

205
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,583
IT WAS EAT OR BE EATEN.

206
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,484
UH, THIS IS JOEY.

207
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,284
HI.

208
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,486
THIS IS PHOEBE.

209
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,286
HELLO.

210
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,488
AND THIS IS CHANDLER

211
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,089
AND YOU REMEMBER ROSS. HI.

212
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,390
OH, HELLO, ROSS.

213
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,592
HI, MRS. GREEN.

214
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:13,793
SO...

215
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:17,997
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY DAUGHTER IN THE APRON

216
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,499
WITH THE BIG JOB?

217
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,900
OH, MOM.

218
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,101
OH, HEY.

219
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,103
IF YOU DIDN'T POUR THE COFFEE

220
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,105
NO ONE WOULD HAVE ANYTHING TO DRINK.

221
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,608
BELIEVE ME.

222
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,809
SOMETIMES THAT HAPPENS.

223
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,012
THIS IS JUST SO EXCITING.

224
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,014
YOU KNOW, I NEVER WORKED.

225
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,817
I WENT STRAIGHT FROM MY FATHER'S HOUSE

226
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:41,020
TO THE SORORITY HOUSE TO MY HUSBAND'S HOUSE.

227
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,022
I AM JUST SO PROUD OF YOU.

228
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:43,823
OH, REALLY?

229
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:44,624
YES.

230
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,325
OH, LET'S MAKE A DAY OF IT.

231
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,327
WE'LL HAVE LUNCH, WE'LL SHOP

232
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,929
WE'LL GET OUR NAILS DONE.

233
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,531
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

234
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,933
OKAY, MOM, I HAVE TO WORK.

235
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:57,537
WHAT? NO ONE ELSE CAN POUR COFFEE?

236
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,338
I KNOW WHO IT IS

237
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,440
YOU REMIND ME OF--

238
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,742
EVELYN DERMER.

239
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,545
COURSE, THAT'S BEFORE SHE GOT THE LOUSY FACE LIFT.

240
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,547
NOW SHE LOOKS LIKE SOUPY SALES.

241
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:12,552
PHEEBS, WHO'S EVELYN DERMER?

242
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,753
I DON'T KNOW.

243
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,354
WHO'S SOUPY SALES?

244
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,759
 OH, MY GOD!

245
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,564
THERE'S AN UNATTRACTIVE NUDE MAN PLAYING THE CELLO.

246
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,965
YEAH, WELL, JUST BE GLAD

247
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,367
HE'S NOT PLAYING A SMALLER INSTRUMENT.

248
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,770

249
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,973
YOU HAVE SOME LIFE HERE, SWEETIE.

250
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,776
I KNOW, AND MOM, I REALIZE YOU AND DADDY WERE UPSET

251
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:37,977
WHEN I DIDN'T MARRY BARRY

252
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,579
AND GET THE BIG HOUSE IN THE SUBURBS

253
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,581
WITH ALL THE SECURITY AND EVERYTHING

254
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,383
BUT, GOD, THIS IS JUST SO MUCH BETTER FOR ME, YOU KNOW?

255
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,985
I DO KNOW.

256
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,387
YOU DIDN'T LOVE BARRY, HONEY

257
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,790
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU THIS HAPPY.

258
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,192
I LOOK AT YOU AND I THINK

259
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,194
"OH, THIS IS WHAT I WANT."

260
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,798
FOR... ME.

261
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:02,301
WELL, NOT JUST FOR YOU.

262
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:03,302
WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

263
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,805
I'M, UH...

264
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,608
CONSIDERING LEAVING YOUR FATHER.

265
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,213
ALL RIGHT, TELL ME IF THIS IS TOO CUTE...

266
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,414
LESBIAN WEDDING...

267
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,817
CHICKEN BREASTS.

268
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,221
OH, GOD.

269
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,223
I THINK I'M GOING TO BE SICK.

270
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,326
WHAT? IT'S NOT LIKE I'M PUTTING LITTLE NIPPLES ON THEM.

271
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,731
 OH, HONEY, I'M SORRY.

272
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,433
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD AT ME.

273
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,836
WHAT... WHAT CAN I DO?

274
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,037
YOU WANT ME TO MAKE

275
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,039
THOSE LITTLE MARSHMALLOW TREATS

276
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,641
YOU USED TO LIKE?

277
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,242
I CAN CALL UP CARMELLA

278
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,443
AND FIND OUT HOW.

279
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,846
MOM, I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

280
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,848
I THOUGHT YOU WERE HAPPY.

281
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,250
YEAH, WELL, SO DID I.

282
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,252
BUT... BUT YOU KNOW HOW SOMETIMES

283
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,854
YOU'RE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY

284
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,055
AND YOU GET HOME

285
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,657
AND YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY REMEMBER

286
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,258
HAVING DRIVEN THERE?

287
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,459
MM HMM.

288
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,862
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT MY LIFE HAS BEEN LIKE.

289
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:06,065
WELL, COULDN'T YOU LISTEN TO THE RADIO MORE?

290
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,068
I WISH IT WERE THAT EASY.

291
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,670
BUT THEN I SEE YOU HERE

292
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,271
AND I KEEP THINKING

293
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,973
WHY CAN'T I HAVE THIS?

294
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,574
I WANT ADVENTURES.

295
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,176
I WANT TO HANG OUT.

296
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,778
I WANT A CHANDLER.

297
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,379
OH, NO, MOM.

298
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,981
MOM, BELIEVE ME

299
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:25,184
CHANDLER IS NO REASON TO LEAVE DADDY.

300
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,786
I MEAN...

301
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,488
YOU THINK THIS LOOKS LIKE I'M HAVING A LOT OF FUN

302
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,891
BUT IT'S REALLY HARD. REALLY HARD.

303
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,092
I'VE GOT THIS LOUSY JOB

304
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,494
I BARELY KNOW IF I'M GOING TO MAKE RENT

305
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,096
AND FORGET ABOUT BUYING STUFF.

306
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,398
OH, HONEY, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

307
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,801
I'D BE DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING

308
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,402
BUT WITH MONEY.

309
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,906
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.

310
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,213
AND YOU HAD NO IDEA THEY WEREN'T GETTING ALONG?

311
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,014
NONE.

312
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,916
THEY DIDN'T FIGHT A LOT?

313
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,418
NO. THEY DIDN'T EVEN TALK TO EACH OTHER.

314
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,420
MY GOD, HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW

315
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,022
THEY WERE HAVING PROBLEMS?

316
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,826
YOU KNOW, IN MY DAY, DIVORCE WAS NOT AN OPTION.

317
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,029
HEY, LOOK WHO'S UP.

318
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,034
OH, I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING.

319
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,235
I MEAN, WHEN I WAS LITTLE

320
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,237
EVERYBODY'S PARENTS WERE GETTING DIVORCED, YOU KNOW?

321
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,839
I JUST FIGURED AS A GROWN UP

322
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,841
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THIS.

323
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,643
IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS AS FLATTERING?

324
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,446
SHE'S DOING IT BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO BE MORE LIKE YOU.

325
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:28,647
WELL, THEN, YOU KNOW

326
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:31,851
COULDN'T SHE HAVE JUST COPIED MY HAIRCUT?

327
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,052
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

328
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,454
WHEN MY PARENTS GOT DIVORCED, THEY SENT ME TO THIS SHRINK

329
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:36,655
AND SHE TOLD ME THAT ALL KIDS

330
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,257
HAVE A TENDENCY TO BLAME THEMSELVES

331
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,859
BUT IN YOUR CASE, IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF TRUE.

332
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:43,162
OOH, THAT'S HIM.

333
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,363
DAMN.

334
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,967
MY MAIL ORDER GRANDFATHER HASN'T COME YET.

335
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,568
PHOEBE? YES.

336
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,070
HI, MR. ADELMAN. NICE TO SEE YOU.

337
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,271
HI, THANKS FOR MEETING ME.

338
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,472
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT

339
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,275
ALTHOUGH YOU DID CUT INTO MY BUSY DAY OF SITTING.

340
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,276
OH.

341
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,678
OH, DO YOU WANT TO SIT?

342
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,280
OH, NO, NO. PLEASE.

343
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,882
I SPENT MOST OF MID MORNING

344
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,984
TRYING TO STAND UP.

345
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,386
NOW, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, MY DEAR?

346
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,189
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS, BUT, UM...

347
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:14,193
I THINK WHEN YOUR WIFE'S SPIRIT LEFT HER BODY

348
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,595
IT, UM... KIND OF STUCK AROUND...

349
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:17,797
IN ME.

350
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,399
YOU'RE SAYING MY WIFE IS IN YOU?

351
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,001
YEAH.

352
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,003
OKAY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BELIEVE ME

353
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,004
BUT CAN YOU THINK

354
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,406
OF ANY UNFINISHED BUSINESS SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD?

355
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,809
LIKE, ANY REASON SHE'D BE HANGING AROUND?

356
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,211
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU, DEAR.

357
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:35,414
THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF IS THAT SHE ALWAYS USED TO SAY

358
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:38,217
THAT BEFORE SHE DIED, SHE WANTED TO SEE EVERYTHING.

359
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,218
EVERYTHING?

360
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,820
EVERYTHING.

361
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,822
WHOA! THAT'S A LOT OF STUFF.

362
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,423
OH, WAIT!

363
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,424
I REMEMBER.

364
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,227
SHE ALSO SAID SHE WANTED TO SLEEP WITH ME

365
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,329
ONE LAST TIME.

366
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,037
UH, I'M SORRY.

367
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,439
THERE'S LAUGHING IN MY HEAD.

368
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,443
WORTH A SHOT, HUH?

369
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:13,552
 OH, LOOK AT THIS!

370
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:14,553
OH, THESE ARE ALL HALLOWEEN

371
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,155
THREE YEARS AGO.

372
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,356
MY LITTLE MARTINI.

373
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,258
I LOVE YOUR OLIVE HEAD.

374
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,862
OH, AND LOOK, HERE'S BARRY.

375
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,264
OH, DID HE HAVE TO COME STRAIGHT FROM THE OFFICE?

376
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,967
OH, NO. THAT WAS HIS COSTUME.

377
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,971
SEE, HE'S ACTUALLY AN ORTHODONTIST

378
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,773
BUT HE CAME AS A REGULAR DENTIST.

379
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,977
YEAH, HE THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY FUNNY.

380
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,979
YOU GUYS, REMEMBER WHEN I SAID BEFORE

381
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,381
"THANK YOU, BUT I DON'T REALLY NEED YOUR HELP"?

382
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,483
ACTUALLY, WHAT I THINK YOU SAID WAS

383
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,286
"DON'T TOUCH THAT AND GET THE HELL OUT OF MY KITCHEN."

384
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,188
REALLY? WEIRD.

385
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:52,391
ANYWAY, SEE, I PLANNED EVERYTHING REALLY WELL.

386
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,993
I PLANNED AND I PLANNED AND I PLANNED.

387
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,594
IT JUST TURNS OUT, I DON'T THINK I PLANNED

388
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,196
ENOUGH TIME TO ACTUALLY DO IT.

389
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,397
HEY, MON, YOU WANT SOME HELP?

390
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,099
IF YOU WANT.

391
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,103
HEY.

392
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:04,904
 HEY.

393
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,505
WHAT A DAY.

394
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,507
OH, I TOOK HER EVERYWHERE.

395
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,313
THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, ROCKEFELLER CENTER

396
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,915
THE STATUE OF LIBERTY.

397
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,616
SHE'S STILL WITH YOU.

398
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:18,717
YES.

399
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,120
I GUESS SHE HASN'T SEEN EVERYTHING YET.

400
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,721
OH, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

401
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,524
SHE HAS TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AGAIN.

402
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:30,729
OH, SUCH A PRETTY FACE.

403
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,132

404
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,534
OH, THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.

405
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:36,735
JUST THE GIRLS.

406
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,737
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO?

407
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,140
DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY MARIJUANA?

408
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,343
GOD! OH!

409
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,345
DID MY MOTHER JUST ASK IF WE HAVE POT?

410
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,546
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

411
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:51,150
NO ONE'S SMOKING POT AROUND ALL THIS FOOD.

412
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,751
WELL, THAT'S FINE.

413
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,353
I NEVER DID IT.

414
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,755
I JUST THOUGHT I MIGHT.

415
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,558
SO... WHAT'S NEW IN SEX?

416
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:00,759

417
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,263
WHAT'S NEW IN SEX?!

418
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:07,066
WELL, THE ONLY MAN I'VE EVER BEEN WITH IS YOUR FATHER.

419
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,567
I'M DICING. I'M DICING.

420
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,569
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.

421
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,272
I MEAN THIS AS NO OFFENSE TO YOUR DAD, SWEETIE

422
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,674
BUT I WAS THINKING THERE MIGHT BE MORE.

423
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,076
OH, I'M SORRY. YOU KNOW WHAT?

424
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,078
I CANNOT HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU.

425
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,279
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

426
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,581
GOD, YOU JUST COME IN, YOU DROP THIS BOMB ON ME

427
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:23,782
BEFORE YOU EVEN TELL DADDY.

428
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:24,984
WHAT? WHAT DO YOU WANT?

429
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,185
DO YOU WANT MY BLESSING?

430
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,387
YOU WANT ME TO TALK YOU OUT OF IT? NO.

431
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,989
THEN WHAT? WHAT DO YOU WANT?

432
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,691
I FIGURED OF ALL PEOPLE, YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND.

433
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,294
WHY ON EARTH WOULD I UNDERSTAND THIS?

434
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:39,198
YOU DIDN'T MARRY YOUR BARRY, HONEY

435
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,200
BUT I MARRIED MINE.

436
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,204
OH.

437
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,009
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE, WE'RE IN TROUBLE HERE.

438
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,011
WE'VE GOT 12 HOURS AND 36 MINUTES LEFT.

439
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,612
MOVE! MOVE! MOVE!

440
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:57,116
MONICA, I FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD HAVE GERMAN SUBTITLES.

441
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,719
JOEY, SPEED IT UP!

442
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,721
I'M SORRY. IT'S THE PIGS!

443
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,924
THEY'RE RELUCTANT TO GET IN THE BLANKETS.

444
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,426
MONICA, HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

445
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,428
I THOUGHT YOU HAD THIS ALL PLANNED OUT.

446
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,230
DO YOU WANT ME TO CRY?

447
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,232
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

448
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,835
DO YOU WANT TO SEE ME CRY?

449
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,437
SIR, NO, SIR!

450
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,741
ALL RIGHT, YOU.

451
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,343
WHAT? NO.

452
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,144
LOOK, I TOLD YOU.

453
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,146
I AM NOT A PART OF THIS THING.

454
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,347
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, ROSS.

455
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,150
I REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH CAROL AND SUSAN

456
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,952
AND I FEEL FOR YOU, I DO, BUT IF YOU DON'T HELP ME COOK

457
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,355
I'M GOING TO TAKE A BUNCH OF THOSE LITTLE HOT DOGS

458
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,158
AND CREATE A NEW APPETIZER CALLED "PIGS IN ROSS."

459
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,759
ALL RIGHT, BALL A MELON!

460
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,261
HEY, HOW COME I'M STUCK DICING

461
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,862
WHEN HE GETS TO BALL A MELON?

462
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,564

463
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:48,567
HI.

464
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,768
HI. HOW'S IT GOING?

465
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:52,171
OH, IT'S GOING GREAT, RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.

466
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,972
GOT MY LITTLE HAPPY HELPERS.

467
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,574

468
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,676
WELL, THAT'S FINE. WHATEVER.

469
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,678
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

470
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:00,879
NOTHING.

471
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,881
OKAY, EVERYTHING.

472
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,284
I THINK WE'RE CALLING OFF THE WEDDING.

473
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,485
WHAT?

474
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,487
YOU'RE STILL GOING TO PAY ME, RIGHT?

475
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,591
OR SOMETHING A LITTLE LESS SELFISH.

476
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,194
CAROL, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

477
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,395
WHAT HAPPENED?

478
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,596
MY PARENTS CALLED THIS AFTERNOON

479
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,797
TO SAY THEY WEREN'T COMING.

480
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:19,998
OH, MY GOD.

481
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,400
I MEAN, I KNEW THEY WERE HAVING TROUBLE

482
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,203
WITH THIS WHOLE THING BUT... BUT THEY'RE MY PARENTS.

483
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,605
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GIVE ME AWAY AND EVERYTHING.

484
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,806
OKAY. I'M SORRY.

485
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,908
THEN SUSAN AND I GOT IN THIS BIG FIGHT

486
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,711
BECAUSE I SAID MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL OFF THE WEDDING

487
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,114
AND THEN SHE SAID, "WE'RE NOT DOING THIS FOR THEM.

488
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,916
WE'RE DOING IT FOR US," AND IF I COULDN'T SEE THAT

489
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,319
THEN MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL OFF THE WEDDING.

490
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,321
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

491
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:45,124
I, UH, CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GOING TO SAY THIS

492
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,725
BUT I THINK SUSAN'S RIGHT.

493
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,427
YOU DO?

494
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,829
LOOK, DO YOU LOVE HER?

495
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,632
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE TOO EMPHATIC ABOUT THIS.

496
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,835
OF COURSE I DO.

497
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,036
WELL, THEN, THAT'S IT

498
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,439
AND IF GEORGE AND ADELAIDE CAN'T ACCEPT THAT

499
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,040
THEN THE HELL WITH THEM.

500
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,343
LOOK. I MEAN...

501
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:07,146
IF MY PARENTS DIDN'T WANT ME TO MARRY YOU

502
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,548
NO WAY THAT WOULD HAVE STOPPED ME.

503
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,751
LOOK... LOOK, THIS IS YOUR WEDDING.

504
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,853
DO IT.

505
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,457
YOU'RE RIGHT.

506
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,459
OF COURSE, YOU'RE RIGHT.

507
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,860
SO WE'RE BACK ON?

508
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,762
WE'RE BACK ON.

509
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,564
YOU HEARD THE WOMAN! PEEL! CHOP! DEVIL!

510
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,370
I CAN'T BELIEVE I LOST TWO MINUTES.

511
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,382
IT JUST SEEMS SO FUTILE, YOU KNOW?

512
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:46,185
ALL THESE WOMEN AND...

513
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,786
NOTHING.

514
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,991
I FEEL LIKE SUPERMAN WITHOUT MY POWERS, YOU KNOW?

515
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,593
I HAVE THE CAPE

516
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,396
AND YET I CANNOT FLY.

517
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:03,802
WELL, NOW YOU UNDERSTAND HOW I FEEL EVERY SINGLE DAY.

518
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:07,406
OKAY? THE WORLD IS MY LESBIAN WEDDING.

519
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:12,411

520
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,814

521
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,419
BUTTERSCOTCH?

522
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,421
NO ONE?

523
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:25,624
ALL RIGHT, YOU'LL BE SORRY LATER.

524
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,260
THANK YOU.

525
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,461
ANYTIME.

526
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:06,865
ROSS.

527
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,971
YOU KNOW...

528
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,774
NOTHING MAKES GOD HAPPIER THAN WHEN TWO PEOPLE--

529
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,776
ANY TWO PEOPLE-- COME TOGETHER IN LOVE.

530
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,679
FRIENDS, FAMILY, WE'RE GATHERED HERE TODAY

531
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,882
TO JOIN CAROL AND SUSAN IN HOLY MATRIMONY.

532
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:25,884
OH, MY GOD!

533
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,687
NOW, I'VE SEEN EVERYTHING.

534
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,291
WHOA! SHE'S GONE.

535
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,693
SHE'S GONE.

536
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:35,694
SHE'S GONE.

537
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,696
GO AHEAD. GET MARRIED.

538
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:38,897
GO. GO.

539
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:43,302
? STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT ?

540
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,505
? EXCHANGING GLANCES... ?

541
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,308
 WOULD YOU LOOK AT THEM?

542
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,511
YEAH. CAN'T HELP BUT.

543
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,417
HOW'S THAT PIG IN THE BLANKET

544
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,018
WORKING OUT FOR YOU?

545
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,221
I WRAPPED THOSE BAD BOYS.

546
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,425
I MISS ROSE.

547
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:07,626
OH, YEAH?

548
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:08,427
I KNOW IT'S KIND OF WEIRD

549
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,028
BUT SHE WAS A BIG PART

550
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:11,630
OF MY LIFE THERE

551
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,433
YOU KNOW, AND I JUST FEEL KIND OF ALONE.

552
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,535
YOU KNOW, I, UH...

553
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:20,138
COULDN'T HELP OVERHEARING WHAT YOU JUST SAID AND, UH...

554
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:23,342
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO FORGET ABOUT ROSE

555
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,344
MOVE ON WITH YOUR LIFE.

556
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,346
HOW ABOUT WE GO GET YOU A DRINK?

557
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,348
OKAY. THAT'S SO NICE.

558
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:37,255
I SHOULDN'T EVEN BOTHER

559
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,257
COMING UP WITH A LINE, RIGHT?

560
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,263
HEY, MOM, YOU HAVING FUN?

561
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,465
OH, AM I.

562
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:50,469
I JUST DANCED WITH A WONDERFULLY LARGE WOMAN

563
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,871
AND THREE OTHER GIRLS MADE EYES AT ME

564
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,072
OVER AT THE BUFFET.

565
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:57,275
OH, I'M NOT SAYING IT'S SOMETHING I WANT TO PURSUE

566
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,277
BUT IT'S NICE TO KNOW I HAVE OPTIONS.

567
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:01,279
UH HUH. THAT'S GOOD.

568
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,481

569
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,283
THERE'S MORE ALCOHOL, RIGHT?

570
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:10,889
HOW YOU DOING?

571
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,692
OKAY.

572
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,094
YOU DID A GOOD THING TODAY.

573
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,696
YEAH.

574
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,801
YOU WANT TO DANCE?

575
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,604
NO. THAT'S FINE.

576
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,105
COME ON.

577
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,908
I'LL LET YOU LEAD.

578
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,413
OKAY.

579
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,615
? EVER SINCE THAT NIGHT ?

580
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,617
? THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER ?

581
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,619
? LOVERS AT FIRST SIGHT ?

582
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:44,122
? IN LOVE FOREVER ?

583
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:47,325
? IT TURNED OUT SO RIGHT... ?

584
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:48,927
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

585
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,529
PENIS, SCHMEENIS, OKAY?

586
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,531
WE'RE ALL PEOPLE.

587
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,741
OKAY, WHICH ONE OF US, DO YOU THINK

588
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,544
IS GOING TO BE THE FIRST ONE TO GET MARRIED?

589
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,646
UH, MON, I WAS MARRIED.

590
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,247
YEAH, ME, TOO, TECHNICALLY.

591
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,449
I HAD A WEDDING.

592
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,251
ALL RIGHT, JUST TRYING TO START AN INTERESTING DISCUSSION.

593
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,753
 I GOT ONE.

594
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,556
WHICH ONE OF US WILL BE THE LAST TO GET MARRIED?

595
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,562
WHA...? ISN'T BEN IN THIS?
