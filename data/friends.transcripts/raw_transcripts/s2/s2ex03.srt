1
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:04,304
HEY.

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:05,905
HEY.

3
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:06,706
SO HOW WAS JOAN?

4
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:07,907
BROKE UP WITH HER.

5
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:09,509
OH... WHY?

6
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,710
DON'T TELL ME.

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,113
BECAUSE OF THE BIG NOSTRIL THING?

8
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:15,115
THEY WERE HUGE.

9
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:18,718
WHEN SHE SNEEZED, BATS FLEW OUT OF THEM.

10
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:19,819
OH, COME ON.

11
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:21,421
THEY WERE NOT THAT HUGE.

12
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,023
I'M TELLING YOU.

13
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,025
SHE LEANED BACK, I COULD SEE HER BRAIN.

14
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,926
HOW MANY PERFECTLY FINE WOMEN

15
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:28,228
ARE YOU GOING TO REJECT

16
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:31,431
OVER THE MOST SUPERFICIAL, INSIGNIFICANT THINGS?

17
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:32,632
HOLD IT, HOLD IT.

18
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:34,634
I MEAN, I GOT TO SIDE WITH CHANDLER ON THIS ONE.

19
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,636
WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO THE CITY

20
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,039
I WENT OUT A COUPLE TIMES WITH THIS GIRL--

21
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,240
REALLY HOT, GREAT KISSER--

22
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,242
BUT SHE HAD THE BIGGEST ADAM'S APPLE.

23
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,843
EWW!

24
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,145
DROVE ME NUTS.

25
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,547
YOU OR ME.

26
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,149
I GOT IT.

27
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,352
UH, JOEY, WOMEN DON'T HAVE ADAM'S APPLES.

28
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,959

29
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,462
YOU GUYS ARE MESSING WITH ME, RIGHT?

30
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,064
YEAH.

31
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,165
YEAH. WE ARE.

32
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,766
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.

33
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:11,971
FOR A SECOND THERE, I WAS LIKE, WHOA.

47
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,818
SO, YOU NAME ONE WOMAN

48
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:02,822
THAT YOU BROKE UP WITH FOR AN ACTUAL REAL REASON.

49
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,924
MAUREEN ROSILLO.

50
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,727
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T HATE YANNI IS NOT A REAL REASON.

51
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,130

52
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,232
OH...

53
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,435
HELLO, MR. HECKLES.

54
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,137
YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN.

55
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,538
WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING.

56
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:19,739
YOU'RE STOMPING.

57
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,741
IT'S DISTURBING MY BIRDS.

58
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,146
YOU DON'T HAVE BIRDS.

59
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,548
I COULD HAVE BIRDS.

60
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:31,451
OKAY, MR. HECKLES, WE'LL TRY TO KEEP IT DOWN.

61
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:32,752
THANK YOU.

62
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:35,155
I'M GOING TO REJOIN MY DINNER PARTY.

63
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,957
ALL RIGHT. BYE BYE.

64
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,959
 OKAY, JANICE.

65
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,362
JANICE. YOU GOT TO GIVE ME JANICE.

66
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,364
THAT WASN'T ABOUT BEING PICKY.

67
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,565
WE'LL GIVE YOU JANICE.

68
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,066
I MISS JANICE, THOUGH.

69
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:50,270
HELLO, CHANDLER BING.

70
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:55,975
OH... MY... GOD!

71
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,877
OH, CHANDLER...

72
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,079
NOW... NOW...

73
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,583
THAT'S IT.

74
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,485
THERE. FASTER.

75
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,587

76
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,293

77
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,695
STOP WITH THE BROOM!

78
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,297
WE'RE NOT MAKING NOISE!

79
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:19,699

80
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,504

81
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,908
WE WON.

82
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:29,709
WE DID?

83
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,311

84
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,213

85
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,615
MR. HECKLES...

86
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:40,620
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

87
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,222
HE MUST HAVE BEEN SWEEPING.

88
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,823
THEY FOUND A BROOM IN HIS HAND.

89
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,628
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

90
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,429
I KNOW.

91
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,331
I WAS SWEEPING YESTERDAY.

92
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,932
IT COULD HAVE BEEN ME.

93
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,133
 YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

94
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:55,335
 SURE, SURE.

95
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,737
SWEEPING-- YOU NEVER KNOW.

96
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,938
NEVER KNOW.

97
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,644
OKAY, IT'S VERY FAINT

98
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,847
BUT I CAN STILL SENSE HIM IN THE BUILDING.

99
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,050
GO INTO THE LIGHT, MR. HECKLES!

100
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,955
OKAY, PHOEBE.

101
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,958
I'M SORRY, BUT SOMETIMES THEY NEED HELP.

102
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,661
HERE WE GO.

103
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,663
THAT'S FINE. GO AHEAD AND SCOFF.

104
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,466
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS OUT THERE

105
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,667
THAT I DON'T BELIEVE IN

106
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,269
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE NOT TRUE.

107
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,870
SUCH AS?

108
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,874
LIKE CROP CIRCLES OR THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE

109
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,075
OR EVOLUTION.

110
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,977
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

111
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:42,482
WHAT, YOU DON'T, UH... YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN EVOLUTION?

112
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,683
NO. NOT REALLY.

113
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,987
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN EVOLUTION?

114
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:48,988
I DON'T KNOW.

115
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,791
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW-- MONKEYS, DARWIN--

116
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,393
YOU KNOW, IT'S A NICE STORY.

117
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,395
I JUST THINK IT'S A LITTLE TOO EASY.

118
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,200
TOO EASY? TOO...?

119
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,404
THE PROCESS OF EVERY LIVING THING ON THIS PLANET

120
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,406
EVOLVING OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS

121
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,009
FROM SINGLE CELLED ORGANISMS IS, IS TOO EASY?

122
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,912
YEAH. I JUST DON'T BUY IT.

123
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,414
UH, EXCUSE ME.

124
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,017
EVOLUTION IS NOT FOR YOU TO BUY, PHOEBE.

125
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,619
EVOLUTION IS SCIENTIFIC FACT

126
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,623
LIKE, LIKE, LIKE THE AIR WE BREATHE, LIKE GRAVITY.

127
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,326
OH. OKAY, DON'T GET ME STARTED ON GRAVITY.

128
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,232
YOU, UH...? YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN GRAVITY?

129
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,435
WELL, IT'S NOT SO MUCH

130
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,837
THAT, YOU KNOW, LIKE I DON'T BELIEVE IN IT.

131
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,038
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST...

132
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,040
I DON'T KNOW, LATELY I GET THE FEELING

133
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,642
THAT I'M NOT SO MUCH BEING PULLED DOWN

134
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,243
AS I AM BEING PUSHED.

135
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,045
PUSHED? PUSHED.

136
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,347

137
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,149
UH OH. IT'S ISAAC NEWTON AND HE'S PISSED.

138
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,454
QUICK, PHEEBS, UP ON THE CEILING.

139
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,757
OH, THERE SHE IS, RIGHT OVER THERE.

140
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:58,858
THAT'S THE OTHER ONE.

141
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,460
THIS IS MR. BUDDY BOYLE--

142
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,661
HECKLES' ATTORNEY.

143
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,162
HE'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU.

144
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:04,764
WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU?

145
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,665
ALL RIGHT, KIDS.

146
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,866
HERE'S THE DEAL--

147
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,868
ACCORDING TO MY CLIENT'S WILL

148
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,472
HE WANTS TO LEAVE ALL HIS EARTHLY POSSESSIONS

149
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:16,876
TO THE, UH, "NOISY GIRLS IN THE APARTMENT ABOVE MINE."

150
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,077
WHAT?

151
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,480
WELL, WHAT ABOUT HIS FAMILY?

152
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,681
HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY.

153
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,483
 WHOA.

154
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,686
OH... OKAY, SO LET'S TALK MONEY.

155
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:27,887
ALL RIGHT.

156
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,489
THERE WAS NONE.

157
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,491
NOW, LET'S TALK SIGNING.

158
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,092
YOU BE NOISY GIRL NUMBER ONE.

159
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,094
YOU BE NOISY GIRL NUMBER TWO.

160
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:39,098
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS WHOLE TIME WE THOUGHT HE HATED US.

161
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,700
I MEAN, ISN'T IT AMAZING

162
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,503
HOW MUCH YOU CAN TOUCH SOMEONE'S LIFE

163
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,505
WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT?

164
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,106
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS DUMP?

165
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,307
HE HATED US.

166
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,909
THIS WAS HIS FINAL REVENGE.

167
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,512
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN SO MUCH CRAP?

168
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:56,115
ACTUALLY, I THINK THIS APARTMENT SULLIES THE GOOD NAME OF CRAP.

169
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,818
CHECK THIS OUT.

170
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,422
COULD I HAVE THIS?

171
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:06,826
HOW CAN YOU NOT BELIEVE IN EVOLUTION?

172
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,128
I DON'T KNOW. JUST DON'T.

173
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,630
LOOK AT THIS FUNKY SHIRT.

174
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,632
LOOK, PHEEBS, I'VE STUDIED EVOLUTION

175
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,034
MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE, OKAY, AND I CAN TELL YOU

176
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,637
WE HAVE COLLECTED FOSSILS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD

177
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,238
THAT ACTUALLY SHOW

178
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:22,842
THE EVOLUTION OF DIFFERENT SPECIES, OKAY?

179
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:28,448
I MEAN, YOU CAN LITERALLY SEE THEM EVOLVING THROUGH TIME.

180
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:29,348
REALLY?

181
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,350
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT?

182
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,452
YOU BET.

183
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,055
IN... UH, IN THE U.S., CHINA, AFRICA, ALL OVER.

184
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,258
SEE, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

185
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,461
WELL, THERE YOU GO.

186
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,062
HUH.

187
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,364
SO NOW, THE REAL QUESTION IS

188
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:48,167
WHO PUT THOSE FOSSILS THERE, AND WHY?

189
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,072
HEY, LOOK AT THIS.

190
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:56,275
"MY BIG BOOK OF GRIEVANCES."

191
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,279
HEY, THERE'S ME.

192
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,883
"APRIL 17-- EXCESSIVE NOISE.

193
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,285
ITALIAN GUY COMES HOME WITH A DATE."

194
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,688
YEAH. HEY, CHANDLER, LOOK, YOU'RE IN HERE TOO.

195
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,690
"APRIL 18-- EXCESSIVE NOISE.

196
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,494
ITALIAN GUY'S GAY ROOMMATE BRINGS HOME DRY CLEANING."

197
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,904
WELL, THAT'S EXCELLENT.

198
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,706
MONICA... MONICA, LOOK AT THIS LAMP.

199
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,307
IS THIS TACKY OR WHAT?

200
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,509
WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS.

201
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,112
UH, RACH, I THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH REGULAR LAMPS.

202
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,313
WHAT? OH, COME ON.

203
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,915
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M ASKING

204
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,919
FOR THIS GIRLIE CLOCK OR ANYTHING, WHICH, BY THE WAY

205
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,921
I ALSO THINK IS REALLY COOL.

206
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,624
LOOK, IT DOESN'T GO WITH ANY OF MY STUFF.

207
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,225
WELL, WHAT ABOUT MY STUFF?

208
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,627
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY STUFF.

209
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,729
THIS WILL BE THE START OF MY STUFF.

210
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,731
MMM... NO.

211
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,934
YOU STILL THINK OF IT AS YOUR APARTMENT, DON'T YOU?

212
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,436
MMM... NO.

213
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,638
YES, YOU DO.

214
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,239
YOU THINK OF IT AS YOUR APARTMENT

215
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,542
AND I'M JUST SOMEONE WHO RENTS A ROOM.

216
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,743
MMM...

217
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,944
OKAY, WHILE YOU

218
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,546
"MMM..." ON THAT FOR A WHILE

219
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,147
I'M GOING TO GO FIND A PLACE

220
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,348
FOR MY NEW LAMP.

221
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,752
OKAY, PHEEBS

222
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:16,455
SEE HOW I'M MAKING THESE LITTLE TOYS MOVE?

223
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,459
OPPOSABLE THUMBS.

224
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,864
WITHOUT EVOLUTION, HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN

225
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,767
OPPOSABLE THUMBS?

226
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,769
MAYBE THE OVERLORDS NEEDED THEM

227
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,771
TO STEER THEIR SPACECRAFTS.

228
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,173
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE JOKING.

229
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,075
LOOK, CAN'T WE JUST SAY

230
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,078
THAT YOU BELIEVE IN SOMETHING AND I DON'T?

231
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:39,879
NO, NO.

232
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,681
NO, PHEEBS, WE CAN'T, OKAY?

233
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,282
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE MATH.

234
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:44,884
ONE PLUS ONE EQUALS TWO.

235
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,286
I CAN'T STAND BY AND LET YOU THINK

236
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,689
THAT ONE PLUS ONE MIGHT EQUAL THREE

237
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,290
OR FOUR OR YELLOW.

238
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,292
WHY NOT?

239
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,095
NO, WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

240
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,697
WHAT IS THIS OBSESSIVE NEED YOU HAVE

241
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,298
TO MAKE EVERYBODY AGREE WITH YOU?

242
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,500
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

243
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,502
I THINK MAYBE IT'S TIME

244
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,706
YOU PUT ROSS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE.

245
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,812
IS THERE BLOOD COMING OUT OF MY EARS?

246
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,315
CHECK IT OUT. CHECK IT OUT.

247
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,917
HECKLES' HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK.

248
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,118
LOOK.

249
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,920
WOW, HE LOOKS SO NORMAL.

250
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,521
HE'S EVEN KIND OF CUTE.

251
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:25,324
"HECKLES, YOU CRACK ME UP IN SCIENCE CLASS.

252
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,727
YOU'RE THE FUNNIEST KID IN SCHOOL."

253
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:28,928
FUNNIEST? HECKLES?

254
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,129
THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS.

255
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:34,934
WOW, HECKLES WAS VOTED CLASS CLOWN, AND SO WAS I.

256
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,235

257
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,036
HE WAS RIGHT.

258
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,638
WOULD YOU LISTEN TO THAT?

259
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,239
I'D CALL THAT EXCESSIVE.

260
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,440
WHOA.

261
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,642
WHAT?

262
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,444
HECKLES PLAYED CLARINET IN BAND, AND I PLAYED CLARINET.

263
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,245
AND HE WAS IN

264
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,847
THE SCALE MODELERS CLUB

265
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,650
AND I WAS... WELL, THERE WAS NO CLUB

266
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,452
BUT I SURE THOUGHT THEY WERE COOL.

267
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:56,555
SO, YOU WERE BOTH DORKS.

268
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:57,757
BIG DEAL.

269
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,259
I JUST THINK IT'S WEIRD, YOU KNOW-- HECKLES AND ME...

270
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,060

271
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,662
HECKLES AND ME, ME...

272
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,663

273
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,864
ME AND HECKLES...

274
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:08,467
HEY, WOULD YOU KNOCK IT OFF!

275
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,973

276
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,788
HAVE YOU BEEN HERE ALL NIGHT?

277
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:29,989
LOOK AT THIS.

278
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,590
PICTURES OF ALL THE WOMEN

279
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,192
THAT HECKLES WENT OUT WITH.

280
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,794
LOOK WHAT HE WROTE ON THEM.

281
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,796
"VIVIAN, TOO TALL."

282
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,198
"MADGE, BIG GUMS."

283
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,200
"TOO LOUD."

284
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,201
"TOO SMART."

285
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,803
"MAKES NOISE WHEN SHE EATS."

286
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,404
THIS IS... THIS IS ME.

287
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:48,407
THIS IS WHAT I DO.

288
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,610
I'M GOING TO END UP ALONE JUST LIKE HE DID.

289
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,512
CHANDLER, HECKLES WAS A NUT CASE.

290
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,915
OUR TRAINS ARE ON THE SAME TRACK, OKAY?

291
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,118
YEAH, SURE, I'M COMING UP 30 YEARS BEHIND HIM

292
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,520
BUT THE STOPS ARE ALL THE SAME:

293
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,423
BITTERTOWN, ALONEVILLE, HERMIT JUNCTION.

294
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,025
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT WE GOT TO DO?

295
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,027
WE GOT TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

296
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,029
COME ON, I'LL BUY YOU BREAKFAST. LET'S GO.

297
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,931
WELL, WHAT IF I NEVER FIND SOMEBODY?

298
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,933
OR EVEN WORSE, WHAT IF I ALREADY FOUND HER

299
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,736
BUT I DUMPED HER BECAUSE SHE PRONOUNCES IT "SUPPOSEBLY"?

300
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,437
CHANDLER, COME ON.

301
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,840
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND SOMEBODY.

302
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,641
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? HOW?

303
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:23,843
I DON'T KNOW.

304
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,245
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU OUT.

305
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,048
YOU'LL SEE. YOU GUYS ARE ALL GOING TO GO OFF AND GET MARRIED

306
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,649
AND I'M GOING TO END UP ALONE.

307
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,952
WILL YOU PROMISE ME SOMETHING?

308
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,855
WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED, WILL YOU INVITE ME OVER FOR HOLIDAYS?

309
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,758
WELL, I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING.

310
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,364
I MEAN, WHAT IF WE'RE OVER AT HER FOLKS' PLACE?

311
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,968
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

312
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,974
YOU CAN COME OVER AND WATCH THE SUPER BOWL.

313
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,976
EVERY YEAR. ALL RIGHT?

314
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,677
YOU KNOW WHAT?

315
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,881
I'M NOT GOING TO END UP LIKE THIS.

316
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,582
I'LL SEE YOU, MAN.

317
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,188
GEEZ.

318
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,794
SUPPOSEBLY...

319
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,798
SUPPOSEBLY.

320
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,602
"DID THEY GO TO THE ZOO?"

321
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:26,005
"SUPPOSEBLY."

322
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,417

323
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,220
HI. IT'S ME.

324
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,725
OH... MY... GOD.

325
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,128
JANICE? YOU CALLED JANICE?

326
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,931
YES, JANICE. WHY IS THAT

327
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,333
SO DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO COMPREHEND?

328
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,535
YOU REMEMBER JANICE, RIGHT?

329
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,237
YES.

330
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:02,641
SHE WAS SMART, SHE WAS PRETTY AND SHE HONESTLY CARED ABOUT ME.

331
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,444
JANICE IS MY LAST CHANCE TO HAVE SOMEBODY.

332
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:09,248
HELLO!

333
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,553
OH... MY... GOD.

334
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,157
GEEZ, LOOK HOW FAT SHE GOT.

335
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,361
HEY, IT'S EVERYBODY.

336
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,263
 HI, JANICE.

337
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,464
JANICE, YOU'RE...

338
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,666
YES, I AM.

339
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,868
IS IT...?

340
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,469
IS IT YOURS?

341
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,471
HAH! YOU WISH, CHANDLER BING.

342
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:37,076
YOU ARE LOOKING AT A MARRIED LADY NOW.

343
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,178
OH. YEAH.

344
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,582
CONGRATULATIONS.

345
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,584
OH, SWEETIE, I'M SORRY.

346
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,787
I COULDN'T WAIT FOR YOU FOREVER.

347
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,689
YOU COULDN'T HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS OVER THE PHONE?

348
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,391
AND WHAT?

349
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,194
MISS THE EXPRESSION ON YOUR FACE? OH, NO.

350
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,096
JANICE LIKES TO HAVE HER FUN.

351
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:01,800

352
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:11,410
HEY, RACH, YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVEN'T PLAYED IN A WHILE?

353
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,211
WHAT?

354
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:15,314
HIDE THE LAMP.

355
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,917
OKAY. MONICA, LET IT GO.

356
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,020
DID YOU KNOW I WAS ALLERGIC TO SHELLFISH?

357
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,422
WELL, THEN, YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO EAT

358
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,824
THE OTHER LAMPS.

359
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,029
UH OH. IT'S SCARY SCIENTIST MAN.

360
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,433
OKAY, PHOEBE, THIS IS IT.

361
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,035
IN THIS BRIEFCASE

362
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,437
I CARRY ACTUAL SCIENTIFIC FACTS...

363
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,740
A BRIEFCASE OF FACTS, IF YOU WILL.

364
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:48,747
SOME OF THESE FOSSILS ARE OVER 200 MILLION YEARS OLD.

365
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,750
LOOK, BEFORE YOU EVEN START, I'M NOT DENYING EVOLUTION.

366
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,553
I'M JUST SAYING THAT IT'S ONE OF THE POSSIBILITIES.

367
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,755
IT'S THE ONLY POSSIBILITY, PHOEBE.

368
00:15:56,755 --> 00:16:00,359
ROSS, COULD YOU JUST OPEN YOUR MIND LIKE, THIS MUCH?

369
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,760
NOW, WASN'T THERE A TIME

370
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,163
WHEN THE BRIGHTEST MINDS IN THE WORLD

371
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,165
BELIEVED THAT THE EARTH WAS FLAT?

372
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,167
AND UP UNTIL, LIKE 50 YEARS AGO

373
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:11,270
YOU ALL THOUGHT THE ATOM WAS THE SMALLEST THING

374
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,871
UNTIL YOU SPLIT IT OPEN

375
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,674
AND THIS LIKE, WHOLE MESS OF CRAP CAME OUT.

376
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,977
NOW, ARE YOU TELLING ME

377
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,779
THAT YOU ARE SO UNBELIEVABLY ARROGANT

378
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,781
THAT YOU CAN'T ADMIT

379
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,985
THAT THERE'S A TEENY, TINY POSSIBILITY

380
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,387
THAT YOU COULD BE WRONG ABOUT THIS?

381
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,097
THERE MIGHT BE...

382
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,899
A TEENY...

383
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:44,103
TINY...

384
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,105
POSSIBILITY.

385
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,509
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU CAVED.

386
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,611
WHAT?

387
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,014
YOU JUST ABANDONED YOUR WHOLE BELIEF SYSTEM.

388
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,418
BEFORE, I DIDN'T AGREE WITH YOU

389
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,020
BUT AT LEAST I RESPECTED YOU.

390
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,921
BUT...

391
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,623
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GO INTO WORK TOMORROW?

392
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,225
HOW...?

393
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,627
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FACE THE OTHER SCIENCE GUYS?

394
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,629
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FACE YOURSELF?

395
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:11,430
OH!

396
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,547
THAT WAS FUN.

397
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,149
SO WHO'S HUNGRY?

398
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,550
I AM.

399
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,952
ME, TOO. LET ME JUST GET MY COAT.

400
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,561
OH!

401
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,662
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

402
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,465
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, I SWEAR. ALL RIGHT?

403
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,867
I WAS PUTTING ON MY JACKET AND THE THING...

404
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,469
AND THE LAMP AND IT BROKE.

405
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,071
OH, PLEASE, MONICA.

406
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,073
YOU'VE ALWAYS HATED MY LAMP.

407
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,075
AND NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN

408
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,477
IT'S JUST, MAGICALLY, IT'S JUST BROKEN?

409
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,079
PHOEBE, TELL HER.

410
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,182
OKAY, I DIDN'T SEE IT BECAUSE I WAS PUTTING ON MY JACKET

411
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,184
BUT, UM, I WANT TO BELIEVE YOU.

412
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,989
HEY, CHANDLER.

413
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,792
MONICA JUST BROKE MY SEASHELL LAMP.

414
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:17,796
NEAT. I'M GOING TO DIE ALONE.

415
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:20,599
OKAY, YOU WIN.

416
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,304
CHANDLER, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DIE ALONE.

417
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,306
JANICE WAS MY SAFETY NET, OKAY?

418
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,708
AND NOW I HAVE TO GET A SNAKE.

419
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,411
UH HUH. WHY IS THAT?

420
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:36,014
IF I'M GOING TO BE AN OLD, LONELY MAN, I'M GOING TO NEED

421
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,716
A THING, YOU KNOW? A HOOK.

422
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,519
LIKE THAT GUY IN THE SUBWAY WHO EATS HIS OWN FACE.

423
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,620
SO I FIGURE

424
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,423
I'LL BE CRAZY MAN WITH A SNAKE, YOU KNOW?

425
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,624
CRAZY SNAKE MAN.

426
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,227
THEN I'LL GET MORE SNAKES, CALL THEM MY BABIES.

427
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,629
KIDS WON'T WALK PAST MY PLACE, THEY WILL RUN.

428
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,631
"RUN AWAY FROM CRAZY SNAKE MAN!"

429
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,233
THEY'LL SHOUT.

430
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,537
YOU'VE GOT TO GET OVER THIS, OKAY?

431
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,740
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO END UP ALONE.

432
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,542
OF COURSE I AM.

433
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,544
I REJECT ANYONE WHO'S CRAZY ENOUGH

434
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,146
TO ACTUALLY GO OUT WITH ME

435
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,948
AND THEN I BITCH ABOUT THE FACT

436
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:13,152
THAT THERE AREN'T ANY GREAT WOMEN OUT THERE.

437
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,654
CHANDLER, YOU HAVE JUST DESCRIBED

438
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,857
VIRTUALLY EVERY MAN THAT WE HAVE EVER GONE OUT WITH.

439
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,559
YEAH.

440
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,760
YOU ARE NOT A FREAK.

441
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,961
YOU'RE A GUY.

442
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,563
 YEAH, HONEY, SHE'S RIGHT.

443
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,265
I MEAN, YOU ALL DO IT.

444
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,667
THIS ONE GUY STOPPED SEEING ME

445
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,870
BECAUSE... BECAUSE HIS CAT DIDN'T LIKE ME.

446
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,071
OR THIS GUY DUMPED ME

447
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,073
BECAUSE I FELL ASLEEP DURING SPINAL TAP.

448
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,875
YOU FELL ASLEEP DURING SPINAL TAP?

449
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,977
OH! OH! THAT TEDDY

450
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,179
WHAT'S HIS NAME IN HIGH SCHOOL

451
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,981
WHO STOPPED SEEING YOU BECAUSE HE THOUGHT YOU WERE TOO FAT.

452
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,284
HE TOLD ME IT WAS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T

453
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,686
HAVE TIME FOR ME BECAUSE OF THE PLAY.

454
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,889
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

455
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,991
ANYWAY, MY POINT BEING YOU ARE NO DIFFERENT

456
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,593
THAN THE REST OF THEM.

457
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,195
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

458
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,396
YES, HE IS.

459
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,997
YEAH. YOU ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

460
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,199
IN A BAD WAY?

461
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,201
NO, HONEY, IN A WONDERFUL WAY.

462
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,203
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT NOW.

463
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,804
MOST GUYS DON'T EVEN HAVE A CLUE.

464
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,406
YOU ARE READY TO TAKE RISKS

465
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,607
YOU ARE READY TO BE VULNERABLE

466
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,209
AND INTIMATE WITH SOMEONE.

467
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,411
YEAH. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO END UP ALONE.

468
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,012
CHANDLER, YOU CALLED JANICE.

469
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,415
THAT'S HOW MUCH YOU WANTED TO BE

470
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,616
WITH SOMEONE.

471
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:20,819
YOU'VE MADE IT.

472
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,421
YOU'RE THERE.

473
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,423
YOU ARE READY TO MAKE A COMMITMENT.

474
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:27,626
WHOA! DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

475
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,634
OH, WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

476
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:39,037
SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S NOT YOURS THAT YOU CAN BREAK?

477
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,639
NO. UM...

478
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,842
I KNOW YOU LIKE THIS, AND I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

479
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:47,045
I THINK IT WOULD LOOK GOOD IN OUR APARTMENT.

480
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:50,549
THANK YOU.

481
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,352

482
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,656
THAT'S FINE.

483
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:00,959
HEY! WELL, YOU WILL ALL BE PLEASED TO KNOW

484
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,362
THAT I HAVE A DATE TOMORROW NIGHT.

485
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,764
THIS WOMAN ALISON FROM WORK--

486
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,065
SHE IS GREAT.

487
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,868
SHE'S PRETTY, SHE'S SMART, AND UH...

488
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,671
I'VE BEEN HOLDING OFF ASKING HER OUT IN THE PAST

489
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,273
BECAUSE SHE HAS A, UH...

490
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,275
UNUSUALLY LARGE HEAD

491
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,876
BUT I'M NOT GOING

492
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:21,280
TO LET THAT STUFF HANG ME UP ANYMORE.

493
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,981
LOOK AT ME. I'M GROWING.

494
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,185
HEY, YOU CAN'T RECYCLE YEARBOOKS, CAN YOU?

495
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,387
I'LL TAKE THAT.

496
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,988
YOU WANT HIS YEARBOOK?

497
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,189
YEAH, YEAH.

498
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,592
SOME PEOPLE SAID SOME NICE THINGS ABOUT HIM.

499
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,193
I THINK SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE IT.

500
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,195
GOSH, THIS IS SO WEIRD.

501
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,998
I MEAN, HIS WHOLE LIFE WAS IN THIS APARTMENT

502
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,600
AND NOW IT'S GONE.

503
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,402
YOU KNOW, I THINK

504
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:46,204
IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE JUST TOOK A FEW MOMENTS

505
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:47,906
FOR MR. HECKLES.

506
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:50,008
I MEAN, HE WAS KIND OF A PAIN-- HE WAS--

507
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,010
BUT HE WAS A PERSON.

508
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,713
 WHAT?

509
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,519
YOU'RE ALL GOING TO HELL.

510
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,721
OH, IT'S REALLY NOT THAT BIG.

511
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,725
TAKING THAT WITH YOU, HUH?

512
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,327
OH, YEAH.

513
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,934
HEY, YOU COMING?

514
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,936
YEAH. IN A SECOND.

515
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,554
GOOD BYE, MR. HECKLES.

516
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,759
WE'LL TRY TO KEEP IT DOWN.

518
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,572
OH, MY MAJOR WAS TOTALLY USELESS.

519
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,974
I MEAN, HOW OFTEN DO YOU LOOK IN THE CLASSIFIEDS

520
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,576
AND SEE "PHILOSOPHER WANTED"?

521
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,177
MMM... SURE.

522
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,580
MY GOD, THAT'S A BIG HEAD.

523
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,783
IT DIDN'T LOOK THIS BIG IN THE OFFICE.

524
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,785
MAYBE IT'S THE LIGHTING.

525
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:10,389
MY HEAD MUST LOOK LIKE A GOLF BALL AT WORK.

526
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,592
ALL RIGHT, DON'T GET HUNG UP ON IT.

527
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:14,793
QUICK, QUICK.

528
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,795
LIST FIVE THINGS YOU LIKE ABOUT HER.

529
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,397
NICE SMILE, GOOD DRESSER

530
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,999
BIG HEAD, BIG HEAD, BIG HEAD!
