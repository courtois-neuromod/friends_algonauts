00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:00,800

2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,005
ROSS KISSED ME.

3
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:05,905
NO!

4
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,708
OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD!

5
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,310
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,412
OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD!

7
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:13,613
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

8
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:14,914
WE WANT TO HEAR EVERYTHING.

9
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:17,717
MONICA, GET THE WINE AND UNPLUG THE PHONE.

10
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:20,120
RACHEL, DOES THIS END WELL

11
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,421
OR DO WE NEED TO GET TISSUES?

12
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,224
OH, IT ENDED VERY WELL.

13
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:25,125
OH...

14
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,426
DO NOT START WITHOUT ME.

15
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,028
DO NOT START WITHOUT ME!

16
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,229
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

17
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,830
LET'S HEAR ABOUT THE KISS.

18
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,633
WAS IT LIKE, WAS IT LIKE A SOFT BRUSH AGAINST YOUR LIPS

19
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,235
OR WAS IT LIKE A, YOU KNOW

20
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,237
"I GOT TO HAVE YOU NOW" KIND OF THING?

21
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,840
WELL, AT FIRST, IT WAS REALLY INTENSE, YOU KNOW

22
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,442
AND THEN... OH, GOD.

23
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,645
AND THEN WE JUST SORT OF SUNK INTO IT.

24
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,447
SO, OKAY, WAS HE HOLDING YOU

25
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,449
OR WAS HIS HANDS, LIKE, ON YOUR BACK?

26
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:50,650
NO, ACTUALLY, FIRST

27
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,152
THEY STARTED ON MY WAIST

28
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:55,755
AND THEN, THEY SLID UP, AND THEN, THEY WERE IN MY HAIR.

29
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,257
OH.

30
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:01,261
AND, UH... AND THEN I KISSED HER.

31
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,462
TONGUE?

32
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,064
YEAH.

33
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,066
COOL.

47
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,813
ALL RIGHT, CHECK OUT THIS BAD BOY.

48
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:56,716
12 MEGABYTES OF RAM.

49
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,318
500 MEGABYTE HARD DRIVE.

50
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,320
BUILT IN SPREADSHEET CAPABILITIES

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,823
AND A MODEM THAT TRANSMITS AT OVER 28,000 B.P.S.

52
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,425
WOW. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO USE IT FOR?

53
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,228
GAMES AND STUFF.

54
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,930
THERE ARE NO JOBS.

55
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,632
THERE ARE NO JOBS FOR ME.

56
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,833
WAIT, HERE'S ONE.

57
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:17,036
UH... WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO COOK NAKED?

58
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,439
THERE'S AN AD FOR A NAKED CHEF?

59
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,841
NO, BUT IF YOU'RE WILLING TO COOK NAKED

60
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,644
THEN YOU MIGHT BE WILLING TO DANCE NAKED

61
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,447
AND THEN...

62
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,648
HI.

63
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,150
HEY. OH, SO, UH...

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,152
HOW'D YOU MAKE OUT LAST NIGHT?

65
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:36,956
THAT THAT IS FUNNY.

66
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,558
THAT IS PAINFULLY FUNNY.

67
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,759
NO, WAIT. WAIT.

68
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,061
YEAH, THAT'S JUST PAINFUL.

69
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,263
WAIT A MINUTE.

70
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,065
I THOUGHT LAST NIGHT WAS GREAT.

71
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,066
YEAH, IT WAS, BUT...

72
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,268
I GET HOME, OKAY?

73
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,270

74
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,471

75
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,972
AND I'M THINKING TO MYSELF

76
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,374
"OH, MY GOD, WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING?"

77
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,177
HERE I AM, I'M WITH JULIE, THIS INCREDIBLE, GREAT WOMAN

78
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,179
WHO I CARE ABOUT, AND WHO CARES ABOUT ME

79
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,181
AND I'M, LIKE, "WHAT, AM I JUST GOING

80
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,782
TO THROW ALL THAT AWAY?"

81
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,385
YOU GOT ALL THAT FROM SALINE SOLUTION?

82
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,787
I'M THE SAME WAY.

83
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,389

SO, UM...

117
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:16,356
THIS IS A SONG, UM... ABOUT A LOVE TRIANGLE

118
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,758
BETWEEN THREE PEOPLE THAT I MADE UP.

119
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,665
UM... IT'S CALLED "TWO OF THEM KISSED LAST NIGHT."

120
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,669
? THERE WAS A GIRL ?

121
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,472
? WE'LL CALL HER BETTY ?

122
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:36,075
? AND A GUY, LET'S CALL HIM NEAL ?

123
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,077
? NOW... ?

124
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,880
? I CAN'T STRESS THIS POINT TOO STRONGLY ?

125
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,683
? THIS STORY ISN'T REAL... ?

126
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,488
? NOW OUR NEAL MUST DECIDE ?

127
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,291
? WHO WILL BE THE GIRL THAT HE CASTS ASIDE ?

128
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,693
? WILL BETTY BE THE ONE WHO HE LOVES TRULY ?

129
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,896
? OR WILL IT BE THE ONE WHO WE'LL CALL... LOOLIE? ?

130
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,901
? HE MUST DECIDE ?

131
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,102
? HE MUST DECIDE ?

132
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,504
? EVEN THOUGH I MADE HIM UP ?

133
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:08,107
? HE MUST DECIDE... ?

134
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:13,313
WELL, THIS IS A NICE RESUME.

135
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,315
NICE, NICE, NICE.

136
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,217
MUY IMPRESSIVO.

137
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,419
SHAME NONE OF IT'S TRUE.

138
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,822
I'M KIDDING. I'M KIDDING.

139
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,824
NO, IT'S ALL TRUE.

140
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,627
JUST A LITTLE NERVOUS, THAT'S ALL.

141
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,228
I'M FINE NOW.

142
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:32,031
SO, MR. RASTATTER, WHAT EXACTLY DOES THIS JOB ENTAIL?

143
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,633
THE AD WASN'T TOO CLEAR.

144
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,435
MOCKOLATE.

145
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,836
I'M SORRY?

146
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,037
MOCKOLATE.

147
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,440
IT'S A COMPLETELY SYNTHETIC CHOCOLATE SUBSTITUTE.

148
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,442
OOH!

149
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,043
WELL, GO AHEAD.

150
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,244
TRY A PIECE.

151
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,448
YEAH, WE THINK MOCKOLATE IS EVEN BETTER THAN CHOCOLATE.

152
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,149
ALL RIGHT.

153
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,956
MMM MMM.

154
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,758
YEAH?

155
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,460
I LOVE HOW IT CRUMBLES.

156
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,862
NOW, SEE, YOUR CHOCOLATE DOESN'T DO THAT.

157
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,063
NO, MA'AM.

158
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,665
WELL, ANYHOO

159
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,568
WE SHOULD BE GETTING OUR F.D.A. APPROVAL ANY DAY NOW.

160
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,870
HOPEFULLY, IN TIME FOR THANKSGIVING.

161
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,374
SEE, THE WAY WE LOOK AT IT, CHOCOLATE ALREADY DOMINATES

162
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,776
MOST OF YOUR MAJOR FOOD PREPARATION HOLIDAYS--

163
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,778
EASTER, CHRISTMAS, WHAT HAVE YOU.

167
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,187
WOW.

169
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,892
JUST WAITING FOR IT TO STOP BUBBLING.

170
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,293
YEAH.

171
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,495

00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,897

179
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,308

00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,522

00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,440

00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,446
WHY DIDN'T HE CALL?

199
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,848
HE'S GOING TO STAY WITH JULIE, ISN'T HE?

200
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:32,051
HE'S GOING TO STAY WITH HER AND SHE'S GOING TO BE ALL

201
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,252
"HI. I'M JULIE.

202
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:34,454
"ROSS PICKED ME

203
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,856
"AND WE'RE GOING TO GET MARRIED

204
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:40,059
AND HAVE LOTS OF KIDS, AND DIG UP STUFF TOGETHER."

205
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,862
NO OFFENSE, BUT THAT SOUNDS NOTHING LIKE HER.

206
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,166
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO

207
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,367
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

208
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,969
I MEAN, THIS IS, LIKE, A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE.

209
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,371
OH, I KNOW, THIS MUST BE SO HARD.

210
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,373
"OH, NO. TWO WOMEN LOVE ME.

211
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,375
"THEY'RE BOTH GORGEOUS AND SEXY.

212
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,578
"MY WALLET'S TOO SMALL FOR MY 50s

213
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,580
AND MY DIAMOND SHOES ARE TOO TIGHT."

214
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,483
HEY, HERE'S A THOUGHT, ROSS.

215
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,084
DON'T TOUCH THE COMPUTER.

216
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,086
DON'T EVER TOUCH THE COMPUTER.

217
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,988
ROSS, LISTEN.

218
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,090
I GOT TWO WORDS FOR YOU.

219
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,092
THREESOME.

220
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:19,398
YOU STILL HAVE ANOTHER WORD

221
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:22,201
IF YOU WANT TO USE IT.

222
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,203
OH, HEY, I... I THINK I KNOW WHAT IT IS-- "HELP."

223
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,805
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

224
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,507
LOOK, LET'S GET LOGICAL ABOUT THIS. OKAY?

225
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,108
WE'LL MAKE A LIST--

226
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,710
RACHEL AND JULIE, PROS AND CONS.

227
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,311
OH!

228
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,513
OH.

229
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,315
WE'LL PUT THEIR NAMES IN BOLD

230
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:37,917
WITH DIFFERENT FONTS

231
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,720
AND I CAN USE DIFFERENT COLORS FOR EACH COLUMN.

232
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,221
CAN'T WE JUST USE A PEN?

233
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,423
NO, AMISH BOY.

234
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,826
ALL RIGHT, LET'S, UH...

235
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,529
LET'S START WITH THE CONS, BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE FUN.

236
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,130
RACHEL FIRST.

237
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,332
I DON'T KNOW.

238
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,534
I MEAN...

239
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,737
ALL RIGHT, I GUESS YOU CAN SAY SHE'S...

240
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,739
SHE'S A LITTLE SPOILED SOMETIMES.

241
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,542
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

242
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,544
I GUESS, YOU KNOW

243
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,145
SOMETIMES, SHE'S A LITTLE DITZY

244
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:11,150
AND I'VE SEEN HER BE A LITTLE TOO INTO HER LOOKS.

245
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,353
OH, AND LIKE, JULIE AND I, WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON

246
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:17,156
BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH PALEONTOLOGISTS, RIGHT?

247
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,158
BUT RACHEL'S JUST A WAITRESS.

248
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,760
WAITRESS.

249
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,162
GOT IT. YOU GUYS WANT TO PLAY DOOM?

250
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:27,266
OR WE COULD KEEP DOING THIS.

251
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,070
WHAT ELSE?

252
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,472
I DON'T KNOW.

253
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,674
UH...

254
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,476
OH, HER ANKLES ARE A LITTLE CHUBBY.

255
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,377

256
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,579
OKAY.

257
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,379
LET'S DO JULIE.

258
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,981
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

259
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,086
SHE'S NOT RACHEL.

260
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:50,690
OKAY, THIS IS PUMPKIN PIE

261
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,692
WITH A MOCKOLATE COOKIE CRUMB CRUST.

262
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:56,295
THIS IS MOCKOLATE CRANBERRY CAKE, AND THESE ARE

263
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:59,098
MOCKOLATE CHIP COOKIES, JUST LIKE

264
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,700
THE INDIANS SERVED.

265
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,302
OH, MY GOD!

266
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,704
"OH, MY GOD" GOOD?

267
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,607
OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU LET ME PUT THIS

268
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,507
IN MY MOUTH.

269
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,009
OH! OH! SWEET LORD!

270
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,212
THIS IS WHAT EVIL MUST TASTE LIKE.

271
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:21,020
I'M TELLING YOU, THIS THING WON'T PRINT.

272
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,023
YES, I PRESSED THAT BUTTON, LIKE, A HUNDRED TIMES.

273
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:27,226
YOU KNOW, FOR A HOT LINE, YOU'RE NOT SO HOT.

274
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,328
WHAT...

275
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,330
WHAT IS THAT IN THE BACKGROUND?

276
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,932
ARE YOU WATCHING STAR TREK?!

277
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:38,738
HEY.

278
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,339
SO HOW'D IT GO WITH JULIE?

279
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,742
DID YOU-- DID YOU BREAK HER HEART?

280
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:43,643
YES.

281
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,244
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

282
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,445
SHE CRIED, I CRIED.

283
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,447
SHE THREW THINGS, THEY HIT ME.

284
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,649
HMM.

285
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,850
ANYWAY...

286
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,652
I DID THE RIGHT THING.

287
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,454
SO, SPOCK ACTUALLY HUGS HIS FATHER?

288
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,558
HEY, DO YOU GUYS HAVE...?

289
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,460
HI.

290
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,062
HI.

291
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,664
WHERE YOU GOING?

292
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,166
I, UH, I JUST GOT BACK

293
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,869
FROM, UH... FROM JULIE'S.

294
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,470
OH.

295
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,373
NO, NO, UH... IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

296
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,176
IT'S... UM, IT'S THE OTHER THING.

297
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,984
WELL... WHAT'S THE OTHER THING?

298
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,486
WHAT DO I THINK?

299
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,690
WELL, UH...

300
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,291
HE BROKE UP WITH JULIE.

301
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:37,096
WELL, GO HUG HER, FOR GOD SAKES.

302
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,498
REALLY?

303
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:40,700
REALLY.

304
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,602
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN YOU, RACH.

305
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,604
OH, GOD...

306
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,311
OH... OH...

307
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,315
OH...

308
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,518
OH, THIS IS GOOD, THIS IS REALLY GOOD.

309
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,120
I KNOW, I KNOW.

310
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,923
IT'S... IT'S ALMOST...

311
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:12,331
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO TAKE A WALK-- JUST US, NOT THEM?

312
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:15,134
OKAY. LET ME GET MY COAT.

313
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,536
NO-- HEY! I'LL GET YOUR COAT.

314
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,138
OKAY.

315
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,645
HE'S GOING TO GET MY COAT.

316
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,247
HE'S GOING TO GET MY COAT!

317
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,649
OH, MY GOD, YOU GUYS, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

318
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,251
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!

319
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,452
WHAT'S THAT?

320
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,653
WHAT?! NOTHING!

321
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,456
WHAT IS THAT?

322
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,458
I SAW MY NAME. WHAT IS IT?

323
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,060
NO, NO. SEE? SEE?

324
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:41,961
HEY, IT'S PRINTING.

325
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,263
HEY, IT'S PRINTING!

326
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,165
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

327
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,366
LET ME SEE.

328
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,368
HEY, SOMEONE ORDER A COAT?

329
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:50,569
CHANDLER WROTE SOMETHING

330
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:51,771
ABOUT ME ON HIS COMPUTER

331
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,372
AND HE WON'T LET ME SEE.

332
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,274
HE WON'T... HE WON'T?

333
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,876
HE...

334
00:12:56,876 --> 00:13:00,980
BECAUSE ISN'T THAT, ISN'T THAT THE... THE SHORT STORY

335
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,181
YOU WERE WRITING?

336
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,583
YES, YES, IT IS THE SHORT STORY...

337
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,785
THAT I WAS WRITING.

338
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,087
AND I'M IN IT? WELL, LET ME READ IT!

339
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,289
NO. NO. NO.

340
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,490
COME ON!

341
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,094
HEY, UH, WHY DON'T YOU READ IT TO HER?

342
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:27,006
ALL RIGHT.

343
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,517
"IT WAS SUMMER...

344
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,720
"AND IT WAS HOT.

345
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,722
RACHEL WAS THERE."

346
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:44,523
HUH?

347
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,529
"A LONELY GRAY COUCH.

348
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,332
"'OH, LOOK,' CRIED NED.

349
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:57,736
AND THEN THE KINGDOM WAS HIS FOREVER. THE END."

350
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,540
THAT'S IT? THAT'S ALL YOU WROTE?

351
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,844
YOU'RE THE WORST WRITER IN THE WHOLE WORLD!

352
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,345
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

353
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,546
THIS ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE.

354
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:10,649
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT ME ON THAT PIECE OF PAPER

355
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,651
AND I WANT TO SEE IT.

356
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,453
NO, YOU DON'T.

357
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,055
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT? FINE.

358
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,057
IF YOU GUYS WANT TO BE CHILDREN

359
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,758
ABOUT THIS, THAT'S FINE.

360
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,161
I DO NOT NEED... TO SEE IT!

361
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:22,962

362
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,163
GO, GO, GO!

363
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,264
OOH!

364
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,068
WHAT IS THIS?

365
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:29,869
THAT IS...

366
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,070
THAT'S, THAT'S...

367
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,071
UH...

368
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,272
ROSS, WHAT IS THIS?

369
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,073
THANK YOU.

370
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,274
GOOD LUCK.

371
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:41,680
OKAY... JUST REMEMBER HOW CRAZY I AM ABOUT YOU, OKAY?

372
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,182
"KIND OF DITZY"?

373
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,284
"TOO INTO HER LOOKS"?

374
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,686
"SPOILED"?

375
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,688
NOW, THAT'S "A LITTLE SPOILED."

376
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,091
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO TYPE "LITTLE", THE IDIOT.

377
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,894
"JUST A WAITRESS"?

378
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,097
NOW, THAT... THAT WAS, UH...

379
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,499
I MEAN, AS OPPOSED TO, UH...

380
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,101
THE, UH...

381
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,302
OKAY, IS THIS OVER YET?

382
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,603
RACH?

383
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:09,308
OH! I DO NOT HAVE CHUBBY ANKLES.

384
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,009
NO, I...

385
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,210
NO, NO, RACH!

386
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,212
OKAY, LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE.

387
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,413
LOOK AT JULIE'S COLUMN.

388
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,814
"SHE'S NOT RACHEM"?

389
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,116
NO...

390
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,118
WHAT THE HELL'S A RACHEM?

391
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,921
IS THAT SOME STUPID PALEONTOLOGY WORD THAT I WOULDN'T KNOW

392
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,622
BECAUSE I'M JUST A WAITRESS?

393
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,624
RACH, COME ON! RACH...

394
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,626
RACH! RACH! NO, NO, NO!

395
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,029
IT'S "SHE'S NOT RACHEL."

396
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,630
SHE'S... SHE'S NOT...

397
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,632
RA...

398
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,234
RACHEL?

399
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,839
MY DIARY... MY DIARY-- THAT'S BRILLIANT!

400
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,242
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD HER IT WAS MY DIARY!

401
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,644
SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE MADE ME READ HER MY DIARY!

402
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:46,845
NO, THAT'S TRUE.

403
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,648
YOU'D BE A GREAT PERSON TO HAVE AROUND

404
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,650
THE DAY AFTER AN EMERGENCY.

405
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,853
I CANNOT BELIEVE ROSS EVEN MADE THIS LIST.

406
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:55,654
I KNOW.

407
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,256
WHAT A DINKUS.

408
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,857
HEY, CUT HIM SOME SLACK.

409
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,859
IT WAS CHANDLER'S IDEA.

410
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,161
WHAT?! WHAT?!

411
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,964
OH, GOOD, I WAS HOPING THAT WOULD COME UP.

412
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,565
THIS WAS YOUR IDEA?

413
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:07,766
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

414
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,970
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET SOME PERSPECTIVE HERE, OKAY?

415
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,772
THESE THINGS, THEY HAPPEN FOR A REASON.

416
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:14,974
YEAH-- YOU!

417
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,376
ALL RIGHT, PHEEBS, BACK ME UP HERE, OKAY?

418
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,778
YOU BELIEVE IN THAT KARMA CRAP, DON'T YOU?

419
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,083
YEAH. LISTEN, BY THE WAY, GOOD LUCK IN YOUR NEXT LIFE

420
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,784
AS A DUNG BEETLE.

421
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,595

422
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,202
RACH-- WHOOPS!

423
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,107
HEY! OPEN UP! PLEASE?

424
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:51,710
WHEN SOMEBODY DOES NOT BUZZ YOU IN, ROSS, THAT MEANS "GO AWAY."

425
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,913
THAT DOESN'T MEAN "PLEASE CLIMB UP THE FIRE ESCAPE."

426
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,215
I JUST WANT TO READ YOU SOMETHING.

427
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,416
IT'S YOUR "PRO" LIST.

428
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,418
NOT INTERESTED.

429
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,020
OKAY. "NUMBER ONE:

430
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,623
"THE WAY YOU CRY AT GAME SHOWS.

431
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,726
"NUMBER TWO: HOW MUCH YOU LOVE YOUR FRIENDS.

432
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,529
"NUMBER THREE: THE WAY YOU PLAY WITH YOUR HAIR

433
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,730
"WHEN YOU'RE NERVOUS.

434
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,533
"NUMBER FOUR: HOW BRAVE YOU ARE

435
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,535
"FOR STARTING YOUR LIFE OVER.

436
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:20,539
"NUMBER FIVE" HOW GREAT YOU ARE WITH BEN.

437
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,141
"NUMBER SIX

438
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,742
THE WAY YOU SMELL."

439
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,545
HEY, ROSS.

440
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,647
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

441
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,150
HEY, JOEY, YOU WANT TO OPEN THE WINDOW?

442
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,551
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT THERE?

443
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,752
I... I'M, UM...

444
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,354
OH, MY GOSH, YOU MUST BE FREEZING!

445
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,555
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?

446
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:40,359
HOW ABOUT A NICE, STEAMING CUP OF HOT MOCKOLATE?

447
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,264
RACH, COME ON, OPEN UP.

448
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,865
RACH, COME ON.

449
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,568
YOU GOT TO GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE.

450
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,769
NO.

451
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:51,970
NO?

452
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,172
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

453
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,174
LOOK, MAYBE WE SHOULD GO.

454
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,475
NO, YOU GUYS REALLY DON'T HAVE TO GO.

455
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,276
WE'RE DONE TALKING.

456
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,278
RACH, COME ON. LOOK, I KNOW HOW YOU MUST...

457
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,879
NO, YOU DON'T, ROSS.

458
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,081
IMAGINE

459
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,284
THE WORST THINGS YOU'D THINK ABOUT YOURSELF.

460
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,286
NOW, HOW WOULD YOU FEEL

461
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,489
IF THE ONE PERSON THAT YOU TRUSTED THE MOST IN THE WORLD

462
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,491
NOT ONLY THINKS THEM, TOO

463
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:16,095
BUT ACTUALLY USES THEM AS REASONS NOT TO BE WITH YOU.

464
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,496
NO, BUT, BUT...

465
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,699
SEE, I WANT TO BE WITH YOU IN SPITE OF ALL THOSE THINGS.

466
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,301
OH! WELL, THAT'S...

467
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,203
THAT'S MIGHTY BIG OF YOU, ROSS.

468
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,304
I SAID, DON'T GO!

469
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,608
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT?

470
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,010
IF THINGS WERE THE OTHER WAY AROUND

471
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,813
THERE WAS NOTHING YOU COULD PUT ON A LIST

472
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:38,417
THAT WOULD EVER MAKE ME NOT WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

473
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:42,421
WELL... THEN I GUESS THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US.

474
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,224
SEE, I'D NEVER MAKE A LIST.

475
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,840
I NEVER KNOW HOW LONG YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WAIT

476
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,243
IN THIS TYPE OF SITUATION BEFORE YOU CAN TALK AGAIN

477
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,043
YOU KNOW?

478
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,747
MAYBE A LITTLE LONGER.

479
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,954
NOW, IN SOME OF THESE RECIPES

480
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,056
THE QUANTITIES MAY SEEM JUST A LITTLE UNUSUAL.

481
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,058
LIKE THESE COCONUT MOCKOLATE HOLIDAY NUT BARS?

482
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,260
I'VE INDICATED

483
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,962
FOUR CUPS OF COCONUT AND FOUR CUPS OF CRUSHED NUT

484
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:27,366
AND ONLY, UH, ONE TABLESPOON OF MOCKOLATE.

485
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,967
DOESN'T MATTER.

486
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,669
WHAT?

487
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,071
OUR F.D.A. APPROVAL DIDN'T COME THROUGH.

488
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:37,176
SOMETHING ABOUT LABORATORY RATS.

489
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,777
OH, GOSH, I'M SORRY.

490
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:39,978
YEAH...

491
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,581
HELL, ANYHOO, HERE'S YOUR CHECK

492
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:46,385
AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THE TROUBLE YOU WENT THROUGH.

493
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,787
UH, LISTEN, YOU DIDN'T EAT A LOT OF IT

494
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,789
WHILE YOU WERE COOKING, DID YOU?

495
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,591
WELL, UH, I ATE SOME.

496
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,293
SOME-- THAT'S FINE. SOME IS FINE.

497
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,494
SOME IS NOT "A LOT."

498
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,495
OKAY.

499
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,598
SO IT DOESN'T BURN WHEN YOU PEE, DOES IT?

500
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:10,209

501
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,412
HELLO.

502
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,414
HI.

503
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,615
HI.

504
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,017
IS THAT HIM AGAIN?

505
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,719
TELL HIM I'D COME TO THE PHONE

506
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,721
BUT MY ANKLES ARE WEIGHING ME DOWN.

507
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:27,526
LISTEN, I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE BEST TIME.

508
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,729
LOOK, CAN... CAN YOU DO SOMETHING FOR ME?

509
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,131
SURE. WHAT?

510
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,534
OKAY.

511
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,135
ALL RIGHT.

512
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,341
MUSIC?

513
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,542
SURE.

514
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,548

515
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,550
 The next one is dedicated

516
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,151
to Rachel from Ross.

517
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,153
Rachel, he wants you to know

518
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,956
he's deeply sorry for what he did, and he hopes

519
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,958
you can find it in your heart to forgive him.

520
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:04,963
? See the stone set in your eyes ?

521
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:09,568
? See the thorn twist in your side ?

522
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:13,171
? I'll wait... for you ?

523
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,580
? Sleight of hand and twist of fate ?

524
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:27,185
? On a bed of nails she makes me wait ?

525
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:31,990
? And I'll wait without you... ?

526
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,393
 Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel

527
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,395
and she told us what Ross did.

528
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:40,399
It's pretty appalling, and, Ross, if you're listening

529
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,201
I don't want to play your song anymore.

530
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,608
Why don't we devote our time

531
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,610
to a couple that stands a chance?

532
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,513
Avery, Michelle is sorry she hit you with her car

533
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,316
and she hopes you two will work it out.

534
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:03,822
? There's a room where I can go and ?

535
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:09,428
? Tell my secrets to ?

536
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:16,234
? In my room ?

537
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:23,041
? In my room ?

538
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,645
? In my room. ?

540
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,751
HI. THANKS FOR COMING IN AGAIN.

541
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:33,952
OH, NOT AT ALL.

542
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,954
I HAVE NO MORALS, AND I NEED THE CASH.

543
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,956
IT'S LIKE I'M LOOKING IN A MIRROR.

544
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,459
ANYWAY

545
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,361
THEY'RE CALLED "FISHTACHIOS."

546
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:46,365
NOW, THEY TASTE EXACTLY LIKE PISTACHIOS, BUT THEY'RE

547
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,367
MADE PRIMARILY OF RECONSTITUTED FISH BITS.

548
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,469
HERE.

549
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,670
TRY ONE.

550
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,372
ALL RIGHT...

551
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,773
YOU'RE NOT ALLERGIC TO ANYTHING, ARE YOU?

552
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,274
CAT HAIR.

553
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,876
OH. SORRY.
