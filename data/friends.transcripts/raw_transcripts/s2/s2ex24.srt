2323
01:32:07,658 --> 01:32:09,259
HEY, JOEY. HOW'D THE AUDITION GO?

2324
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:11,662
INCREDIBLE. I MET THE DIRECTOR THIS TIME.

2325
01:32:11,662 --> 01:32:12,863
YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE WHO IT WAS.

2326
01:32:12,863 --> 01:32:14,364
 WHO?

2327
01:32:14,364 --> 01:32:15,966
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GIVE YOU ONE HINT--

2328
01:32:15,966 --> 01:32:17,167
WARREN BEATTY.

2329
01:32:17,567 --> 01:32:19,670
WOW!

2330
01:32:19,670 --> 01:32:23,573
YEAH. THERE'S JUST ONE THING THAT MIGHT BE KIND OF A PROBLEM.

2331
01:32:23,573 --> 01:32:25,976
SEE, I, UH, I HAD TO KISS THIS GUY.

2332
01:32:25,976 --> 01:32:28,779
BECAUSE HE WAS JUST SO DARN CUTE?

2333
01:32:28,779 --> 01:32:30,280
NO. AS PART OF THE AUDITION.

2334
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:33,483
SEE, I'M UP FOR THE PART OF THIS GUY WHO THE MAIN GUY KISSES.

2335
01:32:33,483 --> 01:32:35,385
WELL, HEY, YOU'RE AN ACTOR.

2336
01:32:35,786 --> 01:32:39,790
I SAY YOU JUST SUCK IT UP AND YOU DO IT.

2337
01:32:41,792 --> 01:32:43,794
OR YOU JUST DO IT.

2338
01:32:44,194 --> 01:32:45,395
I DID DO IT.

2339
01:32:45,395 --> 01:32:46,596
I'M A PROFESSIONAL.

2340
01:32:46,596 --> 01:32:49,399
BESIDES, MY FIRST GIRLFRIEND WAS LISA DeBATTISTA

2341
01:32:49,399 --> 01:32:51,401
SO I'M NO STRANGER TO THE MUSTACHE.

2342
01:32:51,401 --> 01:32:54,604
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

2343
01:32:54,604 --> 01:32:57,107
SEE, AFTER THE SCENE, MR. BEATTY COMES UP TO ME

2344
01:32:57,107 --> 01:32:59,910
AND HE SAYS, "GOOD ACTOR. BAD KISSER."

2345
01:32:59,910 --> 01:33:01,511
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

2346
01:33:01,511 --> 01:33:03,113
ME, NOT A GOOD KISSER.

2347
01:33:03,113 --> 01:33:05,115
THAT'S LIKE, LIKE...

2348
01:33:05,115 --> 01:33:07,918
MOTHER TERESA-- NOT A GOOD MOTHER.

2349
01:33:09,119 --> 01:33:11,521
AW, COME ON. WHO CARES WHAT THAT GUY THINKS?

2350
01:33:11,521 --> 01:33:13,924
WHAT DOES WARREN BEATTY KNOW ABOUT KISSING?

2351
01:33:15,926 --> 01:33:17,127
OH.

2352
01:33:17,127 --> 01:33:18,328

2353
01:33:18,328 --> 01:33:23,333

2354
01:33:23,333 --> 01:33:28,739
?  ?

2355
01:33:28,739 --> 01:33:30,440
?  ?

2356
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:33,243
?  ?

2357
01:33:33,243 --> 01:33:38,148
?  ?

2358
01:33:38,148 --> 01:33:40,951
?  ?

2359
01:33:40,951 --> 01:33:43,253
?  ?

2360
01:33:43,253 --> 01:33:46,656
?  ?

2361
01:33:46,656 --> 01:33:49,259
?  ?

2362
01:33:49,259 --> 01:33:52,062
?  ?

2363
01:33:52,062 --> 01:33:54,264
?  ?

2364
01:33:54,264 --> 01:33:56,967
?  ?

2365
01:33:56,967 --> 01:34:03,573
?  ?

2366
01:34:05,876 --> 01:34:07,477
HEY, WHAT DID YOUR AGENT SAY?

2367
01:34:07,477 --> 01:34:09,880
YUP. THIS KISS THING IS DEFINITELY A PROBLEM.

2368
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:12,682
MR. BEATTY WANTS TO SEE IT AGAIN ON MONDAY.

2369
01:34:12,682 --> 01:34:15,585
MAN, I GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I'M DOING WRONG.

2370
01:34:15,585 --> 01:34:18,789
OH, OKAY, ONE OF YOU GIRLS COME OVER HERE AND KISS ME.

2371
01:34:18,789 --> 01:34:19,890
FORGET IT.

2372
01:34:20,290 --> 01:34:21,491
RIGHT.

2373
01:34:21,591 --> 01:34:23,593
HEY, COME ON. I NEED YOUR HELP HERE.

2374
01:34:23,593 --> 01:34:24,795
ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO IT.

2375
01:34:24,795 --> 01:34:26,396
I'VE KISSED HIM BEFORE.

2376
01:34:26,396 --> 01:34:27,197
I CAN DO IT AGAIN.

2377
01:34:27,597 --> 01:34:29,599
SEE THIS? HUH? THIS IS A FRIEND.

2378
01:34:29,599 --> 01:34:30,600
UH HUH. LET'S GO.

2379
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,602
OH, WAIT. I HAVE GUM.

2380
01:34:32,602 --> 01:34:34,204
OH.

2381
01:34:34,204 --> 01:34:35,806
OKAY.

2382
01:34:44,214 --> 01:34:45,816
GOOD. VERY GOOD.

2383
01:34:45,816 --> 01:34:47,417
FIRM BUT TENDER.

2384
01:34:47,417 --> 01:34:49,219
I'D RECOMMEND YOU TO A FRIEND.

2385
01:34:49,219 --> 01:34:51,221
THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

2386
01:34:51,221 --> 01:34:52,422
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

2387
01:34:52,422 --> 01:34:55,625
JOEY, MAYBE YOU'RE JUST NOT USED TO KISSING MEN.

2388
01:34:55,625 --> 01:34:57,427
MAYBE YOU JUST TENSED UP A LITTLE BIT.

2389
01:34:57,427 --> 01:34:59,429
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO WORK ON.

2390
01:34:59,429 --> 01:35:01,431
YEAH. THAT MAKES SENSE.

2391
01:35:07,037 --> 01:35:08,638
OVER MY DEAD BODY.

2392
01:35:08,638 --> 01:35:11,341

2393
01:35:11,741 --> 01:35:14,244
AND I'LL BE USING HIS DEAD BODY AS A SHIELD.

2394
01:35:18,648 --> 01:35:21,051
 COME ON OUT, HONEY.

2395
01:35:21,051 --> 01:35:23,954
I'M TELLING YOU, YOU LOOK GOOD.

2396
01:35:23,954 --> 01:35:26,556
TELL HER SHE LOOKS GOOD. TELL HER SHE LOOKS GOOD.

2397
01:35:31,261 --> 01:35:32,462
OH, MY GOD!

2398
01:35:32,462 --> 01:35:33,663

2399
01:35:35,365 --> 01:35:38,468
YOU LOOK SO GOOD.

2400
01:35:38,468 --> 01:35:40,971
I CANNOT BELIEVE I HAVE TO WALK DOWN THE AISLE

2401
01:35:41,371 --> 01:35:42,973
IN FRONT OF 200 PEOPLE

2402
01:35:42,973 --> 01:35:46,576
LOOKING LIKE SOMETHING YOU DRINK WHEN YOU'RE NAUSEOUS.

2403
01:35:46,576 --> 01:35:50,881
SO DON'T. I DON'T SEE WHY WE HAVE TO GO TO THIS THING ANYWAY.

2404
01:35:50,881 --> 01:35:52,883
IT'S YOUR EX FIANCE'S WEDDING.

2405
01:35:52,883 --> 01:35:55,285
BECAUSE I PROMISED MINDY I WOULD.

2406
01:35:55,285 --> 01:35:57,587
YEAH, WELL, YOU PROMISED BARRY

2407
01:35:57,587 --> 01:35:58,889
YOU'D MARRY HIM.

2408
01:35:58,889 --> 01:36:01,091
LOOK, YOU GUYS, I HAVE TO GO.

2409
01:36:01,091 --> 01:36:02,692
I'M THE MAID OF HONOR.

2410
01:36:02,692 --> 01:36:04,294
BESIDES, YOU KNOW WHAT?

2411
01:36:04,294 --> 01:36:06,696
I NEED TO BE IN A ROOM AGAIN WITH THESE PEOPLE

2412
01:36:06,696 --> 01:36:09,099
AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF.

2413
01:36:11,501 --> 01:36:13,904

2414
01:36:15,605 --> 01:36:18,808
OOH... SOMEONE'S WEARING THE SAME CLOTHES

2415
01:36:18,808 --> 01:36:20,410
THEY HAD ON LAST NIGHT.

2416
01:36:20,410 --> 01:36:21,611
DID SOMEONE GET A LITTLE ACTION?

2417
01:36:21,611 --> 01:36:22,812
YEAH, I MAY HAVE.

2418
01:36:22,812 --> 01:36:24,614
WHOO HOO! STUD.

2419
01:36:25,815 --> 01:36:27,517
WHAT DID SHE LOOK LIKE?

2420
01:36:27,517 --> 01:36:28,919
WELL, WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY MET.

2421
01:36:28,919 --> 01:36:30,120
WE JUST STAYED UP

2422
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:31,721
ALL NIGHT TALKING ON THE INTERNET.

2423
01:36:31,721 --> 01:36:32,923
WHOO HOO! GEEK.

2424
01:36:32,923 --> 01:36:34,524
I LIKE THIS GIRL, OKAY?

2425
01:36:34,524 --> 01:36:36,526
I SERIOUSLY LIKE THIS GIRL.

2426
01:36:36,526 --> 01:36:38,128
YOU KNOW HOW SOMETIMES

2427
01:36:38,128 --> 01:36:40,931
I TEND TO GET A LITTLE DEFENDED AND QUIPPY?

2428
01:36:40,931 --> 01:36:41,531
GET OUT.

2429
01:36:41,531 --> 01:36:43,133
UH UH. PLEASE.

2430
01:36:43,133 --> 01:36:46,336
WELL, SHE TOTALLY CALLED ME ON IT, OKAY?

2431
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:48,738
SHE SAID, "CUT IT OUT. GET REAL."

2432
01:36:48,738 --> 01:36:49,940
AND I DID.

2433
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:51,841
WOW.

2434
01:36:51,841 --> 01:36:53,843
WHAT'S THAT LIKE?

2435
01:36:54,744 --> 01:36:57,547
IT'S LIKE THIS. ME.

2436
01:36:57,547 --> 01:36:59,549
NO JOKES.

2437
01:36:59,549 --> 01:37:00,750
ALL RIGHT, STOP IT.

2438
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:01,952
YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT.

2439
01:37:03,453 --> 01:37:05,655
OOH, YEAH. I DON'T LIKE YOU THIS WAY.

2440
01:37:05,655 --> 01:37:07,357
ALL RIGHT.

2441
01:37:07,357 --> 01:37:08,558
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

2442
01:37:08,558 --> 01:37:10,160
BYE, RICHARD. BYE BYE.

2443
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:11,361
BYE, SWEETIE.

2444
01:37:11,361 --> 01:37:12,562
I LOVE YOU.

2445
01:37:12,562 --> 01:37:14,164
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

2446
01:37:18,168 --> 01:37:19,369

2447
01:37:19,369 --> 01:37:22,973
"I THINK MY BOYFRIEND'S EVER SO DREAMY.

2448
01:37:22,973 --> 01:37:27,777
I WONDER WHAT OUR WEDDING'S GOING TO BE LIKE."

2449
01:37:27,777 --> 01:37:30,180
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

2450
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:31,381
WHAT WEDDING?

2451
01:37:31,381 --> 01:37:33,383
COME ON. LIKE YOU NEVER TALK ABOUT THAT?

2452
01:37:33,383 --> 01:37:34,985
NO. NEVER.

2453
01:37:34,985 --> 01:37:36,987
WE'RE JUST LIVING IN THE MOMENT.

2454
01:37:36,987 --> 01:37:38,989
GOD, IT IS SO NICE, FOR ONCE

2455
01:37:38,989 --> 01:37:41,791
NOT TO GET ALL HUNG UP ON WHERE THIS IS GOING.

2456
01:37:41,791 --> 01:37:43,393
YOU AFRAID TO ASK HIM?

2457
01:37:43,393 --> 01:37:44,694
COULD NOT BE MORE TERRIFIED.

2458
01:37:44,694 --> 01:37:46,296
WELL, I THINK YOU SHOULD

2459
01:37:46,296 --> 01:37:48,298
SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THE MARRIAGE THING.

2460
01:37:48,298 --> 01:37:49,499
GIVE RACHEL ANOTHER CHANCE

2461
01:37:49,499 --> 01:37:51,901
TO DRESS UP LIKE PRINCESS BUBBLE YUM.

2462
01:37:51,901 --> 01:37:55,105

2463
01:37:56,306 --> 01:37:58,308
I WAS LAUGHING AT THIS QUIP

2464
01:37:58,308 --> 01:38:00,310
LENO MADE LAST NIGHT.

2465
01:38:01,511 --> 01:38:03,913
I WASN'T LAUGHING AT YOUR DRESS.

2466
01:38:03,913 --> 01:38:05,115
I LOVE YOU.

2467
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:11,221
 WHERE'S BENNY?

2468
01:38:11,221 --> 01:38:12,822
THERE HE IS.

2469
01:38:12,822 --> 01:38:15,125
WHERE'S BENNY?

2470
01:38:15,125 --> 01:38:17,927
THERE HE IS.

2471
01:38:17,927 --> 01:38:21,631
AW... YOU KNOW, THAT'S PROBABLY WHY BABIES LEARN TO TALK--

2472
01:38:21,631 --> 01:38:23,233
SO THEY CAN TELL GROWN UPS

2473
01:38:23,233 --> 01:38:25,235
TO CUT IT OUT.

2474
01:38:25,235 --> 01:38:28,038
HEY, YOU KNOW, I GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU.

2475
01:38:28,038 --> 01:38:30,440
JUST A LITTLE THING, NO PRESSURE.

2476
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:31,941
OKAY.

2477
01:38:31,941 --> 01:38:37,047
DO YOU EVER, UH, LIKE, THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE?

2478
01:38:37,047 --> 01:38:38,548
SURE I DO.

2479
01:38:38,548 --> 01:38:40,750
YEAH? AM I IN IT?

2480
01:38:41,851 --> 01:38:44,654
HONEY, YOU ARE IT.

2481
01:38:44,654 --> 01:38:46,356
OH, GOD.

2482
01:38:46,356 --> 01:38:48,758
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET SO LUCKY.

2483
01:38:48,758 --> 01:38:49,959
YEAH?

2484
01:38:49,959 --> 01:38:50,760
YEAH.

2485
01:38:53,863 --> 01:38:55,465
KEEP TALKING.

2486
01:38:55,865 --> 01:38:58,768
WELL, UM, SOMETIMES I THINK ABOUT SELLING MY PRACTICE.

2487
01:38:58,768 --> 01:39:00,370
MM HMM.

2488
01:39:00,370 --> 01:39:02,772
WE COULD MOVE TO FRANCE.

2489
01:39:02,772 --> 01:39:03,973
MM HMM.

2490
01:39:03,973 --> 01:39:05,575
MAKE FRENCH TOAST.

2491
01:39:05,575 --> 01:39:09,579
OOH. OKAY, SO, UM, WE'RE IN FRANCE...

2492
01:39:09,579 --> 01:39:10,780
MM HMM.

2493
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:12,782
AND, UH, WE'RE MAKING THE TOAST...

2494
01:39:12,782 --> 01:39:14,384
MM HMM.

2495
01:39:14,384 --> 01:39:17,587
DO YOU SEE A LITTLE BASSINET IN THE CORNER?

2496
01:39:17,587 --> 01:39:19,989
LIKE A HOUND?

2497
01:39:21,191 --> 01:39:23,993
NOT A BASSET.

2498
01:39:23,993 --> 01:39:25,995
A BASSINET.

2499
01:39:27,497 --> 01:39:30,700
YOU REALLY NEED THE BASSINET?

2500
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:32,001
WELL, I JUST THINK

2501
01:39:32,001 --> 01:39:34,804
THE BABY WOULD KEEP FALLING OFF THE DOG.

2502
01:39:36,406 --> 01:39:39,609
DO YOU, UM, DO YOU NOT SEE KIDS IN OUR FUTURE?

2503
01:39:39,609 --> 01:39:43,613
OH... HEY, I LOVE CHILDREN.

2504
01:39:43,613 --> 01:39:45,615
I HAVE CHILDREN.

2505
01:39:45,615 --> 01:39:49,119
BUT I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE 70 WHEN OUR KIDS GO OFF TO COLLEGE

2506
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:50,720
AND OUR LIFE CAN FINALLY START.

2507
01:39:53,823 --> 01:39:58,128
LOOK, I WANT YOU.

2508
01:39:58,128 --> 01:39:59,729
NOW.

2509
01:39:59,729 --> 01:40:01,931
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

2510
01:40:01,931 --> 01:40:04,334
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS NOW.

2511
01:40:04,534 --> 01:40:06,536
REALLY. I MEAN, THIS IS SO, LIKE

2512
01:40:06,936 --> 01:40:08,938
WAY, WAY, WAY IN THE FUTURE.

2513
01:40:08,938 --> 01:40:10,540
I'M TALKING HOVERCRAFTS

2514
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:12,542
AND APES TAKING OVER THE PLANET.

2515
01:40:16,946 --> 01:40:18,148
COME ON, CHANDLER.

2516
01:40:18,148 --> 01:40:20,150
I WANT THIS PART SO MUCH.

2517
01:40:20,150 --> 01:40:21,751
JUST ONE KISS.

2518
01:40:21,751 --> 01:40:23,353
I WON'T TELL ANYONE.

2519
01:40:23,353 --> 01:40:26,156
JOEY, "NO" MEANS NO.

2520
01:40:27,357 --> 01:40:28,958
HEY, HI.

2521
01:40:28,958 --> 01:40:30,560
HEY.

2522
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,962
I'M SORRY. WE DON'T HAVE YOUR SHEEP.

2523
01:40:37,867 --> 01:40:39,869
OH, RACH, I THINK YOU LOOK CUTE.

2524
01:40:41,871 --> 01:40:43,173
AND YOU-- HUH! YOU...

2525
01:40:43,173 --> 01:40:45,575
YOU I COULD EAT WITH A SPOON.

2526
01:40:45,575 --> 01:40:46,576
GET AWAY FROM ME.

2527
01:40:46,576 --> 01:40:48,178
I SAID NO.

2528
01:40:50,180 --> 01:40:52,081
GUYS, RICHARD BUZZED-- HE'S WAITING DOWNSTAIRS.

2529
01:40:52,081 --> 01:40:53,583
OH, RICHARD'S HERE?

2530
01:40:53,583 --> 01:40:54,784
I SHOULD RUN DOWN

2531
01:40:54,784 --> 01:40:56,186
AND SAY GOOD BYE TO HIM.

2532
01:40:58,988 --> 01:41:00,590
BYE. BYE.

2533
01:41:00,590 --> 01:41:02,592
GOOD LUCK.

2534
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:04,994
SO, HOW'S YOUR DATE WITH YOUR CYBER CHICK GOING?

2535
01:41:04,994 --> 01:41:07,197
OOH, HEY, WHAT IS ALL THAT?

2536
01:41:07,197 --> 01:41:08,798
OH, IT'S A WEB SITE.

2537
01:41:08,798 --> 01:41:10,400
IT'S THE GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM.

2538
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:15,205
SEE, UH, SHE LIKES ART, AND... I LIKE FUNNY WORDS.

2539
01:41:16,406 --> 01:41:18,408
WHAT DOES SHE MEAN BY "HH"?

2540
01:41:18,608 --> 01:41:22,212
IT... MEANS WE'RE HOLDING HANDS.

2541
01:41:23,413 --> 01:41:25,215
ARE YOU THE CUTEST?

2542
01:41:25,215 --> 01:41:27,617
I'M AFRAID I MIGHT JUST BE.

2543
01:41:27,717 --> 01:41:30,119
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK IS SO GREAT?

2544
01:41:30,119 --> 01:41:32,922
THAT YOU ARE TOTALLY INTO THIS PERSON

2545
01:41:32,922 --> 01:41:36,125
AND YET, FOR ALL YOU KNOW, SHE COULD BE, LIKE

2546
01:41:36,125 --> 01:41:38,928
90 YEARS OLD OR HAVE TWO HEADS, OR...

2547
01:41:38,928 --> 01:41:40,530
IT COULD BE A GUY.

2548
01:41:41,731 --> 01:41:43,733
OKAY, IT'S NOT A GUY, ALL RIGHT?

2549
01:41:43,733 --> 01:41:45,335
I KNOW HER.

2550
01:41:45,335 --> 01:41:47,737
IT COULD BE, LIKE, A BIG, GIANT GUY.

2551
01:41:49,739 --> 01:41:52,141
MAN, I GOT THIS CLOSE TO HIM

2552
01:41:52,141 --> 01:41:55,345
AND MONICA KNEED ME IN THE BACK.

2553
01:41:55,345 --> 01:41:56,946
WHAT'S GOING ON?

2554
01:41:56,946 --> 01:41:58,548
WE WERE JUST WONDERING

2555
01:41:58,548 --> 01:42:00,149
IF CHANDLER'S GIRLFRIEND'S A GIRL.

2556
01:42:00,149 --> 01:42:02,452
JUST ASK HER HOW LONG SHE'S GOING TO LIVE.

2557
01:42:02,452 --> 01:42:04,053
WOMEN LIVE LONGER THAN MEN.

2558
01:42:07,557 --> 01:42:09,959
HOW DO YOU NOT FALL DOWN MORE?

2559
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:12,762
OKAY, ASK HER

2560
01:42:12,862 --> 01:42:15,265
WHAT IS HER CURRENT METHOD OF BIRTH CONTROL.

2561
01:42:15,265 --> 01:42:16,866
ALL RIGHT.

2562
01:42:20,069 --> 01:42:23,273
"MY HUSBAND IS SLEEPING WITH HIS SECRETARY."

2563
01:42:24,274 --> 01:42:26,576
SHE'S MARRIED?

2564
01:42:26,576 --> 01:42:29,279
WELL, AT LEAST WE KNOW SHE'S A WOMAN.

2565
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:33,283
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S MARRIED.

2566
01:42:33,283 --> 01:42:35,285
OH, MAN, I'M SORRY.

2567
01:42:37,287 --> 01:42:40,089
THIS MUST BE REALLY TOUGH FOR YOU, HUH?

2568
01:42:43,293 --> 01:42:45,295
SO, I READ THIS ARTICLE THE OTHER DAY

2569
01:42:45,295 --> 01:42:47,297
AND IT SAYS YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED

2570
01:42:47,297 --> 01:42:48,498
TO THROW RICE AT WEDDINGS

2571
01:42:48,498 --> 01:42:51,301
BECAUSE WHEN PIGEONS EAT RICE, IT KILLS THEM.

2572
01:42:51,301 --> 01:42:54,304
OH, SO THAT'S WHY YOU NEVER SEE PIGEONS IN SUSHI BARS.

2573
01:42:54,304 --> 01:42:55,905

2574
01:42:55,905 --> 01:42:57,507
SEE, WE'RE HAVING FUN.

2575
01:42:57,507 --> 01:42:59,108
OH, ABSOLUTELY. YEAH, YOU KNOW

2576
01:42:59,108 --> 01:43:01,110
I'M NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT THAT THING

2577
01:43:01,110 --> 01:43:03,513
THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE THINKING ABOUT.

2578
01:43:03,513 --> 01:43:04,714
NEITHER AM I.

2579
01:43:04,714 --> 01:43:05,515
HMM MM. YEAH.

2580
01:43:05,915 --> 01:43:07,517
HEY, THERE. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

2581
01:43:07,517 --> 01:43:09,118
YEAH. WHEN I WAS IN THE BATHROOM

2582
01:43:09,118 --> 01:43:12,322
I SAW THE WINDOW THAT I CRAWLED OUT OF AT MY WEDDING

2583
01:43:12,322 --> 01:43:13,923
AND... GOD, I JUST START THINKING

2584
01:43:13,923 --> 01:43:15,925
I SHOULDN'T BE HERE, YOU KNOW? I SHOULDN'T.

2585
01:43:15,925 --> 01:43:17,927
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT ME

2586
01:43:17,927 --> 01:43:20,930
AND JUDGING ME AND THINKING ABOUT THE LAST TIME.

2587
01:43:20,930 --> 01:43:22,532
SWEETIE, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY, ALL RIGHT?

2588
01:43:22,532 --> 01:43:23,733
IT'S A WEDDING.

2589
01:43:23,733 --> 01:43:25,735
GENERALLY, PEOPLE FOCUS ON THE BRIDE.

2590
01:43:25,735 --> 01:43:26,536
GOD, I KNOW.

2591
01:43:26,536 --> 01:43:27,737
YOU'RE RIGHT.

2592
01:43:27,737 --> 01:43:29,339
ALL RIGHTY! EVERYBODY LOOK AT ME.

2593
01:43:29,339 --> 01:43:30,540
GOOD. ALL RIGHT.

2594
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:31,741
IT'S TIME.

2595
01:43:31,741 --> 01:43:33,343
BRIDESMAIDS AND USHERS...

2596
01:43:33,343 --> 01:43:35,345
LET'S SEE TWO LINES. THANK YOU.

2597
01:43:35,345 --> 01:43:36,946
OKAY.

2598
01:43:36,946 --> 01:43:38,548
I'LL SEE YOU AFTER THE THING.

2599
01:43:38,548 --> 01:43:40,149
OKAY. GOOD LUCK.

2600
01:43:40,149 --> 01:43:41,351
THANK YOU. OKAY.

2601
01:43:41,351 --> 01:43:43,753
OKAY.

2602
01:43:43,753 --> 01:43:44,954
AH.

2603
01:43:54,564 --> 01:43:57,066
GOD! WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

2604
01:43:57,066 --> 01:43:58,267
I'M SORRY. WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

2605
01:43:58,668 --> 01:44:00,269
STAND UP AND SHOUT, "HEY, RACHEL, YOUR BUTT IS SHOWING"?

2606
01:44:00,670 --> 01:44:02,271
YEAH. BETTER YOU THAN BARRY'S UNCLE.

2607
01:44:02,271 --> 01:44:04,273
OH, MY GOD, THIS IS SO HUMILIATING.

2608
01:44:04,273 --> 01:44:06,676
I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT TOPS THAT ONE

2609
01:44:06,676 --> 01:44:08,277
WAS WHEN I WAS IN EIGHTH GRADE

2610
01:44:08,277 --> 01:44:10,279
AND I HAD TO SING THE "COPACABANA"

2611
01:44:10,279 --> 01:44:11,881
IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE SCHOOL.

2612
01:44:11,881 --> 01:44:13,483
I THINK I GOT TWO LINES INTO IT

2613
01:44:13,483 --> 01:44:15,084
BEFORE I RAN AND FREAKED OUT.

2614
01:44:15,084 --> 01:44:17,887
OH, MY GOD, MY ENTIRE LIFE'S FLASHING BEFORE MY EYES.

2615
01:44:18,287 --> 01:44:19,889
RACH, HEY, LOOK. I REMEMBER THAT.

2616
01:44:20,289 --> 01:44:21,591
IT WASN'T SO BAD.

2617
01:44:21,591 --> 01:44:22,792
OH, ROSS, WOULD YOU STOP?

2618
01:44:22,792 --> 01:44:24,794
YOU GOT ME. I'M DATING YOU.

2619
01:44:26,396 --> 01:44:27,597
RACHEL.

2620
01:44:27,597 --> 01:44:28,798
HI, MR. WEINBERG.

2621
01:44:28,798 --> 01:44:30,400
HI, MRS. WEINBERG.

2622
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:32,402
IT'S SO WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU AGAIN, MY DEAR.

2623
01:44:32,402 --> 01:44:36,005
IN FACT, I HARDLY EXPECTED TO SEE SO MUCH.

2624
01:44:36,005 --> 01:44:37,206
YOU TOLD ME

2625
01:44:37,206 --> 01:44:39,208
YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

2626
01:44:39,208 --> 01:44:40,810
I TELL YOU A LOT OF THINGS.

2627
01:44:40,810 --> 01:44:43,813
WELL, IT'S WONDERFUL

2628
01:44:43,813 --> 01:44:45,815
TO HAVE YOU UP AND ABOUT AGAIN, DEAR.

2629
01:44:45,815 --> 01:44:48,618
STAY WELL.

2630
01:44:48,618 --> 01:44:50,620
OKAY. NOW, THAT IS THE THIRD TIME

2631
01:44:50,620 --> 01:44:53,823
SOMEONE HAS SAID SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO ME TODAY.

2632
01:44:53,823 --> 01:44:54,624
RACH? RACH!

2633
01:44:54,624 --> 01:44:55,825
OH, HI.

2634
01:44:55,825 --> 01:44:57,026
OH, MY GOD!

2635
01:44:57,026 --> 01:44:58,227
I'M MARRIED!

2636
01:44:58,227 --> 01:45:01,030
I'M MRS. DR. BARRY HUNTER HYPHEN FARBER.

2637
01:45:01,030 --> 01:45:04,233
OH, HONEY. I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, MIN.

2638
01:45:04,534 --> 01:45:05,735
MIN?

2639
01:45:05,735 --> 01:45:06,936
OH, RACH. STILL HERE.

2640
01:45:06,936 --> 01:45:08,137
AT OUR WEDDING

2641
01:45:08,137 --> 01:45:10,540
THEY WERE PACKING UP THE CHOPPED LIVER

2642
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:11,741
ABOUT NOW.

2643
01:45:11,741 --> 01:45:13,743
OH, YEAH, I LOVE THAT STORY.

2644
01:45:13,743 --> 01:45:17,046
UM, I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU GUYS.

2645
01:45:17,046 --> 01:45:18,648
WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP SAYING

2646
01:45:18,648 --> 01:45:20,650
IT'S GOOD TO SEE ME UP AND ABOUT?

2647
01:45:20,650 --> 01:45:23,853
WELL, UH, AFTER YOU RAN OUT ON YOUR WEDDING

2648
01:45:23,853 --> 01:45:28,257
BARRY'S PARENTS TOLD PEOPLE YOU WERE SORT OF... INSANE.

2649
01:45:28,257 --> 01:45:30,159
INSANE?

2650
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:31,961
FROM THE SYPHILIS.

2651
01:45:31,961 --> 01:45:33,963
WHAT?!

2652
01:45:33,963 --> 01:45:35,665
WELL, WHAT WERE THEY GOING TO SAY?

2653
01:45:35,665 --> 01:45:38,067
YOU DIDN'T LOVE ME ANYMORE? COME ON.

2654
01:45:38,167 --> 01:45:42,271
YOUR CHOICES WERE THAT ORSYPHILIS?!

2655
01:45:42,271 --> 01:45:44,273
HEY, SWEETIE, AT LEAST THIS PUTS

2656
01:45:44,273 --> 01:45:47,076
YOUR WHOLE TUSHIE SHOW INTO PERSPECTIVE.

2657
01:45:49,479 --> 01:45:51,080
ANGELA?

2658
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:52,281
JOEY TRIBBIANI.

2659
01:45:52,281 --> 01:45:55,084
LISTEN, UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?

2660
01:45:55,084 --> 01:45:57,487
I KNOW YOU'RE SEEING THAT GUY.

2661
01:45:57,487 --> 01:46:00,690
I WAS THINKING MAYBE YOU COULD BRING HIM...

2662
01:46:00,690 --> 01:46:02,391
HELLO? HELLO?

2663
01:46:02,391 --> 01:46:03,593
AH!

2664
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,702

2665
01:46:12,702 --> 01:46:14,303
AREN'T YOU GOING TO ANSWER HER?

2666
01:46:14,303 --> 01:46:17,106
THAT'S, LIKE, THE TENTH "BING BONG" MESSAGE SHE SENT.

2667
01:46:17,106 --> 01:46:18,708
SHE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT'S WRONG.

2668
01:46:18,708 --> 01:46:19,909
WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT'S WRONG?

2669
01:46:19,909 --> 01:46:21,110
YOU'RE MARRIED.

2670
01:46:21,110 --> 01:46:22,712
THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG.

2671
01:46:24,313 --> 01:46:25,515
OH, MY.

2672
01:46:25,515 --> 01:46:26,716
WHAT?

2673
01:46:26,716 --> 01:46:28,718
SHE WANTS TO MEET YOU IN PERSON.

2674
01:46:28,718 --> 01:46:31,320
HEY, LOOK, PHOEBE, I WANTED TO MEET HER IN PERSON, TOO, OKAY?

2675
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:32,922
BUT SHE'S MARRIED.

2676
01:46:32,922 --> 01:46:34,123
SHE HAS A HUSBAND.

2677
01:46:34,123 --> 01:46:36,526
WHAT IF THE HUSBAND PERSON IS THE WRONG GUY

2678
01:46:36,526 --> 01:46:37,727
AND YOU ARE THE RIGHT GUY?

2679
01:46:37,727 --> 01:46:40,429
YOU DON'T GET CHANCES LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME.

2680
01:46:40,429 --> 01:46:42,131
IF YOU DON'T MEET HER NOW

2681
01:46:42,131 --> 01:46:44,133
YOU'RE GOING TO BE KICKING YOURSELF

2682
01:46:44,133 --> 01:46:46,536
WHEN YOU'RE 80, WHICH IS HARD TO DO

2683
01:46:46,536 --> 01:46:48,638
AND THAT'S HOW YOU BREAK A HIP.

2684
01:46:48,638 --> 01:46:49,839
I DON'T KNOW.

2685
01:46:49,839 --> 01:46:51,040

2686
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:52,742
LISTEN TO THAT.

2687
01:46:52,742 --> 01:46:53,943
THOSE ARE THE BING BONGS

2688
01:46:53,943 --> 01:46:55,545
OF A WOMAN IN LOVE WITH YOU.

2689
01:46:57,847 --> 01:46:59,849
OKAY. I'LL DO IT.

2690
01:46:59,849 --> 01:47:00,850
OH, YAY! OKAY, GREAT.

2691
01:47:00,850 --> 01:47:02,051
GO PUT ON YOUR SHOES

2692
01:47:02,051 --> 01:47:04,053
AND THEN MARCH OUT THERE AND MEET HER.

2693
01:47:04,453 --> 01:47:05,655
OH, MY GOD. NO! WAIT.

2694
01:47:05,655 --> 01:47:07,657
YOU HAVE TO TAKE A SHOWER, BECAUSE... EWW!

2695
01:47:07,657 --> 01:47:09,258
AND I'LL GET THE...

2696
01:47:09,258 --> 01:47:11,260
NO, YOU'VE TO... ANSWER HER.

2697
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:12,461
ANSWER HER FIRST.

2698
01:47:12,862 --> 01:47:15,264
NO, NO. MAKE SOME COFFEE, BECAUSE IT'S TOO MUCH.

2699
01:47:16,866 --> 01:47:18,467
? TALL AND TAN ?

2700
01:47:18,467 --> 01:47:20,069
? AND YOUNG AND LOVELY... ?

2701
01:47:20,069 --> 01:47:21,671
OKAY. ONE MORE, PLEASE. COME ON.

2702
01:47:21,671 --> 01:47:23,673
I'M GOING TO GET IT IN THIS TIME. I WILL.

2703
01:47:23,673 --> 01:47:25,274
OKAY. LAST CHANCE.

2704
01:47:25,274 --> 01:47:30,479
? AND WHEN SHE PASSES, EACH ONE SHE PASSES GOES, "AH..." ?

2705
01:47:30,479 --> 01:47:33,282
AGAIN, I'M SORRY.

2706
01:47:33,282 --> 01:47:35,284
? WHEN SHE WALKS, IT'S LIKE A SAMBA ?

2707
01:47:35,384 --> 01:47:37,787
? SWINGS SO COOL, SWAYS SO GENTLY... ?

2708
01:47:37,987 --> 01:47:38,788
YOU KNOW WHAT?

2709
01:47:38,788 --> 01:47:40,790
MAYBE I DON'T NEED TO HAVE CHILDREN.

2710
01:47:40,790 --> 01:47:44,293
MAYBE I JUST THINK I DO, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SOCIETY--

2711
01:47:44,293 --> 01:47:46,696
AND BY THAT, I MEAN MY MOM--

2712
01:47:46,696 --> 01:47:49,498
HAS... HAS ALWAYS CONVINCED ME THAT I...

2713
01:47:49,899 --> 01:47:53,903
? OH, BUT I WANT HER SO BADLY... ?

2714
01:47:53,903 --> 01:47:55,504
I DO.

2715
01:47:55,504 --> 01:47:57,506
I HAVE TO HAVE CHILDREN.

2716
01:47:57,506 --> 01:47:59,108
I'M SORRY. I JUST DO.

2717
01:47:59,508 --> 01:48:00,710

2718
01:48:00,710 --> 01:48:01,911
 YO!

2719
01:48:02,211 --> 01:48:03,813
CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE?

2720
01:48:04,213 --> 01:48:05,815
BEST MAN MAKING A TOAST HERE.

2721
01:48:05,815 --> 01:48:06,816
THANK YOU.

2722
01:48:06,816 --> 01:48:08,618

2723
01:48:08,618 --> 01:48:10,620
I REMEMBER WHEN BARRY GOT HOME

2724
01:48:10,620 --> 01:48:13,422
FROM HIS FIRST DATE WITH RACHEL...

2725
01:48:15,825 --> 01:48:17,426
WHAT? YOU HIRED THE SAME BAND.

2726
01:48:17,426 --> 01:48:19,428
I CAN'T USE THE SAME SPEECH?

2727
01:48:19,428 --> 01:48:20,830

2728
01:48:20,830 --> 01:48:22,732
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

2729
01:48:22,732 --> 01:48:24,934
ANYWAY, I WISH YOU BOTH

2730
01:48:24,934 --> 01:48:26,936
A... A WONDERFUL LIFE TOGETHER.

2731
01:48:26,936 --> 01:48:28,137
AWW...

2732
01:48:28,137 --> 01:48:29,338
AND RACHEL...

2733
01:48:29,338 --> 01:48:30,439
WHAT?

2734
01:48:30,439 --> 01:48:31,641
NO, NO, NO-- IN ALL SERIOUSNESS

2735
01:48:31,641 --> 01:48:33,142
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF WOMEN

2736
01:48:33,142 --> 01:48:35,945
WHO WOULD HAVE HAD THE GUTS TO COME BACK HERE TONIGHT

2737
01:48:35,945 --> 01:48:38,648
AND EVEN FEWER WHO'D DO IT WITH THEIR ASSES

2738
01:48:39,048 --> 01:48:40,349
HANGING OUT!

2739
01:48:40,349 --> 01:48:41,951
CLASSIC!

2740
01:48:41,951 --> 01:48:44,453

2741
01:48:44,453 --> 01:48:46,355

2742
01:48:46,355 --> 01:48:49,558
UH, I'D LIKE TO ADD SOMETHING TO THAT.

2743
01:48:49,558 --> 01:48:51,460
WHAT ARE YOU ADDING? WHY ARE YOU ADDING?

2744
01:48:51,460 --> 01:48:53,062
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

2745
01:48:53,062 --> 01:48:54,964
MOST OF YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

2746
01:48:54,964 --> 01:48:56,966
UH, I'M RACHEL'S BOYFRIEND...

2747
01:48:56,966 --> 01:48:59,168
OH, DEAR GOD.

2748
01:48:59,168 --> 01:49:00,369
...ROSS.

2749
01:49:00,369 --> 01:49:02,772
UH, AND, UH, I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY

2750
01:49:02,772 --> 01:49:05,174
THAT IT DID TAKE A LOT OF COURAGE

2751
01:49:05,174 --> 01:49:07,576
FOR RACHEL TO COME HERE TONIGHT.

2752
01:49:07,576 --> 01:49:09,578
AND, UH, JUST FOR THE RECORD

2753
01:49:09,779 --> 01:49:13,783
SHE DID NOT RUN OUT ON BARRY BECAUSE SHE HAD SYPHILIS.

2754
01:49:13,783 --> 01:49:15,384

2755
01:49:15,785 --> 01:49:16,986
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

2756
01:49:16,986 --> 01:49:18,187
I'M SERIOUS.

2757
01:49:19,789 --> 01:49:21,390
UH, THE REASON

2758
01:49:21,390 --> 01:49:23,392
SHE WALKED OUT ON... ON BARRY

2759
01:49:23,392 --> 01:49:26,996
IS SIMPLY THAT... SHE DIDN'T LOVE HIM

2760
01:49:26,996 --> 01:49:28,597
WHICH, INCIDENTALLY

2761
01:49:28,597 --> 01:49:30,599
WORKED OUT PRETTY WELL FOR ME.

2762
01:49:35,504 --> 01:49:37,506
UH...

2763
01:49:37,606 --> 01:49:39,208
SO, TO REVIEW...

2764
01:49:42,011 --> 01:49:46,415
RACHEL... TOOK A LOT OF COURAGE...

2765
01:49:46,415 --> 01:49:48,417
DOESN'T HAVE THE SYPHILIS...

2766
01:49:48,417 --> 01:49:50,619
AND...

2767
01:49:50,619 --> 01:49:53,823
WOUND UP WITH ME.

2768
01:49:53,823 --> 01:49:55,424
CHEERS.

2769
01:49:55,725 --> 01:49:58,527
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE PARKING LOT.

2770
01:49:58,928 --> 01:50:00,129
NO, RACH...

2771
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:04,834
AND ONCE AGAIN, SHE IS OUT OF HERE.

2772
01:50:05,134 --> 01:50:07,837
OKAY. WHO HAD 9:45? HMM?

2773
01:50:14,844 --> 01:50:16,445
HUH!

2774
01:50:16,445 --> 01:50:18,047

2775
01:50:21,250 --> 01:50:22,852
YOU KNOW WHAT, BAR?

2776
01:50:22,852 --> 01:50:24,353
I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE.

2777
01:50:24,353 --> 01:50:27,556
I PROBABLY SHOULD, BUT I'M NOT.

2778
01:50:27,556 --> 01:50:30,159
SEE, BECAUSE I PROMISED MYSELF I WOULD MAKE IT THROUGH

2779
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:32,161
AT LEAST ONE OF YOUR WEDDINGS.

2780
01:50:32,161 --> 01:50:33,462

2781
01:50:36,265 --> 01:50:39,869
SEE, NOW, TONIGHT, ALL I REALLY WANTED WAS TO MAKE IT

2782
01:50:40,269 --> 01:50:41,470
THROUGH THIS EVENING

2783
01:50:41,871 --> 01:50:44,673
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF GRACE AND DIGNITY.

2784
01:50:44,673 --> 01:50:49,078
WELL, I GUESS WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

2785
01:50:49,078 --> 01:50:49,979

2786
01:50:51,981 --> 01:50:55,584
I GUESS THERE'S NOTHING REALLY LEFT TO, UH, SAY...

2787
01:50:55,584 --> 01:50:57,586
EXCEPT, UM...

THEN KIDS IT IS.

2815
01:52:05,754 --> 01:52:07,356

SO, IF I HAVE TO DO IT ALL AGAIN, THEN I WILL.

I GUESS WE JUST...

01:54:18,587 --> 01:54:20,990
YEAH, BECAUSE LIFE'S JUST THAT KIND.

2858
01:54:21,390 --> 01:54:22,992
 CHANDLER, YOU GOT

2859
01:54:23,292 --> 01:54:24,893
TO STOP STARING AT THE DOOR.

2860
01:54:24,994 --> 01:54:26,195
IT'S LIKE A WATCHED POT.

2861
01:54:26,195 --> 01:54:27,796
YOU KNOW, IF YOU KEEP LOOKING AT IT

2862
01:54:27,796 --> 01:54:29,798
THEN THE DOOR IS NEVER GOING TO BOIL.

2863
01:54:29,798 --> 01:54:31,800
I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO

2864
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:33,702
IS TRY NOT TO...

2865
01:54:38,907 --> 01:54:41,710
OH, MY GOD.

2866
01:54:44,113 --> 01:54:45,314
OH...

2867
01:54:45,314 --> 01:54:47,716
MY...

2868
01:54:47,716 --> 01:54:49,318
GOD.

2869
01:54:57,926 --> 01:55:02,531
 OH... MY... GOD.

2870
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:13,642
ALL RIGHT, I'VE BEEN FEELING INCREDIBLY GUILTY ABOUT THIS

2871
01:55:14,043 --> 01:55:15,644
BECAUSE I WANT TO BE A GOOD FRIEND

2872
01:55:15,644 --> 01:55:16,845
AND DAMN IT, I AM A GOOD FRIEND.

2873
01:55:17,246 --> 01:55:18,847
SO JUST SHUT UP AND CLOSE YOUR EYES.

2874
01:55:18,847 --> 01:55:20,049
UH...

2875
01:55:22,951 --> 01:55:25,054
WOW.

2876
01:55:25,054 --> 01:55:26,655
YOU ARE A GOOD FRIEND.

2877
01:55:26,655 --> 01:55:27,856
OF COURSE

2878
01:55:27,856 --> 01:55:29,358
THE AUDITION WAS THIS MORNING

2879
01:55:29,358 --> 01:55:30,159
AND I DIDN'T GET IT.

2880
01:55:30,559 --> 01:55:32,261
BUT THAT WAS A HELL OF A KISS.

2881
01:55:32,661 --> 01:55:35,064
RACHEL IS A VERY LUCKY GIRL.
