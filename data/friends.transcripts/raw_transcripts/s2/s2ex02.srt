1
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:07,507
OKAY, THESE WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE

2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,110
AND I KNOW HE'S GOING TO GROW OUT OF THEM

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,612
IN, LIKE, 20 MINUTES, BUT I COULDN'T RESIST!

4
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,514

5
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:18,718
OH, LOOK AT THESE.

6
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:21,521
HEY, BEN, JUST DO IT.

7
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:22,822

8
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,424
OH, MY GOD.

9
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,427
OHH! OKAY, WAS THAT TOO MUCH PRESSURE FOR HIM?

10
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,029

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,630
WOW, IS HE HUNGRY ALREADY?

12
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,033
I GUESS SO.

13
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,634
YOU KNOW, IT'S...

14
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,638
SOMETHING FUNNY ABOUT SNEAKERS.

15
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:39,839
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

16
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,044
UH... UH... UH... I GOT TO GET ONE TOO.

17
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,048
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

18
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,850
WE'RE JUST HANGING OUT BY THE SPOONS

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,452
AND THE LADLE.

20
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,354
LOOK, WILL YOU GUYS GROW UP?

21
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,557
THIS IS THE MOST NATURAL, BEAUTIFUL THING IN THE WORLD.

22
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:01,261
YEAH, WE KNOW, BUT THERE'S A BABY SUCKING ON IT.

23
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,164
THIS IS MY SON HAVING LUNCH, OKAY?

24
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,166
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN A LOT

25
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,568
SO YOU BETTER GET USED TO IT.

26
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,470
IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH IT

27
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,872
IF YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE, ASK QUESTIONS.

28
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,074
CAROL'S FINE WITH IT.

29
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,975
COME ON.

30
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:17,977
CAROL?

31
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,979
CAROL?

32
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,981
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF JOEY

33
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,784
COULD ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT BREAST FEEDING.

34
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,288
SURE.

35
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,290
UH...

36
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,692
DOES IT HURT?

37
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:34,894
OH, IT DID AT FIRST, BUT NOT ANYMORE.

38
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,096
OH.

39
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,697
CHANDLER?

40
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:42,102
SO, UH... HOW OFTEN CAN YOU DO IT?

41
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,003
AS MUCH AS HE NEEDS.

42
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,406
OH, OH, OKAY, I GOT ONE.

43
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,607
I GOT ONE.

44
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,609
UH... IF HE BLOWS INTO ONE

45
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,611
DOES THE OTHER ONE GET BIGGER?

46
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,213
GET OUT. GET OUT.

60
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:42,962
RACHEL, ANY MUFFINS LEFT?

61
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,564
YEAH, I FORGET WHICH ONES.

62
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,665
OH, YOU'RE BUSY.

63
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,267
THAT'S OKAY. I'LL GET IT.

64
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,868
OH, ANYONE ELSE WANT ONE?

65
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,069
NO, THANKS.

66
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,071
OH, YOU'RE LOSING YOUR APRON HERE.

67
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,273
OH.

68
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,474
THERE YOU GO.

69
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,075
THANK YOU.

70
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,277

71
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,478
WHAT A BITCH.

72
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,983
I HAVE THIS FRIEND AT BLOOMINGDALE'S

73
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:07,587
WHO'S QUITTING TOMORROW AND WANTS TO ABUSE HIS DISCOUNT.

74
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,390
ANYONE WANT TO COME WITH ME AND TAKE ADVANTAGE...

75
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,193
I CAN'T. I'M TAKING MY GRANDMOTHER TO THE VET.

76
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:16,896
OKAY.

77
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,898
UM, I'LL GO WITH YOU.

78
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,099
GREAT.

79
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,102
HI, HONEY.

80
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,304
HEY, SWEETUMS.

81
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,706
AND HELLO TO THE REST.

82
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,108

83
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,512
MONICA, YOU CAN'T GO SHOPPING WITH HER.

84
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,113
WHAT ABOUT RACHEL?

85
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,916
THIS IS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM, ISN'T IT?

86
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,319
YOU'RE GOING TO BLOOMINGDALE'S WITH JULIE?

87
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,321
IT'S LIKE CHEATING ON RACHEL

88
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,922
IN HER HOUSE OF WORSHIP.

89
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,123
I JUST WANT TO...

90
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,926
MONICA, SHE WILL KILL YOU.

91
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,929
SHE WILL KILL YOU LIKE A DOG IN THE STREET.

92
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,535
SO, UH, JULES TELLS ME

93
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,937
YOU GUYS ARE GOING SHOPPING TOMORROW?

94
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:01,040
OH, YEAH, IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

95
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,042
WELL, IT'S A BIG DEAL TO ME.

96
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,644
THIS IS GREAT, MONICA.

97
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,946
I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS.

98
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,548
YOU'RE WELCOME.

99
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,450
WOOF! WOOF!

100
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,452

101
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,053

102
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,563
BIJAN FOR MEN?

103
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,164
BIJAN FOR MEN?

104
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,967
BIJAN FOR MEN?

105
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,769
HEY, ANNABEL.

106
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,371
HEY, JOEY.

107
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,972
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE NEW GUY?

108
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,374
WHO?

109
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,376
NOBODY KNOWS HIS NAME.

110
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,378
WE JUST CALL HIM THE "HOMBRE MAN."

111
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,880

112
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,388
HOMBRE?

113
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,195
WHAT'S HE DOING IN MY SECTION?

114
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,197
I GUESS HE DOESN'T KNOW.

115
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,199
WELL, HE'S GONNA.

116
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,602
I'LL SEE YOU A LITTLE LATER, OKAY?

117
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,407
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

118
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,809
MORNING.

119
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,012
LISTEN, UH, I KNOW YOU'RE NEW

120
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,815
BUT, UH, IT'S KIND OF UNDERSTOOD THAT EVERYTHING

121
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,017
FROM "YOUNG MEN'S" TO THE ESCALATOR

122
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,619
IS, UH, MY TERRITORY.

123
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,522
YOUR TERRITORY, HUH?

124
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,723
YEAH.

125
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,024
BIJAN FOR MEN?

126
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,626
NO, THANKS.

127
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,528
HOMBRE?

128
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,930
YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

129
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,438
YOU WERE SAYING?

130
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,643
PHOEBE, LISTEN, YOU WERE WITH ME

131
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,645
AND WE WERE SHOPPING ALL DAY.

132
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,246
WHAT?

133
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,748
WE WERE SHOPPING, AND WE HAD LUNCH.

134
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:50,550
WHAT DID I HAVE?

135
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,352
YOU HAD A SALAD.

136
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,555
OH, NO WONDER I DON'T FEEL FULL.

137
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:56,756
HI, GUYS. WHAT'S UP?

138
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:59,959
I WENT SHOPPING WITH MONICA ALL DAY

139
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,461
AND I HAD A SALAD.

140
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,062
GOOD, PHEEBS.

141
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,263
WHAT DID YOU BUY?

142
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,967
UM, WE WENT SHOPPING FOR, UM...

143
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,969
FOR, UM...

144
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,772
FOR FUR.

145
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,576
YOU WENT SHOPPING FOR FUR?

146
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,177
YEAH.

147
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,580
AND THEN I REALIZED THAT I'M AGAINST THAT

148
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,181
AND, UH...

149
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,584
SO THEN WE BOUGHT SOME, UM...

150
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,785
UM...

151
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:26,986
BOOBS.

152
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,791

153
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,793
YOU BOUGHT BOOBS?

154
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:37,897
BRAS!

155
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,600
WE BOUGHT BRAS!

156
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,903
WE BOUGHT BRAS.

157
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,007
BIJAN FOR MEN?

158
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,210
BIJAN FOR MEN?

159
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,412
BIJAN FOR M...

160
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,713
HEY, ANNABEL

161
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,215
LISTEN, I WAS WONDERING IF, AFTER WORK

162
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:59,419
YOU AND I COULD GO OUT AND GRAB A CUP OF COFFEE.

163
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,921
ACTUALLY, I SORT OF HAVE PLANS.

164
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,322
OH.

165
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,828
YOU READY, ANNABEL?

166
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,631
YOU BET.

167
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,834
MAYBE SOME OTHER TIME.

168
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,035
YEAH.

169
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,044
HEY, IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME

170
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:28,247
I LOST A GIRL TO A COWBOY SPRAYING COLOGNE.

171
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,350
BIJAN FOR MEN?

172
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:32,952
BIJAN FOR MEN?!

173
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,956
FUNNY CLOWN IS ONLY FOR AFTER HIS NAPS.

174
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,358
NOT BEFORE HIS NAPS

175
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,560
OR HE WON'T SLEEP.

176
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,562
CAROL, WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE.

177
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,163
WE HAVE A GOOD TIME.

178
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:45,465
WE LAUGH, WE PLAY.

179
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,867
IT'S LIKE WE'RE FATHER AND SON.

180
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,970
HONEY, RELAX.

181
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,572
ROSS IS GREAT WITH HIM.

182
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,574
DON'T LOOK SO SURPRISED.

183
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,576
I'M A LOVELY PERSON.

184
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,580
OH, THIS IS SO CUTE.

185
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,582
OH, I GOT THAT FOR HIM.

186
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,183
"MY MOMMIES LOVE ME."

187
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:08,988
THAT'S CLEVER.

188
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,189

189
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,190
HELLO?

190
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,192
OH, HI, JULES...

191
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,996
HI, JEW!

192
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,298
UH HUH.

193
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,900
UH HUH.

194
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,902
OKAY, UM, SURE. THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

195
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,004
SEE YOU THEN. BYE.

196
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,608
DID YOU JUST SAY, "HI, JEW"?

197
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,114
YES. UM, YES, I DID.

198
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,517
THAT WAS MY FRIEND EDDIE MOSKOWITZ.

199
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,423
HE'S GOING THROUGH THIS WHOLE RELIGIOUS THING.

200
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,226
YEAH, HE LIKES IT.

201
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,828
REAFFIRMS HIS FAITH.

202
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,436
BEN, DINNER!

203
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,337
THANKS, AUNT PHEEBS.

204
00:08:58,738 --> 00:08:59,939
HEY, YOU DIDN'T MICROWAVE THAT, DID YOU?

205
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,140
BECAUSE IT'S BREAST MILK

206
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,742
AND YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.

207
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:06,345
DUH, I THINK I KNOW HOW TO HEAT BREAST MILK.

208
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,148
OKAY.

209
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,551
WHAT DID YOU JUST DO?

210
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,553
I LICKED MY ARM. WHAT?

211
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,955
IT IT IT'S BREAST MILK.

212
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,557
SO?

213
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,760
PHOEBE, THAT IS JUICE SQUEEZED FROM A PERSON.

214
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,963
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?

215
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,565
NO. JOEY.

216
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,467
AAH! WHAT DID YOU JUST DO?

217
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,370
OKAY, CAN PEOPLE

218
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,273
STOP DRINKING THE BREAST MILK?

219
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,176
YOU WON'T EVEN TASTE IT?

220
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:38,377
NO.

221
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,780
NOT EVEN IF YOU JUST PRETEND THAT IT'S MILK.

222
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,381
NOT EVEN IF CAROL'S BREAST

223
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,383
HAD A PICTURE OF A MISSING CHILD ON IT.

224
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,391
HEY.

225
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,492
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

226
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,094
THEY TOOK BEN TO THE PARK.

227
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,696
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

228
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,497
JUST OUT.

229
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,499
HAD SOME LUNCH, JUST ME.

230
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,501
LITTLE QUALITY TIME WITH ME.

231
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,503
HEY, THANKS FOR YOUR JACKET.

232
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:05,705
OH, NO PROBLEM.

233
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,306
YOU CAN BORROW IT, BY THE WAY.

234
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,010
OH, HERE ARE YOUR KEYS, HON.

235
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,012
THANK YOU.

236
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,213
MON?

237
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,715
HMM?

238
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:19,518
IF, UH, YOU WERE AT LUNCH ALONE, HOW COME IT COST YOU $53?

239
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,724
YOU KNOW WHAT PROBABLY HAPPENED?

240
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,126
SOMEONE MUST HAVE STOLEN MY CREDIT CARD.

241
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,528
AND SORT OF JUST PUT THE RECEIPT

242
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,530
BACK IN YOUR POCKET?

243
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,432
HUH.

244
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,835
THAT IS AN EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT QUESTION.

245
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,837
THAT IS EXCELLENT.

246
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,338
MONICA, WHAT'S WITH YOU?

247
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,940
WHO DID YOU HAVE LUNCH WITH?

248
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,642
JUDY.

249
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,442
WHO?

250
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:43,943
JULIE.

251
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:44,844
WHAT?

252
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,746
JODY.

253
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,548
YOU WERE WITH JULIE?

254
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,350
LOOK. WHEN IT STARTED

255
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,153
I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE NICE TO HER

256
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,155
BECAUSE SHE WAS MY BROTHER'S GIRLFRIEND.

257
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,060
AND THEN, ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER

258
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,863
AND BEFORE I KNEW IT, WE WERE...

259
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,064
SHOPPING.

260
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,867
OH!

261
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,971
OH, MY GOD.

262
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,973
LOOK. HONEY, WAIT.

263
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,975
WE ONLY DID IT ONCE.

264
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,779
IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO ME.

265
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:20,780
YEAH.

266
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,981
YEAH, RIGHT.

267
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,282
REALLY.

268
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,884
SURE.

269
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,286
RACHEL, I WAS THINKING OF YOU THE WHOLE TIME.

270
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,288
YEAH, RIGHT.

271
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,290
LOOK. I'M SORRY, ALL RIGHT?

272
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,392
I NEVER MEANT FOR YOU TO FIND OUT.

273
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,794
OH, PLEASE!

274
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,196
PLEASE! YOU WANTED TO GET CAUGHT!

275
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,798
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

276
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,600
OH, SO YOU JUST SORT OF HAPPENED TO LEAVE IT IN HERE?

277
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,404
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT I MIGHT JUST BE THAT STUPID?

278
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:50,409
OKAY, MONICA, I JUST HAVE TO KNOW ONE THING.

279
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,212

280
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,415
DID YOU GO WITH HER TO BLOOMINGDALE'S?

281
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,220
OHH!

282
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,426
OKAY.

283
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,028
OKAY.

284
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,629
OKAY, I JUST REALLY, UH...

285
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,233
I JUST REALLY NEED TO NOT BE WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

286
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,237

287
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,344
YEAH, HI.

288
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,545
WHO'S THIS?

289
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:27,546
HI, JOANNE.

290
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,148
IS RACHEL WORKING?

291
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,750
IT'S MONICA.

292
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,552
YES, I KNOW I DID A HORRIBLE THING.

293
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,454
JOANNE, IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE

294
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:36,655
AS ALL THAT, OKAY?

295
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,859
NO, I DON'T CARE WHAT STEVE THINKS.

296
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,060
HI, STEVE.

297
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,661

298
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,264
HEY. HEY.

299
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,266
HI.

300
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,367
HOW DID WE DO?

301
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,570
OH, I TASTED BEN'S MILK AND ROSS FREAKED OUT.

302
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,372
I DID NOT FREAK OUT.

303
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,673
WHY'D YOU FREAK OUT?

304
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,475
BECAUSE IT'S BREAST MILK.

305
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,276
IT IT...

306
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:58,878
IT'S GROSS.

307
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,580
MY BREAST MILK IS GROSS?

308
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,683
THIS SHOULD BE FUN.

309
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,287
NO. NO, CAROL.

310
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,889
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.

311
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,691
I JUST DON'T THINK BREAST MILK IS FOR ADULTS.

312
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,494
OF COURSE, THE PACKAGING DOES APPEAL TO GROWNUPS

313
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:16,295
AND KIDS ALIKE.

314
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,697
ROSS, YOU'RE BEING SILLY.

315
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:19,899
I'VE TRIED IT.

316
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,100
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

317
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,701
COME ON, JUST TASTE IT.

318
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,303

319
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,504
THAT WOULD BE "NO."

320
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,107
COME ON. COME ON, TRY IT.

321
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:29,308
NO.

322
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,910
IT DOESN'T TASTE BAD.

323
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,912
YEAH. IT TASTES KIND OF SWEET--

324
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,113
SORT OF LIKE, UH...

325
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:34,914
LIKE WHAT?

326
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,215
CANTALOUPE JUICE.

327
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,317
EXACTLY.

328
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,826
YOU'VE TASTED IT.

329
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,828
YOU'VE YOU'VE YOU'VE TASTED IT?

330
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,429
UH HUH.

331
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,331
OH, YOU'VE TASTED IT.

332
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:58,037
YOU CAN KEEP SAYING IT, BUT IT WON'T STOP BEING TRUE.

333
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,346
GET ME THE BOTTLE.

334
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,054
GET ME THE TOWEL.

335
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,480
HOWDY.

336
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,883
GET ME A BOX OF JUICE.

337
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,788
WELL, THEY SWITCHED ME OVER TO HOMBRE.

338
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,790
WELL, MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE OF THE WAY

339
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,992
YOU'RE DRESSED.

340
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,193
OR MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE

341
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,794
THIS GUY'S DOING SO GOOD

342
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:58,197
THEY WANT TO PUT MORE PEOPLE ON IT.

343
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,499
YOU SHOULD SEE THIS GUY, CHANDLER.

344
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,202
HE GOES THROUGH, LIKE, TWO BOTTLES A DAY NOW.

345
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,803
SO WHAT DO YOU CARE?

346
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,405
YOU'RE AN ACTOR.

347
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,606
THIS IS YOUR DAY JOB.

348
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,809
THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU.

349
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,212
I KNOW, BUT I WAS THE BEST, YOU KNOW?

350
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,214
I LIKED BEING THE BEST.

351
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:20,819
I DON'T KNOW.

352
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,222
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST GET OUT OF THE GAME.

353
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,025
THEY NEED GUYS UP IN HOUSEWARES TO SERVE CHEESE.

354
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,626
ALL RIGHT, SAY YOU DO THAT.

355
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,829
SOONER OR LATER, SOMEBODY'S GOING TO COME ALONG

356
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,631
THAT SLICES A BETTER CHEDDAR

357
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:33,432
AND THEN

358
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,434
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO RUN?

359
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:36,335
YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

360
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:37,937
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I'M RIGHT.

361
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,939
I SAY YOU SHOW THIS GUY WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF.

362
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,540
I SAY YOU STAND YOUR GROUND.

363
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,741
I SAY YOU SHOW HIM THAT YOU ARE

364
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,743
THE BADDEST HOMBRE WEST OF THE LINGERIE.

365
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,345
I'M GOING TO DO IT.

366
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:47,546
ALL RIGHT.

367
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,148
NOW GO SEE MISS KITTY

368
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,951
AND SHE'LL FIX YOU UP WITH A NICE HOOKER.

369
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,055
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY.

370
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,656
OH, WELL, THAT WORKS OUT GOOD

371
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:58,857
BECAUSE I'M NOT LISTENING.

372
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,560
I FEEL TERRIBLE. I REALLY DO.

373
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,163
OH, I'M SORRY. DID MY BACK HURT YOUR KNIFE?

374
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,364
RACHEL...

375
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,866
RACHEL, SAY THAT I'M FRIENDS WITH HER.

376
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,868
WE SPEND SOME TIME TOGETHER.

377
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,070
IS THAT SO TERRIBLE?

378
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:11,770
YES.

379
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,871
IT'S THAT TERRIBLE?

380
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,773
YES, MONICA. YOU DON'T GET IT.

381
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,775
IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT SHE STOLE THE GUY

382
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,779
WHO MIGHT ACTUALLY BE THE PERSON THAT I AM SUPPOSED TO BE WITH

383
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:21,780
BUT NOW...

384
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,782
SHE'S ACTUALLY...

385
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:27,386
BUT NOW SHE'S ACTUALLY STEALING YOU.

386
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:29,488
ME?

387
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,791
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

388
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,393
NOBODY COULD STEAL ME FROM YOU.

389
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,795
I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE I'M FRIENDS WITH HER

390
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:39,198
DOESN'T MAKE ME ANY LESS FRIENDS WITH YOU.

391
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,599
I MEAN...

392
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,701
I MEAN, YOU'RE MY...

393
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,405
WE'RE...

394
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,507

395
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,109
OH, I LOVE YOU.

396
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,810
I LOVE YOU TOO.

397
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,912

398
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,016
YOU GUYS, UM...

399
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,018
I KNOW THAT THIS REALLY DOESN'T HAVE

400
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,619
ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME

401
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,022
BUT, UM... I LOVE YOU GUYS TOO.

402
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,124
OH, PHOEBE, WE LOVE YOU TOO.

403
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,729
OH, I REALLY NEEDED THAT.

404
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:15,634
LOOK, I KNOW THAT YOU'RE IN A PLACE RIGHT NOW

405
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:18,437
WHERE YOU REALLY NEED TO HATE JULIE'S GUTS

406
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,839
BUT... SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

407
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,143
I MEAN, SHE'S JUST A GIRL WHO MET A GUY

408
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,744
AND NOW THEY GO OUT.

409
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:29,148
AND I REALLY THINK THAT IF YOU GAVE HER A CHANCE

410
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,150
YOU'D LIKE HER.

411
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,552
WILL YOU JUST GIVE THAT A CHANCE?

412
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,953
FOR ME?

413
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:38,957
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.

414
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,159
YOU KNOW THAT.

415
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,761
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR YOU!

416
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:43,962
I KNOW.

417
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,564
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

418
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,284
MORNING.

419
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:11,590
I SAID MORNING.

420
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,292
I HEARD YOU.

421
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,494
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.

422
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,996
I'M OPENING THE DOORS.

423
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,598
YOU BOYS READY?

424
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:25,704
READY.

425
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,006
YEAH, I'M READY.

426
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,451

427
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,154
YOU IDIOT!

428
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,755
YOU STUPID COWBOY!

429
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,357
YOU BLINDED ME!

430
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,558
I'M SUING!

431
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,960
OH, MY GOD! TODD, WHAT THE HELL

432
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,961
DID YOU DO?!

433
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,063
I'M SORRY. I'M SUCH A DUFUS.

434
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,265
I'M SO SORRY.

435
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,866
I'M SO SORRY.

436
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:31,470
MY GOD. WHAT HAPPENED?

437
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,872
AH, THESE NEW KIDS, THEY NEVER LAST.

438
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,675
SOONER OR LATER, THEY ALL...

439
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,077
STOP LASTING.

440
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,679
LISTEN, UH...

441
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,682
WHAT DO YOU SAY I BUY YOU THAT CUP OF COFFEE NOW?

442
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,684
SURE.

443
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,097
SO...

444
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,299
SO...

445
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:05,103
I JUST THOUGHT THE TWO OF US SHOULD HANG OUT FOR A BIT.

446
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,506
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WE'VE NEVER REALLY TALKED.

447
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:11,610
I GUESS YOU'D KNOW THAT, BEING ONE OF THE TWO OF US

448
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,212
RIGHT?

449
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,413
NO, I KNOW.

450
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:18,016
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T EVEN TELL YOU THIS

451
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,618
BUT I'M PRETTY MUCH

452
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,421
TOTALLY INTIMIDATED BY YOU.

453
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:25,224
REALLY? ME?

454
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,425
OH, MY GOD.

455
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,626
ARE YOU KIDDING?

456
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,628
ROSS IS SO CRAZY ABOUT YOU

457
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,030
AND I REALLY WANTED YOU TO LIKE ME

458
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,232
AND I, UH...

459
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,335
IT'S PROBABLY ME JUST BEING TOTALLY PARANOID

460
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,337
BUT I KIND OF GOT THE FEELING

461
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,938
THAT MAYBE YOU DON'T.

462
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,147
WELL...

463
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,149
YOU'RE NOT TOTALLY PARANOID.

464
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,552
OY.

465
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,153
UM...

466
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:59,157
OKAY. UM...

467
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,759
OH, GOD.

468
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,161
UM...

469
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:07,165
WHEN YOU AND ROSS FIRST STARTED GOING OUT

470
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:11,169
IT WAS REALLY HARD FOR ME, UM...

471
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,771
FOR MANY REASONS

472
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,974
OF WHICH I'M NOT GOING TO BORE YOU WITH NOW

473
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,175
BUT, UM...

474
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:22,881
I JUST... I SEE HOW HAPPY HE IS, YOU KNOW

475
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:26,084
AND HOW GOOD YOU GUYS ARE TOGETHER

476
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,286
AND, UM...

477
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,088
MONICA'S ALWAYS SAYING HOW NICE YOU ARE

478
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,090
AND GOD, I HATE IT WHEN SHE'S RIGHT.

479
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,294
THANKS.

480
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,495
YEAH.

481
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,696
HEY, LISTEN...

482
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,899
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TO A MOVIE SOMETIME OR SOMETHING?

483
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,701
YEAH. THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

484
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:43,902
YEAH? I'D LOVE IT.

485
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,103
I'D LOVE IT TOO.

486
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:45,904
OKAY.

487
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,105
OKAY.

488
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,307
OH, SHOOT. I GOT TO GO.

489
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,309
SO I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, OKAY?

490
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,109
ALL RIGHT, JULIE.

491
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,311
BYE.

492
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,512
BYE.

493
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,721
WHAT A MANIPULATIVE BITCH.

494
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,434

495
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,653
NOT BAD.
