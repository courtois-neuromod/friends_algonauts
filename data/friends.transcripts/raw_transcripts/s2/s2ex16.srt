1
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:04,504
MAN, THIS IS WEIRD.

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,705
YOU EVER REALIZE

3
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:08,108
CAP'N CRUNCH'S EYEBROWS ARE ACTUALLY ON HIS HAT?

4
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:09,509
THAT'S WHAT'S WEIRD?

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,312
JOEY, THE MAN'S BEEN CAPTAIN OF A CEREAL

6
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:13,913
FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS.

7
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:16,316
BAH! LAH!

8
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:17,517
WHAT?

9
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,718
THE SPOON.

10
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,720
YOU LICKED AND AND YOU PUT.

11
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,124
YOU LICKED AND YOU PUT.

12
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,426
YEAH? SO?

13
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,028
WELL, DON'T YOU SEE HOW GROSS THAT IS?

14
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,430
I MEAN, THAT'S LIKE YOU'RE USING MY TOOTHBRUSH.

15
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,433
YOU USED MY TOOTHBRUSH?

16
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,636
WELL, THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE I USED THE RED ONE

17
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:37,837
TO UNCLOG THE DRAIN.

18
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,441
MINE IS THE RED ONE!

19
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,643
OH, GOD.

20
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,245
CAN OPEN.

21
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,048
WORMS EVERYWHERE.

22
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,750
HEY, WHY CAN'T WE USE THE SAME TOOTHBRUSH

23
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,752
BUT WE CAN USE THE SAME SOAP?

24
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:55,155
BECAUSE SOAP IS SOAP.

25
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,756
IT'S SELF CLEANING.

26
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:59,559
ALL RIGHT, WELL, NEXT TIME YOU TAKE A SHOWER

27
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,961
THINK ABOUT THE LAST THING I WASH

28
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,563
AND THE FIRST THING YOU WASH.

42
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,012
HEY.

43
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,013
HEY. HEY.

44
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,816
OOH, LOOK AT YOU FANCY LADS.

45
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,818
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

46
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:02,822
WELL, YOU KNOW THE GUY ON MY SHOW THAT'S IN A COMA?

47
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,225
HE'S HAVING A BRUNCH.

48
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,227
HEY. READY WHEN YOU ARE.

49
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,828
OKEY DOKE.

50
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,029
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS

51
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,631
ARE ACTUALLY GETTING TATTOOS.

52
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,633
EXCUSE ME. YOU GUYS ARE GETTING TATTOOS?

53
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,235
YES, BUT YOU CANNOT TELL ROSS

54
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,836
BECAUSE I WANT TO SURPRISE HIM.

55
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,438
WOW. THIS IS WILD.

56
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,240
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GET?

57
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,642
UM, I'M GETTING A LILY.

58
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:26,646
FOR MY MOM, BECAUSE HER NAME'S LILY.

59
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,847
WOW. THAT'S LUCKY.

60
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,650
WHAT IF HER NAME WAS "BIG UGLY SPLOTCH"?

61
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,752
SO WHERE YOU GETTING IT?

62
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,354
I THINK ON MY SHOULDER.

63
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,655
WHAT?

64
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,257
WHAT'S ON YOUR SHOULDER?

65
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,259
UM, A CHIP.

66
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,164
I'VE GOT A BIG ATTITUDE PROBLEM.

67
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,367
A TATTOO. I'M GETTING A TATTOO.

68
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,568
A TATTOO?

69
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,970
WHY? WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

70
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,172
HI.

71
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,373
HI.

72
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,375
WELL, HEY, YOU DON'T THINK THEY'RE KIND OF COOL?

73
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,976
NO. SORRY. I DON'T.

74
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,978
I MEAN, WHY WOULD ANYONE PAY SOMEONE

75
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,580
TO SCAR THEIR BODY FOR LIFE?

76
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,283
AND WHAT IF IT DOESN'T COME OUT RIGHT, PHEEBS?

77
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,685
IT'S LIKE HAVING A BAD HAIRCUT ALL THE TIME.

78
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,087
WHY IS EVERYONE STARING AT ME?

79
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,890
ROSS, COME SIGN THIS BIRTHDAY CARD FOR DAD.

80
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,293
RICHARD'S GOING TO BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

81
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,395
OOH, RICH IS GOING TO THE PARTY, TOO, HUH?

82
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,596
WELL, HE'S MY PARENTS' BEST FRIEND.

83
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:17,797
HE HAS TO BE THERE.

84
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,199
SO, IS TODAY THE DAY

85
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,501
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL THEM ABOUT YOU TWO?

86
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:25,805
YEAH, FOR MY DAD'S BIRTHDAY, I DECIDED TO GIVE HIM A STROKE.

87
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:29,008
YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU SHOULD TELL THEM.

88
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,610
NO. I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW SERIOUS HE IS ABOUT ME.

89
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,612
UNTIL I DO, I'M NOT TELLING THEM ANYTHING.

90
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,114
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T THINK MOM AND DAD WOULD MIND.

91
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,116
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE NINE, AND RICHARD WAS 30

92
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:39,919
HOW DAD USED TO SAY, "GOD, I HOPE THEY GET TOGETHER"?

93
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,523

94
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,726
HELLO?

95
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,927
 It's me. I'm double parked.

96
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,529
OKAY. COME ON, ROSS. BYE, GUYS.

97
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,030
SEE YOU. SEE YOU.

98
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,232
 OKAY.

99
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,833
OH, BYE, YOU.

100
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,435
BYE.

101
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,638

102
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,640
HMM.

103
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,841
BYE, YOU.

104
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,953
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

105
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,955
HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO.

106
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,557
OKAY, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

107
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,959
IT'S GOING TO BE FINE.

108
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,160
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

109
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,362
ARE YOU NOT NERVOUS?

110
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,563
I'M TERRIFIED.

111
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,965
THIS IS JUST A VERY ABSORBENT SUIT.

112
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,166
ALL RIGHT, SHALL WE, MONICA?

113
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,368
YES, YES.

114
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,569
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?

115
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:30,770
ROSS, LET'S LET'S SWITCH PLACES.

116
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,971
YOU GET IN THE MIDDLE.

117
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,172
OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT?

118
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,174
UNLESS THIS LOOKS LIKE WE'RE TRYING

119
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:36,776
TO COVER SOMETHING UP.

120
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,979
MONICA, MONICA, YOU COULD COME IN STRADDLING HIM.

121
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,481
THEY STILL WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

122
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:44,684
WE'RE HERE.

123
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,185
OH, HI, KIDS.

124
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,387
HI, DARLING.

125
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,389
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DAD.

126
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,990
OH, THANK YOU.

127
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,191
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

128
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,994
SO, YOU KIDS THANK DR. BURKE FOR THE RIDE?

129
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,195
UH, ACTUALLY, MOM

130
00:04:56,195 --> 00:05:00,600
I THINK MONICA THANKED HIM FOR THE BOTH OF US.

131
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,602
SO, YOU KIDS TAKE THE TRAIN IN?

132
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,604
NO. RICHARD BURKE GAVE THEM A RIDE.

133
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,606
OH. SPEAKING OF WHOM...

134
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,008
I HEAR HE'S GOT SOME 20 YEAR OLD TWINKIE

135
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:09,809
IN THE CITY.

136
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,312
 OH, HONEY!

137
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,615
FINGER CRAMP.

138
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,816
OH, GOD.

139
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,117
SORRY.

140
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:19,719
HERE. LET ME GET THAT, MOM.

141
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:23,323
SO, RICHARD'S SHOPPING IN THE JUNIOR SECTION.

142
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,524
MM HMM.

143
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,526
ARE WE STILL ON THAT?

144
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,729
AND YOU JUST KNOW SHE'S GOT THE I.Q. OF A NAPKIN.

145
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,331
MM HMM.

146
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,032
SHE'S PROBABLY NOT EVEN VERY PRETTY-

147
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,835
JUST YOUNG ENOUGH SO THAT EVERYTHING IS STILL POINTING UP.

148
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,145
 CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS PLACE?

149
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,747
I KNOW. THIS IS A GREAT APARTMENT.

150
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,349
OH! I WAS JUST IN THE BATHROOM

151
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,351
AND THERE'S MIRRORS ON BOTH SIDES OF YOU.

152
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,552
SO WHEN YOU'RE IN THERE

153
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,954
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE PEEING WITH THE ROCKETTES.

154
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:58,157
WELL, THERE'S MY FANTASY COME TRUE.

155
00:05:58,157 --> 00:05:59,359
NO, SERIOUSLY.

156
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,761
HEY.

157
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,364
HEY. WE WERE JUST SAYING, GREAT APARTMENT, MAN.

158
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,965
THANKS. YOU WANT IT? HUH?

159
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,967
YEAH, I'M MOVING TO A BIGGER PLACE.

160
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,969
YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY TAKE THIS ONE.

161
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,372
YEAH. CAN YOU SEE ME IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

162
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,274
WHY NOT? YOU HATE PARK VIEWS AND HIGH CEILINGS?

163
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,276
COME ON. I'LL SHOW YOU THE KITCHEN.

164
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,278

165
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,180
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT, FELLAS.

166
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,182
I SAW A KITCHEN THIS MORNING... ON TV.

167
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:27,186
STOP TALKING. OKAY.

168
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,388
COME ON, TELL US.

169
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,989
YEAH, IS SHE REALLY 2O?

170
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,991
I AM NOT TELLING YOU GUYS ANYTHING.

171
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,593
COME ON, RICH, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

172
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,194
LET ME LIVE VICARIOUSLY.

173
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,397
DAD, YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

174
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,799
AH, WHAT'S A LITTLE MIDLIFE CRISIS BETWEEN FRIENDS?

175
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,602
JACK, WOULD YOU LET IT GO?

176
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,203
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

177
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,805
WHEN I TURNED 50, I GOT THE PORSCHE.

178
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:49,409
YOU, YOU GOT YOUR OWN LITTLE SPEEDSTER.

179
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,110
GUYS, SERIOUSLY, IT IS NOT LIKE THAT.

180
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,311
TELL YOU WHAT.

181
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,313
MAYBE, ONE OF THESE WEEKENDS

182
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,716
YOU CAN BORROW THE CAR, AND I COULD...

183
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,118
DAD, I BEG YOU NOT TO FINISH THAT SENTENCE.

184
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,720
WHAT? I'M KIDDING.

185
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,724
YOU KNOW I'D NEVER LET HIM TOUCH THE PORSCHE.

186
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,932
OKAY, RACH

187
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,934
WHICH... WHICH LILY?

188
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,936
THIS LILY OR THAT LILY?

189
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,237
WELL, I... I LIKE THIS LILY.

190
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,239
IT'S MORE OPEN, YOU KNOW?

191
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,841
AND THAT'S LIKE MY MOM--

192
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:25,445
SHE HAD A MORE OPEN, GIVING SPIRIT.

193
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,947
OOH, FOGHORN LEGHORN! OH...

194
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:28,948
ALL RIGHT.

195
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,350
BLOND GIRL, YOU'RE IN ROOM TWO.

196
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,753
NOT SO BLOND GIRL, YOU'RE WITH ME.

197
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,455
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

198
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,656
UH HUH.

199
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,658
YOU'RE NOT GOING?

200
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,259
UH HUH.

201
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,462
WHAT, IS IT... IS THIS BECAUSE OF WHAT ROSS SAID?

202
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,663
NO.

203
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,665
WELL, YEAH, MAYBE.

204
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,667
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

205
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,069
IS THIS HOW THIS RELATIONSHIP'S GOING TO WORK?

206
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,270
ROSS EQUALS BOSS?

207
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,672
I MEAN...

208
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,174
COME ON, WHAT IS THIS- 1922?

209
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,176
WHAT'S 1922?

210
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,979
JUST, YOU KNOW, A LONG TIME AGO.

211
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,883
WELL, WHEN MEN USED TO TELL WOMEN WHAT TO DO A LOT.

212
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,785
AND THEN THERE WAS SUFFRAGE

213
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,988
WHICH WAS A GOOD THING, BUT IT SOUNDS HORRIBLE.

214
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,691

215
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,693
DO YOU WANT TO GET THIS TATTOO?

216
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:16,095
YES, I DO. IT'S JUST THAT ROSS...

217
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:16,896
OKAY, HEY, HEY!

218
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,898
IS YOUR BOYFRIEND THE BOSS OF YOU?

219
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,101
NO.

220
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,703
OKAY, WHO IS THE BOSS OF YOU?

221
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,506
YOU?

222
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,109
NO. YOU ARE THE BOSS OF YOU.

223
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,711
NOW, YOU MARCH YOUR HEINIE IN THERE

224
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,312
AND GET THAT HEART TATTOOED ON YOUR HIP.

225
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,113
GO!

226
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,219
I HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN MY TATTOO YET

227
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,821
AND I'M ALREADY TOUGHER.

228
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,427
HOW YOU DOING?

229
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,429
I'M A TWINKIE.

230
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,633
REALLY? I'M A HERO.

231
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,234
OH...

232
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,435
AH...

233
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:57,637
THIS IS SO HARD.

234
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,238
YEAH, I KNOW.

235
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,439
I HATE IT, TOO.

236
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,242
LOOK, MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST TELL THEM.

237
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,445
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST TELL YOUR PARENTS FIRST.

238
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:09,649
MY PARENTS ARE DEAD.

239
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,251
GOD, YOU ARE SO LUCKY.

240
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,853
NO, NO.

241
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,855
I MEAN, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

242
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,456
I KNOW. I KNOW.

243
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,859
JUST HANG IN THERE, OKAY?

244
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,662
OKAY, I'LL GO OUT FIRST, ALL RIGHT?

245
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,263
ALL RIGHT.

246
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,269
JUDY. GOING TO THE BATHROOM!

247
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,470
GOOD FOR YOU!

248
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,875
THANK YOU, RICHARD.

249
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,277
I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT.

250
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,482
HONEY, HAVE YOU SEEN

251
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,484
MY HARMON KILL EBREW BAT?

252
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,887
BOB DOESN'T BELIEVE I HAVE ONE.

253
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,088
I HAVE NO IDEA.

254
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,291
DID YOU KNOW RICHARD HAS A TWINKIE IN THE CITY?

255
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,693
I KNOW. HE'S LIKE A NEW MAN.

256
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,195
IT'S LIKE A SCENE FROM COCOON.

257
00:09:56,195 --> 00:10:01,400
I JUST NEVER WOULD HAVE PICTURED RICHARD WITH A BIMBO.

258
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,604
APPARENTLY, HE TOLD JOHNNY SHAPIRO THAT SHE'S QUITE A GIRL.

259
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,805
IN FACT, HE TOLD JOHNNY

260
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,807
THAT HE THINKS HE'S FALLING IN LOVE WITH HER.

261
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,008
REALLY?

262
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,010
I TELL YOU, I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM THIS HAPPY.

263
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,112
SO, JACK, YOU EVER THINK

264
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,915
ABOUT TRADING ME IN FOR A YOUNGER MODEL?

265
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,116
OF COURSE NOT.

266
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:21,120
WITH YOU, IT'S LIKE I'VE GOT TWO 25 YEAR OLDS.

267
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,726
OH, JACK, STOP.

268
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,728
COME ON.

269
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:32,732
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

270
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,534

271
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,236
CAN WE DROP THIS?

272
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:40,439
I AM NOT INTERESTED IN THE GUY'S APARTMENT.

273
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,540
OH, PLEASE.

274
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,744
I SAW THE WAY YOU WERE CHECKING OUT HIS MOLDINGS.

275
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:45,945
YOU WANT IT.

276
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,347
WHY WOULD I WANT ANOTHER APARTMENT? HUH?

277
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,750
I'VE ALREADY GOT AN APARTMENT THAT I LOVE.

278
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,052
WELL, IT WOULDN'T KILL YOU TO SAY IT

279
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,654
ONCE IN A WHILE.

280
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,058
ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT THE TRUTH?

281
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,660
I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.

282
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,261
WHAT?

283
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,263
I'M SORRY. I'M 28 YEARS OLD.

284
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,865
I'VE NEVER LIVED ALONE

285
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:09,468
AND I'M FINALLY AT A PLACE WHERE I GOT ENOUGH MONEY

286
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,871
THAT I DON'T NEED A ROOMMATE ANYMORE.

287
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,172
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

288
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,174
I DON'T NEED A ROOMMATE EITHER, OKAY?

289
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,977
I CAN AFFORD TO LIVE HERE BY MYSELF.

290
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,980
YOU KNOW, I MAY HAVE TO BRING IN SOMEBODY ONCE A WEEK

291
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,381
TO LICK THE SILVERWARE.

292
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,584
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING SO BENT OUT OF SHAPE FOR, HUH?

293
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,387
IT'S NOT LIKE WE AGREED TO LIVE TOGETHER FOREVER.

294
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:29,588
WE'RE NOT BERT AND ERNIE.

295
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:34,694
I'M AWARE THAT WE'RE NOT GAY PUPPETS, ALL RIGHT?

296
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,797
LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

297
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,799
IF THIS IS THE WAY YOU FEEL

298
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,400
THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE IT.

299
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,002
WELL, THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

300
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,004
THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE IT.

301
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,105
WELL, THEN MAYBE I WILL!

302
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:46,906
FINE WITH ME.

303
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:47,506
GREAT.

304
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,208
THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE

305
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,810
TO SPEND MORE QUALITY TIME

306
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,212
WITH YOUR REAL FRIENDS-- THE SPOONS.

307
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,415
WHOSE DRINK CAN I FRESHEN?

308
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,818
ALMOST TIME FOR CAKE.

309
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,228
MON? :   YEAH?

310
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:10,830
MON, ARE YOU OKAY?

311
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,834
YOU REMEMBER THAT VIDEO I FOUND OF MOM AND DAD?

312
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,035
YEAH?

313
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,636
WELL, I JUST CAUGHT THE LIVE SHOW.

314
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,638
EWW.

315
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,444
HEY, THERE.

316
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,645
WHAT?

317
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:27,546
NOTHING.

318
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:28,748
I JUST...

319
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,150
HEARD SOMETHING NICE ABOUT YOU.

320
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,551
OH, REALLY?

321
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:33,753
MM HMM.

322
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,954
 RICHARD?

323
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:35,855
RICHARD...

324
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,257
YOUR SON ISN'T SEEING ANYONE, IS HE?

325
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,859
UH, NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

326
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,060
WELL, I WAS THINKING

327
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,462
WHY DOESN'T HE GIVE MONICA A CALL?

328
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:46,665
THAT...

329
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,667
THAT'S AN IDEA.

330
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:52,271
WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M ALREADY SEEING SOMEONE.

331
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,072
OH?

332
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,273
OH?

333
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,074
OH...

334
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,076

335
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,078
SHE NEVER TELLS US ANYTHING.

336
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:02,281
ROSS, DID YOU KNOW MONICA'S SEEING SOMEONE?

337
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,484
MOM, THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE IN MY LIFE.

338
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,486
SOME OF THEM ARE SEEING PEOPLE

339
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,488
AND SOME OF THEM AREN'T.

340
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:10,689
IS THAT CRYSTAL?

341
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,494
SO, WHO'S THE MYSTERY MAN?

342
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,697
WELL, UH, HE'S A DOCTOR.

343
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,199
ARE AL DOCTOR?

344
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,002
NO, A DOCTOR OF MEAT.

345
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,704
OF COURSE HE'S A REAL DOCTOR.

346
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,306
AND HE'S HANDSOME...

347
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,507
AND HE'S SWEET

348
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,910
AND I KNOW YOU'D LIKE HIM.

349
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,312
WELL, THAT'S WONDERFUL. I...

350
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,416
OY.

351
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,320
MOM, IT'S OKAY.

352
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,521
IT IS, JUDY.

353
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,523
JACK...

354
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,028
COULD YOU COME IN HERE FOR A MOMENT?

355
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,229
NOW!

356
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,831
FOUND IT.

357
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,833
I'LL TAKE THAT, DAD.

358
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,939
IT SEEMS YOUR DAUGHTER AND RICHARD

359
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,941
ARE SOMETHING OF AN ITEM.

360
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,542
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

361
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:06,345
HE'S GOT A TWINKIE IN THE CITY.

362
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,347
DAD, I'M THE TWINKIE.

363
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,949
YOU'RE THE TWINKIE?

364
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,150
SHE'S NOT A TWINKIE.

365
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,751
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, YOU GUYS

366
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:15,554
THIS IS THE BEST RELATIONSHIP I'VE BEEN IN...

367
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,556
OH, PLEASE! A RELATIONSHIP?

368
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:18,858
YES, A RELATIONSHIP.

369
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,660
FOR YOUR INFORMATION, I AM CRAZY ABOUT THIS MAN.

370
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,461
REALLY?

371
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:23,662
YES.

372
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:24,864
WOW.

373
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,265
AM I SUPPOSED TO STAND HERE

374
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,267
AND LISTEN TO THIS ON MY BIRTHDAY?

375
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,169
DAD... DAD, THIS IS A GOOD THING FOR ME.

376
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,171
YOU KNOW, AND YOU EVEN SAID YOURSELF

377
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,772
YOU'D NEVER SEEN RICHARD HAPPIER.

378
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:34,773
WHEN DID I SAY THAT?

379
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,275
UPSTAIRS IN THE BATHROOM

380
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,877
RIGHT BEFORE YOU FELT UP MOM.

381
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:42,081

382
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,784

383
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:50,189

384
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:55,494
? HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU. ?

385
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,495

386
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,697
OH, IT LOOKS SO GOOD.

387
00:14:58,697 --> 00:14:59,899
OH, I LOVE IT.

388
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,100
I KNOW. SO DO I.

389
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,102
I'M SO GLAD YOU MADE ME DO THIS.

390
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,703
OKAY, LET ME SEE YOURS.

391
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,206
UH...

392
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:10,809
OKAY, LET'S SEE YOURS AGAIN.

393
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,112
PHOEBE, WE JUST SAW MINE. LET ME SEE YOURS.

394
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,713
OH, OKAY.

395
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,717
OH, NO!

396
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,719
OH, IT'S GONE.

397
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:21,921
THAT'S SO WEIRD.

398
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:26,025
I DON'T KNOW HOW... WHERE IT WENT.

399
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,027
YOU DIDN'T GET IT?

400
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,628
NO.

401
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,230
WHY DIDN'T YOU GET IT?

402
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,831
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

403
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,733
PHOEBE, HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?!

404
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:35,935
THIS WAS ALL YOUR IDEA.

405
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,337
I KNOW, I KNOW, AND I WAS GOING TO GET IT

406
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,039
BUT THEN HE CAME IN WITH THIS NEEDLE.

407
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,342
DID YOU KNOW THEY DO THIS WITH NEEDLES?

408
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,344
REALLY? YOU DON'T SAY?

409
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:49,348
BECAUSE MINE WAS LICKED ON BY KITTENS!

410
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,549
I'M SORRY. I...

411
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,551
ALL RIGHT, SERIOUSLY... SERIOUSLY

412
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,752
DOES IT HURT A LOT?

413
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,254
NO. IT'S JUST LIKE A PINCH. LIKE THAT.

414
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,855
OW! OH! OW! OH, MY GOD!

415
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:58,457
OH, THAT'S...

416
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,459
OH, THAT REALLY HURT ME!

417
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,861
OH, THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE A MARK.

418
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,265
HEY.

419
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,466
HEY.

420
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,468
HEY, LISTEN, I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT...

421
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,070
YEAH, ME, TOO. I KNOW.

422
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,271
YEAH.

423
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,273
YEAH.

424
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,575
SO, DO WE NEED TO HUG HERE OR...?

425
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,377
NO. WE'RE ALL RIGHT.

426
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,879
YEAH. YEAH.

427
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,282
SO, I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

428
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,584
PLASTIC SPOONS.

429
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:28,787
GREAT.

430
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,190
LICK AWAY, MY MAN.

431
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,292
THESE WILL GO GREAT IN MY NEW PLACE.

432
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,294
YOU KNOW, TILL I GET REAL ONES.

433
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,296
WHAT?

434
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,897
WELL, I CAN'T USE THESE FOREVER.

435
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,099
I MEAN, LET'S FACE IT--

436
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,101
THEY'RE NO FRIEND OF THE ENVIRONMENT.

437
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,902
NO, NO, I MEAN, WHAT...

438
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,504
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT YOUR NEW PLACE?

439
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,906
I'M MOVING OUT, LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT.

440
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:51,010
WELL, I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS SERIOUS.

441
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,813
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST A FIGHT.

442
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,215
WELL, IT WAS A FIGHT.

443
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,018
BASED ON SERIOUS STUFF, REMEMBER?

444
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,420
ABOUT HOW I NEVER LIVED ALONE OR ANYTHING?

445
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,822
I JUST THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR ME--

446
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,225
YOU KNOW, HELP ME TO GROW OR... WHATEVER.

447
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,930
WELL, THERE YOU GO.

448
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,134
HEY, ARE YOU COOL WITH THIS?

449
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:18,337
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU HIGH AND DRY.

450
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,140
HEY, NO. I'VE NEVER BEEN LOWER OR WETTER.

451
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,341
I'LL BE FINE.

452
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,443
I'LL JUST TURN YOUR, UH, BEDROOM

453
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,445
INTO A GAME ROOM OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?

454
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,047
PUT THE FOOSBALL TABLE IN THERE.

455
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:32,451
WHOA. WHY DO YOU GET TO KEEP THE TABLE?

456
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,652

457
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,556
I DID PAY FOR HALF OF IT.

458
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,158
YEAH, AND, UH...

459
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,759

460
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,361
... I PAID FOR THE OTHER HALF.

461
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,163
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

462
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,364
I'LL PLAY YOU FOR IT.

463
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,466
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE ON.

464
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:51,070
I COULD TAKE TWO MINUTES OUT OF MY DAY TO KICK YOUR ASS.

465
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,773
YOUR LITTLE MEN ARE GOING TO GET SCORED ON MORE TIMES

466
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,275
THAN YOUR SISTER.

467
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:02,281
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,WHOA.

468
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,683
WHICH SISTER?

469
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,888
SO, ARE YOU SORRY THAT I TOLD THEM?

470
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,490
NO. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

471
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,892
SINCE YOUR DAD AND I WENT RUNNING.

472
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,596
OH.

473
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,898
OH. WELL, DID YOU GET IT? LET ME SEE?

474
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:20,699
IS ROSS HERE?

475
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,301
NO. HE WENT OUT TO GET PIZZA.

476
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,203
OKAY, REALLY QUICK, OKAY?

477
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,804
THAT'S GREAT.

478
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,005
VERY TASTEFUL.

479
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,207
THANK YOU.

480
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,808
WANT TO SEE MINE? WANT TO SEE MINE?

481
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,009
YES!

482
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,112
WHAT? YOU DIDN'T GET ONE.

483
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,314
OKAY, WELL, THEN WHAT IS THIS?

484
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,318
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT?

485
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,921
THAT BLUE FRECKLE?

486
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,324
OKAY, THAT'S MY TATTOO.

487
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,025
THAT IS NOT A TATTOO.

488
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,227
THAT IS A NOTHING.

489
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,129
I FINALLY GOT HER BACK IN THE CHAIR

490
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,030
HE BARELY TOUCHED HER WITH THE NEEDLE

491
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,232
SHE JUMPED UP SCREAMING

492
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,333
AND THAT WAS IT.

493
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,134
OKAY, HI.

494
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,335

495
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,836
FOR YOUR INFORMATION

496
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:01,039
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED.

497
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,741
THIS IS A TATTOO

498
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:06,345
OF THE EARTH AS SEEN FROM A GREAT, GREAT DISTANCE.

499
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,349
IT'S THE WAY MY MOTHER SEES ME FROM HEAVEN.

500
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,151
OH... OH...

501
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,053
OH, WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP.

502
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,755
THAT IS A DOT.

503
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,957
YOUR MOTHER IS UP IN HEAVEN GOING

504
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,760
"WHERE THE HELL IS MY LILY, YOU WUSS?!"

505
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,463
OKAY?

506
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,064
PHOEBE, THAT IS NOT A TATTOO.

507
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,666
THIS IS A TATTOO!

508
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,173
YOU GOT A TATTOO?

509
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,175
MAYBE.

510
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,776
BUT JUST A LITTLE ONE.

511
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,778
PHOEBE GOT THE WHOLE WORLD.

512
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,782
WELL, LET ME SEE.

513
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,887
WELL?

514
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,889
WELL, IT'S REALLY...

515
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,891
SEXY.

516
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,794
I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE, BUT...

517
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,997
WOW.

518
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,201
REALLY?

519
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,603
YEAH. SO, UH...

520
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,806
IS IT SORE, OR CAN YOU DO STUFF?

521
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,810
I GUESS.

522
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,812
HEY, SAVE US SOME PIZZA.

523
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,916

524
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,820
GET IT OUT OF THE CORNER!

525
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,121
CENTER IT.

526
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:23,922
PASS IT.

527
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,123
PASS IT!

528
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,726
STOP TALKING TO YOUR MEN.

529
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,028
YES!

530
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,030
AND THE TABLE IS MINE.

531
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,035
CONGRATULATIONS.

532
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,045

533
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,551
HEY, YOU GUYS ARE STILL GOING TO COME VISIT ME, RIGHT?

534
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,553
OH, YEAH. YOU GOT THE BIG TV.

535
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,555
WE'LL BE OVER THERE ALL THE TIME.

536
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,756

537
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,858
EXCEPT WHEN WE ARE HERE.

538
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,164
I KNOW YOU'RE JUST MOVING UPTOWN

539
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,567
BUT I'M REALLY GOING TO MISS YOU.

540
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,169
I KNOW. HOW CAN YOU NOT BE ACROSS THE HALL ANYMORE?

541
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,171
YEAH. WHO'S GOING TO EAT ALL OUR FOOD

542
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,574
AND TIE UP OUR PHONE LINES, AND...?

543
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:16,775
IS THAT MY BRA?

544
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,280
WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING WITH MY BRA?

545
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,682
OH, NO, NO, IT'S, UH, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,284
WE, UH.... WE USED IT TO, YOU KNOW

547
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,885
FLING WATER BALLOONS OFF THE ROOF.

548
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,487
REMEMBER THAT?

549
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:29,688
THOSE JUNIOR HIGH KIDS

550
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,290
COULDN'T EVEN GET THEIRS ACROSS THE STREET.

551
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,692
YEAH, I REMEMBER.

552
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,797
HEY, LET'S BRING THE REST OF THESE DOWN TO THE TRUCK.

553
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,399
OKAY.

00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,000
THANKS.

555
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,006

556
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,608

00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,811
SO, UH... YOU WANT ME TO, UH, GIVE YOU A HAND

558
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,213

559
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,215
NAH.

560
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,317
YOU KEEP IT.

561
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,319
YOU NEED THE PRACTICE.

562
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,922

00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,926
I GUESS THIS IS IT.

565
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,528
YEAH. RIGHT. YEAH.

566
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,929
I GUESS SO.

567
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,334
LISTEN, UH...

568
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,136
I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'M GOING TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

569
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,238
WELL, I'M GUESSING, UH, TONIGHT AT THE COFFEE HOUSE.

570
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,840
RIGHT. YEAH.

571
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,641
OKAY.

572
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,643
UH... TAKE CARE.

573
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,646
YEAH.

574
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,583

575
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,284
HEY, DAD. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

576
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,286
I JUST STOPPED BY YOUR BOYFRIEND'S

577
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,288
TO GIVE HIM A PIECE OF MY MIND.

578
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,089
AND...?

579
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,290
AND I WAS GOING

580
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,892
TO PUNCH HIM IN THE NOSE

581
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,294
BUT HE HAD THE GAME ON, SO WE STARTED WATCHING.

582
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:18,697
UH HUH.

583
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:21,099
WELL, THEN, AT HALFTIME, I WAS GOING TO GIVE HIM WHAT FOR

584
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,101
BUT HE OFFERED ME A BEER, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

585
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:23,902
WHAT?

586
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,504
HE'S GOT IT ON TAP!

587
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,906
RIGHT IN HIS APARTMENT!

588
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,608
THE DAMN THING IS BUILT RIGHT INTO HIS BAR.

589
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:30,809
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

590
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,612
DAD, DID YOU TALK ABOUT ME?

591
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,014
OH, RIGHT. WELL...

592
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:39,117
ACTUALLY, WE NEVER GOT TO YOU.

593
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,719
LOOK...

594
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:41,720
YOU'RE A BIG GIRL.

595
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,321
I JUST HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

596
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,824
I DO.

597
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,426
DAD, YOU'RE WEARING

598
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,428
THE TIE THAT I GOT YOU.

599
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,029
YEAH.

600
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,331
SO, WHERE DID YOU GET THE HAT?

601
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,137
I DON'T KNOW.
