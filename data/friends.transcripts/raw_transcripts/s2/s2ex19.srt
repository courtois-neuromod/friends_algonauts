1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,208
HEY, EDDIE.

2
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,009

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,811
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

4
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:14,214
NOTHING, ROOMIE JUST WATCHING YOU SLEEP.

5
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:15,815
WHY?

6
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,618
IT MAKES ME FEEL, UM... PEACEFUL.

7
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:20,220
PLEASE.

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,022
I CAN'T SLEEP NOW.

9
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,623
YOU WANT ME TO SING?

10
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:24,824
NO.

11
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:26,426
LOOK, THAT'S IT. IT'S OVER.

12
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:27,627
I WANT YOU OUT.

13
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,629
I WANT YOU OUT OF THE APARTMENT NOW.

14
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,032
WHOA. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, MAN?

15
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,434
HANNIBAL LECTER?

16
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,436
BETTER ROOMMATE THAN YOU.

17
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,938
NO, NO, SEE, NOW I DON'T THINK YOU'RE BEING FAIR.

18
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:40,140
I MEAN, ONE NIGHT YOU SEE ME

19
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,341
AND YOU GET SCARED.

20
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,743
I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER NIGHTS

21
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:44,944
WHEN YOU DON'T SEE ME, HUH?

22
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:48,148
WHAT ABOUT LAST NIGHT, WHEN YOU WENT AND GOT A DRINK OF WATER

23
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,150
AND I WAS NICE ENOUGH TO HIDE BEHIND THE DOOR?

24
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,751
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT, HUH?

25
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:53,353
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT.

26
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:54,554
YEAH. HUH.

27
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,156
GET OUT NOW!

28
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,758
OKAY. YOU REALLY WANT ME OUT.

29
00:00:58,758 --> 00:00:59,959
YES, PLEASE.

30
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,561
THEN I WANT TO HEAR YOU SAY IT.

31
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,163
I WANT TO HEAR YOU SAY YOU WANT ME OUT.

32
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,364
I WANT YOU OUT.

33
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,366
NO, NO, NO. I WANT TO HEAR IT FROM YOUR LIPS.

34
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,169
WHERE DID YOU HEAR IT FROM BEFORE?!

35
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,171
ALL RIGHT! YOU KNOW WHAT, PALLY? I UNDERSTAND.

36
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,772
CONSIDER ME GONE. YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL DO?

37
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,374
I'LL GO MOVE INTO MY BROTHER'S BASEMENT.

38
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,376
WHEN HE FINDS OUT, I'LL GO FIND SOMEPLACE ELSE.

39
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:18,778
YOU KNOW WHAT?

40
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:20,080
I'LL BE OUT BY THE TIME

41
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,082
YOU GET HOME FROM WORK TOMORROW.

42
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,185
I HEARD THAT.

56
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:15,935
THANKS.

57
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,137
HEY.

58
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,338
HEY. HEY.

59
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:19,539
WELL, LOOK AT YOU.

60
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,141
FINALLY GOT THAT TIME MACHINE

61
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,342
WORKING, HUH?

62
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,143
YOU LIKE IT?

63
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,445
THIS GUY WAS SELLING THEM ON EIGHTH AVENUE

64
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,447
AND I LOOKED AT THEM AND I THOUGHT

65
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,048
"YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T HAVE?"

66
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,650
A MIRROR?

67
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,552
FINE. MAKE FUN.

68
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,554
I THINK IT'S JAUNTY.

69
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,357
WOW, FOR A GUY WHO'S RECENTLY LOST HIS JOB

70
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,359
YOU'RE IN AN AWFULLY GOOD MOOD.

71
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,960
HEY, I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

72
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,963
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE I'M STARTING FROM SQUARE ONE.

73
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,766
I WAS DR. DRAKE RAMORAY ON DAYS OF OUR LIVES.

74
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,569
I MEAN, THAT'S GOT TO HAVE SOME KIND OF CACHE.

75
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,672
"CACHE"? "JAUNTY"?

76
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,875
CHANDLER GAVE ME WORD OF THE DAY TOILET PAPER.

77
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,477
OH.

78
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,779
I'M GOING TO GET SOME COFFEE.

79
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,183
GO ON.

80
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,185
YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.

81
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,892
NO. NO?

82
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:13,693
NO.

83
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:14,894
HEY.

84
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,095
 HEY.

85
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,398
OOH! SO, SO, SO, DID YOU READ THE BOOK?

86
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,800
OH, MY GOD. IT WAS INCREDIBLE.

87
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,001
DIDN'T IT, LIKE, TOTALLY SPEAK TO YOU?

88
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,203
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

89
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,204
WHAT BOOK IS THIS?

90
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,206
RACHEL, YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK.

91
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,608
IT'S CALLED BE YOUR OWN WIND KEEPER.

92
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,411
IT'S ABOUT HOW WOMEN NEED TO BECOME MORE EMPOWERED.

93
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,012
YEAH, AND OH!

94
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,214
AND BUT THERE'S WIND...

95
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,016
AND THE WIND

96
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,218
CAN MAKE US GODDESSES

97
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,220
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHO TAKES OUR WIND?

98
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,821
MEN. THEY JUST TAKE IT.

99
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:43,823
THE...

100
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,226
MEN JUST TAKE OUR WIND.

101
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,627
YUH HUH. ALL THE TIME

102
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,430
BECAUSE THEY ARE THE LIGHTNING BEARERS.

103
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,931
WOW.

104
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,933
WELL, THAT SOUNDS KIND OF COOL.

105
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,336
IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE HOBBIT.

106
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,738
IT IS NOTHING LIKE THE HOBBIT.

107
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,541
GOD, IT'S LIKE READING ABOUT EVERY RELATIONSHIP

108
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,742
I'VE EVER HAD...

109
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,244
EXCEPT FOR RICHARD.

110
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,346
NO. RICHARD WOULD NEVER STEAL YOUR WIND.

111
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,547
NO.

112
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:08,348
BECAUSE HE'S YUMMY.

113
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,049
YES.

114
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,651
BUT ALL THE OTHER ONES...

115
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,052
OH, YES. AND THE PART ABOUT

116
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,256
HOW THEY'RE ALWAYS DRINKING FROM OUR POOL OF INNER POWER

117
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,258
BUT GOD FORBID WE SHOULD TAKE A SIP.

118
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,360
ANYBODY WANT A CRULLER?

119
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,561
OKAY.

120
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,963
THIS IS A TYPICAL LIGHTNING BEARER THING.

121
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,565
RIGHT THERE.

122
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,766
IT'S LIKE, UM...

123
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,969
"HELLO. WHO WANTS ONE OF MY PHALLIC SHAPED MAN CAKES?"

124
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,579
WHO HAVE YOU BEEN DATING?

125
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,988
 DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT ALREADY.

126
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:50,890
THINGS HAPPEN.

127
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,492
SO YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME

128
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,494
FOR GETTING FIRED AND EVERYTHING?

129
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,496
JOEY, LOOK AT ME.

130
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,498
LOOK AT ME!

131
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:03,603
DO I HAVE LIPSTICK ON MY TEETH?

132
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:06,806
NO.

133
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,408
CAN WE GET BACK TO ME?

134
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:12,812
LOOK, HONEY, PEOPLE GET FIRED LEFT AND RIGHT IN THIS BUSINESS.

135
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,015
I ALREADY GOT YOU AN AUDITION FOR ANOTHER WORLD.

136
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,717
ALL RIGHT.

137
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,119
"CAB DRIVER NUMBER TWO"?

138
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,021
YOU'RE WELCOME.

139
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,724
BUT I WAS DR. DRAKE RAMORAY.

140
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,326
HOW CAN I GO

141
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:30,029
FROM BEING A NEUROSURGEON TO DRIVING A CAB?

142
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,131
HEY, THERE WAS A TIME

143
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:34,133
WHEN I USED TO PLAY "TICKLE PICKLE"

144
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,735
WITH REX HARRISON.

145
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,038
THINGS CHANGE.

146
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,040
ROLL WITH THEM.

147
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,042
BUT THIS IS A TWO LINE PART.

148
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,044
IT'S LIKE TAKING A STEP BACKWARDS.

149
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,646
I'M NOT GOING TO DO THIS.

150
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:49,949
JOEY!

151
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,353
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THE SAME THING

152
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,155
I TOLD AL MINZER AND HIS PYRAMID OF DOGS.

153
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,260
TAKE ANY JOB YOU CAN GET, AND DON'T MAKE ON THE FLOOR.

154
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,464
I'M SORRY.

155
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,065
I'LL SEE YOU.

156
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,669
OH... GOD!

157
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,671
OH, GOD!

158
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,272
I MEAN, IT'S JUST SO...

159
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,474
ISN'T IT?

160
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,076
I MEAN, THIS IS LIKE READING ABOUT MY OWN LIFE.

161
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,479
I MEAN, THIS BOOK COULD HAVE BEEN CALLED

162
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,481
BE YOUR OWN WIND KEEPER, RACHEL.

163
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,684
YEAH, I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE SOLD A MILLION COPIES

164
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,687
BUT IT WOULD HAVE MADE A NICE GIFT FOR YOU.

165
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:28,888
HEY, YOU GUYS. HEY.

166
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,490
UH, SWEETIE, WE'VE GOT TO GO.

167
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,792
NO!

168
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,995
NO?

169
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,898
NO. WHY DO WE ALWAYS HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING

170
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,900
ACCORDING TO YOUR TIMETABLE?

171
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,804
ACTUALLY, IT'S THE MOVIE THEATER THAT HAS THE TIMETABLE.

172
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,607
IT'S SO YOU DON'T MISS THE BEGINNING.

173
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,810
NO. SEE, THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE MOVIE THEATER.

174
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,613
THIS IS ABOUT YOU STEALING MY WIND.

175
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,216
YOU GO, GIRL!

176
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:01,621
I CAN'T PULL THAT OFF, CAN I?

177
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,525
EXCUSE ME, YOUR...

178
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,126
YOUR YOUR WIND?

179
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,528
YES. MY WIND.

180
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,731
HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO GROW IF YOU WON'T LET ME BLOW?

181
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,641
YOU KNOW I I DON'T HAVE A...

182
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,344
HAVE A, A PROBLEM... WITH THAT.

183
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:34,754
OKAY.

184
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,758
I JUST... I JUST REALLY NEED TO BE

185
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:41,160
WITH MYSELF RIGHT NOW.

186
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,762
I'M SORRY.

187
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:43,863
MM MM MM.

188
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,264
UH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

189
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,866
I DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

190
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:47,967
SORRY.

191
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,569
DAMN IT!

192
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,677
I DON'T KNOW.

193
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,880
IT'S GOT ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT WIND AND TREES.

194
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,882
AND THERE'S SOME KIND OF SACRED POOL IN IT.

195
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,484
I MEAN, I DON'T REALLY GET IT

196
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,685
BUT SHE'S PRETTY UPSET ABOUT IT.

197
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,388
SEE, THIS IS WHY I DON'T DATE WOMEN WHO READ.

198
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,791
UH OH.

199
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,992
WHAT? WHAT'S THAT?

200
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,094
IT'S MY VISA BILL.

201
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:18,698
ENVELOPE ONE OF TWO.

202
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,700
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

203
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,301
OPEN IT. OPEN IT.

204
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,106
OH, MY GOD!

205
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,508
WHOA!

206
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,709
LOOK AT THIS.

207
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,310
HOW DID I SPEND SO MUCH MONEY?

208
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,312
THAT'S JUST THE MINIMUM AMOUNT DUE.

209
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,914
THAT'S YOUR TOTAL DUE.

210
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,716
AAH!

211
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,718
WHAT? WHOA, WHOA.

212
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,921
$3,500 DOLLARS AT "PORCELAIN SAFARI"?

213
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,923
MY ANIMALS.

214
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,525
THE GUY SAID THEY SUITED ME.

215
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,126
HE SPOKE WITH AN ACCENT.

216
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,327
I WAS ALL CONFUSED.

217
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,129
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

218
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,332
YOU CAN START BY DRIVING A CAB ON ANOTHER WORLD.

219
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:54,934
WHAT?

220
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,135
THAT AUDITION?

221
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,737
THAT'S A TWO LINE PART.

222
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:02,441
JOEY, YOU OWE $1,100 DOLLARS AT "I LOVE LUCITE."

223
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:03,242
SO WHAT?

224
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,844
SO SUCK IT UP, MAN.

225
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,145
IT'S A JOB. IT'S MONEY.

226
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,747
HEY, I DON'T NEED YOU

227
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,850
GETTING ALL JUDGMENTAL AND CONDESCENDING AND PEDANTIC.

228
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,451
TOILET PAPER?

229
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,953
YEAH.

230
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,955
LOOK, I'M NOT BEING ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

231
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,456
OKAY?

232
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,058
I'M JUST BEING REALISTIC.

233
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,860
KNOCK IT OFF. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MY FRIEND.

234
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,161
I AM YOUR FRIEND.

235
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,563
THEN TELL ME THINGS LIKE

236
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,565
"JOEY, YOU'LL BE FINE" AND "HANG IN THERE"

237
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,967
AND "SOMETHING BIG'S GOING TO COME ALONG. I KNOW IT!"

238
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,268
BUT I DON'T KNOW IT.

239
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,270
WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT YOU OWE $2,300 DOLLARS

240
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,272
AT "ISN'T IT CHROME ANTIC?"

241
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:36,576
HEY, ROSS, I'M AWARE OF WHAT I OWE.

242
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,877
OKAY, WELL, THEN GET SOME SENSE.

243
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,279
IT TOOK YOU, WHAT, TEN YEARS TO GET THAT JOB?

244
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,480
WHO KNOWS HOW LONG IT WILL BE

245
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,281
TILL YOU GET ANOTHER?

246
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:43,482
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS.

247
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,684
I'M JUST SAYING...

248
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,086
WELL, DON'T... JUST SAY.

249
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,990
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I SHOULD JUST GO.

250
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,391
OKAY.

251
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,593
OKAY.

252
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,095
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

253
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,097
YOU JUST THINK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

254
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,298
I DON'T NEED

255
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,200
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

256
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,202
I WAS DR. DRAKE RAMORAY!

257
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,804
THAT WAS HUGE.

258
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,806
BIG THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN.

259
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,007
YOU'LL SEE.

260
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,009
ROSS?

261
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,011
YOU STILL THERE?

262
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,931

263
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:34,734
HEY, PALLY!

264
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,736
OH,GOD!

265
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,538
EDDIE, WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE?

266
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:43,142
AH, JUST SOME BASIC DEHYDRATING OF A FEW FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.

267
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,144
MAN ALIVE! THIS THING'S FANTASTIC!

268
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,447
LOOK, EDDIE, AREN'T YOU FORGETTING ANYTHING?

269
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,449
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. I GOT US A NEW GOLDFISH.

270
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,052
HE'S A LOT FEISTIER THAN THE LAST ONE.

271
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:56,255
MAYBE BECAUSE THE LAST ONE WAS MADE BY PEPPERIDGE FARM.

272
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:59,058
LOOK, EDDIE, ISN'T THERE SOMETHING ELSE

273
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,560
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING RIGHT NOW?

274
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,562
WELL, NOT UNLESS IT'S GOT SOMETHING

275
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,164
TO DO WITH DEHYDRATING, MY MAN

276
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,768
BECAUSE, RIGHT NOW, I'M A DEHYDRATING MANIAC!

277
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,369
LOOK, YOU HAVE TO HELP ME OUT HERE.

278
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,570
I THOUGHT WE HAD A DEAL.

279
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,572
I THOUGHT, BY THE TIME... UH UH.

280
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:14,774
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

281
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,176
YOUR LAST ROOMMATE'S KIDNEY?

282
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,377
NO, MAN.

283
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,979
THAT'S A... THAT'S A TOMATO.

284
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,981
THIS ONE DEFINITELY GOES IN THE DISPLAY.

285
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,983

286
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,389

287
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,494
HEY, GUNTHER, LET ME GET A, UH, LEMONADE TO GO.

288
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:36,696
LEMONADE?

289
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,098
YOU OKAY, MAN?

290
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,200
AW, IT'S CAREER STUFF-- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD

291
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,003
BUT THEY'VE KILLED OFF MY CHARACTER ON THE SHOW.

292
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,604
AW, THAT'S TOO BAD.

293
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,206
HOW'D THEY DO IT?

294
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,309
I FELL DOWN AN ELEVATOR SHAFT.

295
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,510
AW, THAT SUCKS.

296
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,512
I WAS BURIED IN AN AVALANCHE.

297
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,815
WHAT?

298
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:59,018
I USED TO BE "BRYCE" ON ALL MY CHILDREN.

299
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,337

300
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:19,939

301
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,441
WHY MUST EVERYBODY WATCH ME SLEEP?

302
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,643
THERE'LL BE NO MORE WATCHING ME SLEEP.

303
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:25,845
NO MORE... WATCHING!

304
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:26,645
I WA...

305
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:27,947
NO!

306
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,756
AH!

307
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,957
HEY, MAN, CHECK IT OUT.

308
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,959
I GOT SOME GREAT NEW STUFF TO DEHYDRATE.

309
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,861
I GOT SOME GRAPES, GOT SOME APRICOTS.

310
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,163
I THOUGHT IT'D BE REALLY COOL TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

311
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,364
WITH THESE WATER BALLOONS.

312
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,466
GET OUT, GET OUT, GET OUT, GET OUT!

313
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,667
GET OUT, GET OUT, GET OUT!

314
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,669
WHAT?

315
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,470
YOU--

316
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,072
MOVE OUT.

317
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,074
TAKE YOUR FRUIT  YOUR STUPID SMALL FRUIT

318
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,275
AND GET OUT!

319
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,677
YOU WANT... YOU WANT ME TO MOVE OUT?

320
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,482
UH HUH.

321
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,086
I, UH...

322
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,387
I GOT TO TELL YOU, MAN.

323
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:11,590
I MEAN, THAT'S KIND OF OUT OF THE BLUE, DON'T YOU THINK?

324
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,793
THIS IS NOT OUT OF THE BLUE.

325
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,996
THIS IS SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BLUE!

326
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:17,997
WHOA!

327
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,999
RELAX. TAKE IT EASY, BUDDY.

328
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,600
DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME TWICE.

329
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,202
YOU WANT ME TO GO?

330
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,104
ALL RIGHT.

331
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,606
SOMEONE'LL BE BY FOR MY STUFF.

332
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,612
BUT IF YOU THINK FOR ONE SECOND

333
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,614
I'M LEAVING YOU ALONE WITH MY FISH

334
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:36,415
YOU'RE INSANE, JACK!

335
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,616
YOU WANT SOME HELP?

336
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:41,620
NO HELP REQUIRED, CHICO.

337
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,028
YOU DON'T SEE THAT EVERY DAY.

338
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,934
ALL THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT, HUH?

339
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,535
YOU KNOW, THAT'S OVER 30 MILES.

340
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,039
THAT'S GOING TO COST YOU ABOUT SO BUCKS.

341
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,842
EXCUSE ME. THAT'S 50 BUCKS.

342
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,343
WHAT?

343
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,946
5-0... DOLLARS.

344
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,948
OH. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?

345
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,350
IT'S SMUDGY BECAUSE THEY'RE FAX PAGES.

346
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,352
NOW, WHEN I WAS ONDAYS OF OUR LIVES

347
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,553
AS DR. DRAKE RAMORAY...

348
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,255
THEY'D SEND OVER

349
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,058
THE WHOLE SCRIPT ON REAL PAPER AND EVERYTHING.

350
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,160
THAT'S GREAT.

351
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,761
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW

352
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,363
IF YOU WANTED TO EXPAND THIS SCENE

353
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,365
LIKE HAVE THE CAB CRASH OR SOMETHING

354
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,967
I COULD ATTEND TO THE VICTIMS

355
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,369
BECAUSE I HAVE A BACKGROUND IN MEDICAL ACTING.

356
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,671
OKAY, LISTEN, THANKS FOR COMING IN.

357
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,474
NO, NO. DON'T THANK ME FOR COMING IN.

358
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,676
AT LEAST LET ME FINISH.

359
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,581
UH... WE COULD TAKE THE EXPRESSWAY

360
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,583
BUT, UH, THIS TIME OF DAY

361
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,786
YOU'RE BETTER OFF TAKING THE BUDGE.

362
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,191
YOU WERE GOING FOR THE WORD "BRIDGE" THERE, WEREN'T YOU?

363
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,292
YEAH.

364
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,294
I'LL HAVE A GOOD DAY.

365
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,601
NO, OKAY, HONEY, I KNOW YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO.

366
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,203
I KNOW. ME, TOO.

367
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,404
 RACH, HANG UP!

368
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,806
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TAKING A "GODDESS" QUIZ.

369
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,508
YOU SHOULD LOSE, LIKE, A HUNDRED POINTS

370
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:12,411
JUST FOR CALLING YOUR BOYFRIEND IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

371
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,013
BYE BYE.

372
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,218
OKAY, QUESTION NUMBER 28:

373
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,620
"HAVE YOU EVER ALLOWED A LIGHTNING BEARER

374
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,222
TO TAKE YOUR WIND?"

375
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,925
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY NO.

376
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:30,229
AND I WOULD HAVE TO SAY PA HA!

377
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,331
WHAT?

378
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,233
DO YOU NOT REMEMBER THE PUPPET GUY?

379
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,635
YEAH. YOU LIKE TOTALLY LET HIM WASH HIS FEET

380
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,438
IN THE POOL OF YOUR INNER POWER.

381
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,441
AND HIS PUPPET, TOO.

382
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,144
YEAH, OKAY, WELL, AT LEAST I DIDN'T LET SOME GUY

383
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,947
INTO THE FOREST OF MY RIGHTEOUS TRUTH ON THE FIRST DATE.

384
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,052
WHO?!

385
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:53,652
PAUL!

386
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,154
OH!

387
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,156
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY. MOVING ON, MOVING ON.

388
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,357
NEXT QUESTION.

389
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,959
OKAY, NUMBER 29:

390
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,162
"HAVE YOU EVER BETRAYED ANOTHER GODDESS...

391
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,164
FOR A LIGHTNING BEARER?"

392
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:06,765
OKAY, NUMBER 30.

393
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,167
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

394
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,768
LET'S GO BACK TO 29.

395
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,972
NOT, UH...

396
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,173

397
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,975
NOT TO... MY RECOLLECTION.

398
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,775

399
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,877
ALL RIGHT, DANNY ARSHACK, NINTH GRADE.

400
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,079
OH, COME ON, RACH.

401
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,481
YOU KNOW THE BOTTLE WAS TOTALLY POINTING AT ME.

402
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,384
ONLY BECAUSE YOU TOOK UP HALF THE CIRCLE.

403
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,785

404
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,489
LISTEN TO YOU TWO.

405
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,091
IT'S SO SAD. OH.

406
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,093
LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING TO BE GOING

407
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,095
TO THE GODDESS MEETINGS ALONE.

408
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,696
WELL, NOT WHEN

409
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:40,299
THEY FIND OUT YOU SLEPT WITH JASON HURLEY

410
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:43,202
AN HOUR AFTER HE BROKE UP WITH MONICA.

411
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,405
THAT WAS ONLY AN HOUR?

412
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,608
YOU ARE SUCH A LEAF BLOWER!

413
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,210
POOL DRAINER!

414
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,711
TWIG SNAPPER!

415
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,013
MONKEY BUTT!

416
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,217
THAT IS NOT IN THE BOOK.

417
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,818
NO, BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE!

418
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,624
OH!

419
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,234
OH, HEY, BE CAREFUL WITH THAT 3 D "LAST SUPPER."

420
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,236
JUDAS IS A LITTLE LOOSE.

421
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,443
OH, MY GOD. WHAT'S GOING ON?

422
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,445
THEY'RE TAKING ALL MY STUFF BACK.

423
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,847
I GUESS YOU WERE RIGHT.

424
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,449
NO, LOOK, I WASN'T RIGHT.

425
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,451
THAT'S WHAT I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU.

426
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,853
I... I WAS TOTALLY HUNG UP

427
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,855
ON MY OWN STUFF THE OTHER DAY.

428
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,457
LISTEN. I'M SOMEONE WHO NEEDS

429
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,459
THE WHOLE SECURITY THING, YOU KNOW?

430
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,262
TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE MY NEXT PAYCHECK IS COMING FROM

431
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,264
BUT YOU... YOU DON'T NEED THAT.

432
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,266
AND THAT'S AMAZING TO ME.

433
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,668
I COULD NEVER DO WHAT YOU DO, JOEY.

434
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:50,869
THANKS, ROSS.

435
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,272
YEAH, YOU SHOULD HOLD OUT FOR SOMETHING BIGGER.

436
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,574
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH RESPECT I HAVE FOR YOU

437
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,377
FOR NOT GOING TO THAT STUPID CAB DRIVER AUDITION.

438
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,478
I WENT.

439
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,679
GREAT! HOW DID IT GO?

440
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,081
I DIDN'T GET IT.

441
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,282
GOOD FOR YOU! WHAT?

442
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,783
YOU'RE LIVING THE DREAM!

443
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:05,984
HUH?

444
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,487
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

445
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,089
OH, NOT MY PARROT.

446
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,590
WHAT?

447
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,392
I CAN'T WATCH THIS.

448
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,995
HEY, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

449
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,997
HOW MUCH FOR THE, UH...

00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,999
HOW MUCH TO SAVE THE BIRD?

451
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,201
1,200.

452
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,602
DOLLARS?

453
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,605
YOU SPENT $1,200 DOLLARS ON A PLASTIC BIRD?

454
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,708
UH, UH, IT WAS AN IMPULSE BUY-- NEAR THE REGISTER.

455
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,111
GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD WITH THE BIRD.

456
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,312
IT'S OKAY.

457
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,115
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING FOR AROUND $200 DOLLARS?

458
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,316
UH...

459
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,517

00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:39,718
HUH?

465
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,429
YEAH.

466
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,831
I REALLY LIKE THAT BIRD THOUGH.

467
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,433
BUT THE DOG-- OH...

468
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,634
YEAH, RIGHT.

469
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,244
HERE ARE YOUR CAKES.

470
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,645
WE DIDN'T ORDER CAKE.

471
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,147
NO, I KNOW.

472
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,748
THEY'RE FROM ME.

473
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:12,151
LOOK, YOU GUYS, THIS IS NOT GOOD.

474
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,553
WE HAVE ENOUGH TROUBLE WITH GUYS STEALING OUR WIND

475
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,555
WITHOUT TAKING IT FROM EACH OTHER.

476
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,358
YOU'RE RIGHT.

477
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,860
I LOVE YOU, GODDESSES.

478
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,663
WE LOVE YOU.

479
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,565
I DON'T EVER WANT TO SUCK YOUR WIND AGAIN.

480
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:27,766
OH...

481
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:28,567
THANK YOU.

485
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,772
OKAY, LET ME TAKE THESE CAKES BACK

00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,774

487
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,676
OUT OF MY PAYCHECK.

488
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,879
DING DONG, THE PSYCHO'S GONE.

00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,987
YES. YES, I ACTUALLY SAW HIM LEAVE.

491
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:52,191

00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,996
HEY, CHECK IT OUT, MAN.

494
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:01,600
I TORE IT OFF SOME MANNEQUIN IN THE ALLEY BEHIND MACY'S.

495
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,801
THERE IS NO ALLEY BEHIND MACY'S.

496
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,204
SO I GOT IT IN THE JUNIOR MISS DEPARTMENT BIG DIF.

497
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,805

WELL, I...

00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:07,225
I THINK WE'D REMEMBER SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

539
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:09,127
I KNOW I WOULD.

00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,390
UH, IT'S A CANTALOUPE.

562
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,797
LOOK, ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO BRING THIS OUT

563
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,399
EVERY TIME ROSS COMES OVER?

564
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,000
HE PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR IT.

565
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,409
I'M GOING TO HOLD HIM A DIFFERENT WAY.

566
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,810
LOOK, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

567
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,812
IF YOU HATED IT SO MUCH

568
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,814
WHY DID YOU BUY IT IN THE FIRST PLACE?

569
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,816
WELL, I HAD A WHOLE CERAMIC ZOO THING

570
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,418
GOING OVER THERE, BUT...

571
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,320
NOW, WITHOUT THE OTHER ONES, IT JUST LOOKS TACKY.

572
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,322
YEAH, WITH THINGS LIKE THIS, MORE IS ALWAYS BETTER.

573
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,425
YEAH.

574
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,227
SO IS HE HOUSE TRAINED, OR IS HE GOING TO LEAVE

575
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,229
LITTLE BATHROOM TILES ALL OVER

576
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:52,831
THE PLACE?

577
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,633
STAY.

578
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,635
UH, STAY!

579
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,236
GOOD FAKE DOG.
