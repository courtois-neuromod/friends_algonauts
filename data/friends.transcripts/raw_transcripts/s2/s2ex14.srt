00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,107
HEY.

2
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:07,907
HEY.

3
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:10,310
HOLD ON A SECOND.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,511

5
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,312
HUH?

6
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:13,613
NICE.

7
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:14,614
NICE.

8
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,316
HEY, I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

9
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:17,517
WHAT'S THIS?

10
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,319
812 BUCKS.

11
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,621
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT BIG LEON TOLD YOU

12
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:23,623
BUT IT'S AN EVEN THOUSAND IF YOU WANT ME

13
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,225
FOR THE WHOLE NIGHT.

14
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,326
WHAT IS THIS FOR?

15
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:27,527
WELL, I'M MAKING MONEY NOW

16
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:29,129
AND THIS IS PAYING YOU BACK

17
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,131
FOR HEAD SHOTS, ELECTRIC BILLS

18
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,533
AND SO MANY SLICES OF PIZZA, I CAN'T EVEN COUNT.

19
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,734
I LOVE YOU, MAN.

20
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,336
WELL, THANKS, MAN.

21
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,338
NOW I CAN GET MY PONY.

22
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,940
HEY, THIS IS A LITTLE EXTRA SOMETHING

23
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,144
FOR, YOU KNOW, ALWAYS BEING THERE FOR ME.

24
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,746
WOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

25
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,955
WOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

26
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:57,557
HUH? WHAT DO YOU SAY?

27
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,758
I DON'T KNOW.

28
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,961
IT'S A BRACELET.

29
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,163
ISN'T IT?

30
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,364
AND IT'S ENGRAVED, TOO.

31
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,565
CHECK IT OUT.

32
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,567
"TO MY BEST BUD."

33
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,973
THANKS, BEST BUD.

34
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:14,874

35
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,076
PUT IT ON.

36
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,277
OH, NOW?

37
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,878

38
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,480
NO, NO, I THINK SOMETHING THIS NICE

39
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,482
SHOULD BE SAVED FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION.

40
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,884
OH, NO, NO, THAT'S THE BEAUTY PART.

41
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,486
IT GOES WITH EVERYTHING.

42
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,988
YOU PUT THIS ON... YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.

43
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,192
WELL, I'VE NEVER BEEN GOOD TO GO

44
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,393
SO WHAT THE HELL?

45
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,594
WHY NOT TRY SOME JEWELRY, HUH?

46
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:36,196
YEAH.

47
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:40,200
OH HO HO, MAN.

48
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,403
YOU ARE SO WEARING THAT BRACELET. WHOO.

49
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,206
I SO AM.

50
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,407
WHOA, YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

51
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,809
WHAT THIS WILL DO FOR YOUR SEX LIFE?

52
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,911
IT'LL PROBABLY SLOW IT DOWN AT FIRST

53
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,913
BUT, ONCE I GET USED TO THE EXTRA WEIGHT

54
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,915
I'LL BE BACK ON TRACK.

68
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,063
WELL, THIS ALL LOOKS GOOD.

69
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,665
GREAT.

70
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,468
IF I WANT TO CALL FOR A REFERENCE ON YOUR LAST JOB?

71
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,170
OH, THAT'S THERE ON THE BOTTOM.

72
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,771
"SEE THE MANAGER-- CHANDLER BING."

73
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,373
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE IF YOU'RE

74
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,276
AS GOOD IN PERSON AS YOU ARE ON PAPER.

75
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,477
MAKE ME A SALAD.

76
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,578
A SALAD? REALLY?

77
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,980
I COULD DO SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED, IF YOU LIKE.

78
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,683
NO, JUST A SALAD WILL BE FINE.

79
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,285
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT IT.

80
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,287
NOW, I WANT YOU TO TELL ME

81
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,890
WHAT YOU'RE DOING WHILE YOU'RE DOING IT.

82
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,492
ALL RIGHT.

83
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,894
WELL, I'M TEARING THE LETTUCE.

84
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,496
UH HUH. IS IT DIRTY?

85
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,398
NO, DON'T WORRY. I'LL WASH IT.

86
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,900
DON'T. I LIKE IT DIRTY.

87
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,904
IT'S... YOUR CALL.

88
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:28,107
SO, UH... WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NEXT?

89
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,910
WELL, I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD CUT UP THE TOMATOES.

90
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,713
ARE THEY, UH, FIRM?

91
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:36,716
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT.

92
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,118
YOU SURE THEY HAVEN'T GONE BAD?

93
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,521
YOU SURE THEY'RE NOT VERY, VERY BAD?

94
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,227
NO, REALLY, THEY'RE OKAY.

95
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,329
YOU GOING TO SLICE THEM UP REAL NICE?

96
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,731
ACTUALLY, I WAS GOING TO DO THEM JULIENNE.

97
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,833

98
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,835
I'M OUT OF HERE.

99
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,244

100
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,044
HELLO.

101
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,447
NO, RACHEL'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW.

102
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,048
CAN I TAKE A MESSAGE?

103
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,850
AND HOW DO WE SPELL CASEY?

104
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,053
IS IT LIKE "AT THE BAT" OR "AND THE SUNSHINE BAND"?

105
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,455
OKAY.

106
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,556
BYE BYE.

107
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,560
HEY, WHO'S THIS, UH, THIS CASEY?

108
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,262
OH, SOME GUY SHE MET AT THE MOVIES.

109
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,063
OH, REALLY? WHAT DOES HE WANT WITH HER?

110
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,466
WELL, I'M GUESSING HE WANTS TO

111
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,368
DO A LITTLE DANCE...

112
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,070
YOU KNOW, MAKE A LITTLE LOVE.

113
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,074
WELL, PRETTY MUCH GET DOWN TONIGHT.

114
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,282
I DON'T KNOW.

115
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,683
I DON'T GET IT.

116
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,886
TWO MONTHS AGO, RACHEL AND I WERE THIS CLOSE, RIGHT?

117
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,087
NOW I'M TAKING MESSAGES

118
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,490
FROM GUYS SHE... SHE MEETS AT THE MOVIES?

119
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,091
I MEAN, THIS CASEY SHOULD BE

120
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,093
TAKING DOWN MY MESSAGES, YOU KNOW?

121
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,496
OR, OR... RACHEL AND I SHOULD BE TOGETHER

122
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,697
AND WE SHOULD GET...

123
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:01,301
SOME KIND OF MESSAGE SERVICE.

124
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,502
HANG IN THERE.

125
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:03,703
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

126
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,605
NOW HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

127
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,508
BECAUSE SHE'S YOUR LOBSTER.

128
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,011
OH, SHE'S GOING SOMEWHERE.

129
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,214
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

130
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,216
IT'S A KNOWN FACT THAT LOBSTERS

131
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,818
FALL IN LOVE AND MATE FOR LIFE.

132
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,019
YOU KNOW WHAT?

133
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,422
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE OLD LOBSTER COUPLES

134
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,023
WALKING AROUND THEIR TANK

135
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,625
YOU KNOW, HOLDING CLAWS, LIKE...

136
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,230
YOU HAVE... YOU HAVE TO PICTURE LOBSTERS.

137
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,936
HEY, YOU FEELING BETTER?

138
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,538
YEAH, I THINK THAT FIFTH SHOWER

139
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,540
ACTUALLY GOT THE INTERVIEW OFF ME.

140
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,343
SO, DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER POSSIBILITIES?

141
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,345
YEAH, WELL, THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY

142
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,546
THAT I WON'T MAKE RENT.

143
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,948
MONICA, IF YOU WANT, I CAN LEND YOU SOME MONEY.

144
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:52,452
NO, NO, BECAUSE IF I COULDN'T PAY YOU BACK RIGHT AWAY

145
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,254
I'D FEEL GUILTY AND TENSE EVERY TIME I SAW YOU.

146
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,657
OH, OKAY. WELL, WHY DON'T YOU BORROW IT FROM MOM AND DAD?

147
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,059
YOU FEEL GUILTY AND TENSE AROUND THEM ALREADY.

148
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,462
YOU MIGHT AS WELL MAKE SOME MONEY

149
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,663
OFF OF THEM.

150
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,264
YOU KNOW, THE MAN'S GOT A POINT.

151
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,466
OOH.

152
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,469
WHAT IS THAT SPARKLY THING?

153
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,670
THAT THING?

154
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,772
IT'S A, UH...

155
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,575
YEAH, IT'S...

156
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,577
IT'S A LITTLE FLASHY.

157
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,579
NO, NO. NO, NO.

158
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,382
IT'S NOT FLASHY-- NOT FOR A GOODFELLA.

159
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,184
MAN!

160
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,386
MAN, THAT IS SHARP.

161
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,188
THAT MUST HAVE COST YOU QUITE A FEW DOUBLOONS.

162
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,591
NO, IT'S FUN. IT'S FUN.

163
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,993
IT'S KIND OF LIKE KNOWING ONE OF THE GABOR SISTERS.

164
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:39,999
HI.

165
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,601
HI. HI, DARLING.

166
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,802
SO, WHAT'S THIS?

167
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,504
SOME OF YOUR OLD STUFF.

168
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,707
WELL, SWEETIE, WE HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

169
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,209
WE'RE TURNING YOUR ROOM INTO A GYM.

170
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,813
WOW, THAT IS A SURPRISE.

171
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,415
JUST ONE LITTLE QUESTION.

172
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,016
UH, WHY NOT ROSS' ROOM?

173
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,518
GOSH, WE TALKED ABOUT THAT

174
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,320
BUT YOUR BROTHER HAS SO MANY SCIENCE TROPHIES

175
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,322
AND PLAQUES AND MERIT BADGES...

176
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,725
WELL, WE DIDN'T WANT TO DISTURB THEM.

177
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,126
OH, GOD FORBID.

178
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,728
SO, WHAT'S NEW WITH YOU?

179
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,329
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?

180
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:11,531
HOW'S YOUR JOB?

181
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,433
MY JOB?

182
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,034
WELL, UH... DID I MENTION

183
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,036
I STILL DON'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

184
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:21,040
OH, WELL, I JUST ASSUMED.

185
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:24,944
OH, HI.

186
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,945
HELLO.

187
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,447
RACHEL, OH...

188
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,048
WE WERE SO SORRY TO HEAR

189
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,050
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS SPLITTING UP, DEAR.

190
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,453
WELL, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE JUST SEPARATED

191
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,054
SO, YOU NEVER KNOW. WE'LL SEE.

192
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,457
WELL, I CAN'T SAY ANY OF US WERE SURPRISED.

193
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,261
YOUR PARENTS HAVE BEEN UNHAPPY EVER SINCE

194
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,563
WE'VE KNOWN THEM...

195
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,565
ESPECIALLY AFTER THAT INCIDENT

196
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:46,666
IN HAWAII.

197
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,267
WHAT...

198
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,469
WHAT INCIDENT?

199
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,070
UH, NO. NO, NO, NO, NO

200
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,072
I MUST BE THINKING OF SOMEONE ELSE.

201
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,074
MAYBE ME. HA!

202
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,176
DON'T YOU HAVE SOME FOLDING TO DO?

203
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,778
GO FOLD, DEAR, FOLD.

204
00:07:58,778 --> 00:07:59,979
YOU FOLD. GO AHEAD.

205
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:03,683
DO YOU WANT A REFILL?

206
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,685
NO, I'M ALL RIGHT. THANKS.

207
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:07,386
 OKAY. OOH.

208
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,288
OKAY, YOU GOT TO GIVE ME A SECOND.

209
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,290
I WANT TO GET THIS JUST RIGHT.

210
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,892

211
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,695

212
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:19,198
DUDE-- 11:00, TOTALLY HOT BABE CHECKING YOU OUT.

213
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:22,802
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.

214
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,204
THINK I'M READY FOR MY PENIS NOW.

215
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,114
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING--

216
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,116
DAVE THOMAS, FOUNDER OF WENDY'S.

217
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,518

218
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,719
I'M GAIL.

219
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,520
CHANDLER.

220
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,721

221
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,524
I... I, I REALLY HAVE TO BE SOMEWHERE

222
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,526
BUT IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU.

223
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,027
WHA...

224
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,629
WHA...

225
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,033
OH, THIS IS EXCELLENT.

226
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,435
YOU KNOW, HE COULD HAVE GOT ME A V.C.R.

227
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,838
HE COULD HAVE GOT ME A SET OF GOLF CLUBS

228
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,240
BUT NO, HE HAS TO GET ME "THE WOMAN REPELLER."

229
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,645
THE EYESORE FROM THE LIBERACE HOUSE OF CRAP!

230
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,346
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

231
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,749
OH, EASY FOR YOU TO SAY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WALK AROUND

232
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,751
SPORTING SOME REJECT FROM THE MR. "T" COLLECTION.

233
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,352
CHANDLER... CHANDLER.

234
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:16,556
"I PITY THE FOOL THAT PUTS ON MY JEWELRY!

235
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,857
"I DO! I DO!

236
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,458
I PITY THE FOOL THAT--" HI.

237
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,662
HEY, MAN, WE WERE JUST DOING

238
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,664
SOME IMPRESSIONS OVER HERE.

239
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,865
DO YOUR MARCEL MARCEAU.

240
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,769
THAT'S ACTUALLY GOOD.

241
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,379
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT GUY?

242
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,981
HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN TALKING TO HER?

243
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,983
I DON'T KNOW. COUPLE OF MINUTES.

244
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,284
YEAH? TRY DOUBLING THAT.

245
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,888
IT'S LIKE, BACK OFF, BUDDY.

246
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,290
SHE'S A WAITRESS, NOT A GEISHA.

247
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,292
I THINK SHE'S OKAY.

248
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,394
LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THAT.

249
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:58,497
SEE HOW SHE'S PUSHING HIM AWAY, AND HE WON'T BUDGE?

250
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,299
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING.

251
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,001
YEAH, YOU CAN GET A CONDO

252
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,603
RIGHT ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE.

253
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,005
YOU SKI IN, SKI OUT. IT'S GREAT.

254
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,206
I LOVE IT.

255
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,809
EXCUSE ME? ARE YOU RACHEL?

256
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,410
WHAT?

257
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,813
ROSS GELLER.

258
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,616
GOD, IN YOUR AD YOU SAID YOU WERE PRETTY...

259
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,217
BUT WOW.

260
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,620
WHAT ARE YOU... WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

261
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,823
OH, MY GOD. IS THIS... IS THIS THE WRONG DAY?

262
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,024
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

263
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,225
I GUESS, IF IT WORKS OUT

264
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,428
WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL THE GRANDKIDS.

265
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:30,830
YOU SURE WILL.

266
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,832
I'VE, UH... GOT TO GO.

267
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,033
WAIT... WHAT...

268
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,234
TAKE CARE.

269
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,435
OKAY. SEE YOU LATER.

270
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,838
NICE MEETING YOU.

271
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,039

272
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,240
YOU'RE WELCOME.

273
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,542
WHAT?

274
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,444
I WAS SAVING YOU.

275
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,446
SAVE ME FROM THE PLEASANT CONVERSATION

276
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,048
WITH THE INTERESTING MAN?

277
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,650
OH, SEE, FROM WHERE I WAS SITTING...

278
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,251
OKAY, ROSS, LISTEN TO ME.

279
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,054
I AM NOT YOURS TO SAVE.

280
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,056
BUT, YOU ARE.

281
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:57,857
WHAT?

282
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,058
WELL, YOU, UM...

283
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,460
YOU'RE MY LOBSTER.

284
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,864
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

285
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,667
ARE YOU BEING, LIKE, THE BLIND DATE GUY AGAIN?

286
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,669
NO, NO.

287
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,671
YOU'RE MY LOBSTER.

288
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,274
SEE, UM... LOBSTERS, UH...

289
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:18,878
IN THE TANK, WHEN THEY'RE OLD, UH...

290
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,079
THEY GET WITH THE...

291
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,882
THEY WALK AROUND HOLDING THE CLAWS.

292
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,485
IN THE TANK, YOU KNOW?

293
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,388
WITH... WITH THE HOLDING? AND...

294
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,790
PHEEBS, YOU WANT TO HELP ME OUT

295
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,391
WITH THE WHOLE LOBSTER THING?

296
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,293
DO THE CLAWS AGAIN.

297
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,798
RACH... OKAY, FORGET THE LOBSTERS, OKAY?

298
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,800
WE'RE... LET'S TALK... WHAT ABOUT US?

299
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,202
ROSS, THERE IS NO US.

300
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,003
OKAY?

301
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,604
NO, BUT...

302
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:46,806
NO, LISTEN TO ME.

303
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,208
I FELL FOR YOU, AND I GET CLOBBERED.

304
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,810
YOU, THEN, FALL FOR ME

305
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,212
AND I, AGAIN, SOMEHOW GET CLOBBERED.

306
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,015
I'M TIRED OF BEING CLOBBERED, YOU KNOW?

307
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,017
IT'S... IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT.

308
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,218
WELL, BUT... BUT...

309
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,020
NO "BUT," ROSS.

310
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,823
WE ARE NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN, OKAY?

311
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,424
ACCEPT THAT.

312
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,026
EX... EXCEPT...

313
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,028
EXCEPT THAT WHAT?

314
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,831
NO.

315
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,432
NO.

316
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,235
ACCEPT... THAT.

317
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,440
OH.

318
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,747
I GOT TO GO.

319
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,558
HEY, MAN. LOOK, IT'S MY BEST BUD.

320
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,160
HOW YOU DOING?

321
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,162
WOW. YOU ARE REALLY GETTING GOOD

322
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,164
AT THAT MARCEL MARCEAU THING.

323
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,568
HEY, LISTEN, WHAT DO YOU SAY WE PLAY SOME BALL?

324
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,369
YOU AND ME. HUH?

325
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,974
OKAY, THAT'S MY BAD.

326
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,676
IF YOU HATED THE BRACELET SO MUCH, CHANDLER

327
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,678
YOU SHOULD'VE JUST SAID SO.

328
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,680
WELL, DOESN'T THE FACT THAT I WORE THE BRACELET

329
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,282
EVEN THOUGH I HATED IT SAY SOMETHING

330
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,384
ABOUT OUR FRIENDSHIP AND HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO ME?

331
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:08,187
WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU INSULTED THE BRACELET

332
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,388
AND YOU MADE FUN OF ME?

333
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,791
OKAY, WELL, THAT'S THE PART WHERE I'M A WANK...

334
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,795
BUT I WAS HOPING, YOU KNOW, WE WOULDN'T FOCUS ON THAT.

335
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,596
OH, YEAH?

336
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,398
WELL, FOCUS ON THIS.

337
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,601

338
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,603
HARD TO ARGUE WITH THAT.

339
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:29,108
COME ON, MAN. I SAID I WAS SORRY, LIKE, A HUNDRED TIMES.

340
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,911
I PROMISE, I WILL NEVER TAKE IT OFF MY...

341
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,512
WRIST.

342
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,717
BUT IF YOU WANT TO STAY IN THERE AND BE MAD

343
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,921
YOU JUST, UH, YOU STAY IN THERE.

344
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,923
YOU KNOW WHAT?

345
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,426
I AM HERE ON MY KNEES...

346
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,629
HOLDING UP THESE COUCH CUSHIONS...

347
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,833
AS A SYMBOL OF MY SORROW AND REGRET...

348
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,937
MUCH LIKE THEY DID IN BIBLICAL TIMES.

349
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:00,339
THOUGH YOU MAY HAVE THE ANGER NOW...

350
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,144
YOU'RE GOING TO GRAB YOURSELF AGAIN, AREN'T YOU?

351
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,453
YOU KNOW, THAT STEFFI GRAF HAS QUITE A TUSH.

352
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,454
I'M JUST SAYING.

353
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,857
IT'S RIGHT THERE.

354
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,258
HEY, GUYS.

355
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,260
 HI, DARLING.

356
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,561
WHERE'S MY GRANDSON?

357
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,163
YOU DIDN'T BRING HIM?

358
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,565
NO, HE'S AT CAROL'S AND SUSAN'S TODAY.

359
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,968
A WOMAN IN MY OFFICE IS A LESBIAN.

360
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,271
I'M JUST SAYING.

361
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,472
OH, JACK, LOOK.

362
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,275
THERE'S THAT HOUSE PAINT COMMERCIAL

363
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,877
THAT CRACKS YOU UP.

364
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,082
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

365
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,283
EMOTIONAL HELL.

366
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,685
SO, DID THEY LEND YOU THE MONEY YET?

367
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,687
NO, BUT THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE I HAVEN'T ASKED THEM YET.

368
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,490
COME ON, MONICA, DO IT.

369
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,092
HEY, YOU GUYS.

370
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,494
UM, MONICA HAS SOME NEWS.

371
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,096
UM, YEAH, UH...

372
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:00,299
LISTEN, I'M SORRY I DIDN'T TELL YOU THIS BEFORE

373
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,502
BUT, UM, I'M NO LONGER AT MY JOB.

374
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,104
I HAD TO LEAVE IT.

375
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:05,905
WHY?

376
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,307
BECAUSE THEY MADE ME.

377
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,310
YOU WERE... FIRED?

378
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,712
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

379
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:14,914
JUDY, JUDY, RELAX.

380
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,117
THIS IS OUR LITTLE HARMONICA WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

381
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,318
WE TAUGHT HER WELL.

382
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:22,521
TEN PERCENT OF YOUR PAYCHECK-- WHERE DOES IT GO?

383
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,123
IN THE BANK. IN THE BANK.

384
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,724
THERE YOU GO. SO SHE DIPS INTO HER SAVINGS.

385
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,726
THAT'S WHAT IT'S THERE FOR.

386
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,128
SHE'S GOING TO BE FINE.

387
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,130
AREN'T YOU, SWEETIE?

388
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,731
IN THE BANK.

389
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,333
AND IF YOU NEED A LITTLE EXTRA

390
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,136
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND IT.

391
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,939
ANYTHING LARGER BACK THERE?

392
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,540
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

393
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,542
WOULD YOU STOP ALREADY?

394
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,544
GET OUT OF THE BITTER BARN

395
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,546
AND PLAY IN THE HAY.

396
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,948
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

397
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,549
I SHOULD PLAY IN THE HAY.

398
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,952
FORGET ABOUT THE FACT THAT I JUST DROPPED $400 DOLLAR

399
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,354
TO REPLACE A BRACELET THAT I HATED TO BEGIN WITH.

400
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,956
BRING ON THE HAY.

401
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,958
HEY.

402
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,559
I'VE GOT SOMETHING

403
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,962
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.

404
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,964
GUESS WHAT GUNTHER FOUND.

405
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,266
OH!

406
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,268
HEY, NOW YOU HAVE TWO.

407
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,869
OH.

408
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,571
NOW YOU HAVE TWO.

409
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,676
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO, HUH?

410
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,278
HEY.

411
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,680
HEY.

412
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,483
HOW COME YOU HAVE TWO?

413
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,686
WELL, THIS ONE'S FOR YOU.

414
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,688
GET OUT.

415
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,690
NO, I CAN'T.

416
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,492
I KNOW HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO YOU

417
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,894
AND I ALSO KNOW

418
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,797
THAT THIS IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST JEWELRY.

419
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:39,999
IT'S ABOUT YOU AND ME

420
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,401
AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE BEST BUDS.

421
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,403
WOW.

422
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,005
IS THIS FRIENDSHIP?

423
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,206
I THINK SO.

424
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,009
CHECK IT OUT.

425
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,610
WE'RE BRACELET BUDDIES.

426
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,212
THAT'S WHAT THEY'LL CALL US.

427
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,216
OKAY, HERE YOU GO.

428
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,618
YOU CAN PAY ME BACK WHENEVER YOU LIKE.

429
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,421
YOU HAVE DINOSAUR CHECKS?

430
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,723
YEAH. YEAH, I MEAN, YOU GET YOUR MONEY

431
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,725
AND YOU LEARN A LITTLE SOMETHING.

432
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,327
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

433
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,128
NOTHING. NOTHING.

434
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,930
HEY, YOU'RE A CHEAP ASAURUS.

435
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,534
I'M KIDDING. I'M KIDDING.

436
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,536
THANK YOU. I'M VERY GRATEFUL.

437
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,938
HEY, MON, WHAT IS THIS?

438
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:23,942
OH, UM, THAT WAS MY BATHING SUIT FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

439
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,944
I WAS A LITTLE BIGGER THEN.

440
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,047
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT THEY USED

441
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,648
TO COVER CONNECTICUT

442
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,150
WHEN IT RAINS.

443
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,952
HEY, MONICA, WHAT'S ON THIS VIDEOTAPE?

444
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,954
I DON'T KNOW. YOU GOT ME.

445
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,256
LET'S PUT IT IN.

446
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,658
HELLO.

447
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,260
HI.

448
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,461
HEY.

449
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,664
MMM...

450
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,066
Over here, Jack.

451
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:47,866
Okay.

452
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,369
I see Rachel's coming up the path.

453
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,771
Oh, doesn't she look pretty?

454
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,773
Jack, can you get this?

455
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,477
OH, MY GOD.

456
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,879
WHAT IS WITH YOUR NOSE?

457
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:07,286
THEY HAD TO REDUCE IT BECAUSE OF MY DEVIATED SEPTUM.

458
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,887
OKAY, I WAS WRONG.

459
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:12,491
THAT'S WHAT THEY USE TO COVER CONNECTICUT.

460
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:12,991
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

461
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,593
THIS IS US GETTING READY FOR THE PROM.

462
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,794
OH.

463
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:16,595
YOU KNOW WHAT, GUYS?

464
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,796
WE DON'T HAVE TO WATCH THIS.

465
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:18,597
YEAH, WE DO.

466
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,798
IT'LL BE FUN.

467
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,800
Did you get a shot of Monica?

468
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,901
WHERE'S MONICA?

469
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,503
OVER HERE, DAD.

470
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:29,108
 WAIT. HOW DO YOU ZOOM OUT?

471
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,510
THERE SHE IS.

472
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,814
SOME GIRL ATE MONICA.

473
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,418
SHUT UP.

474
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,820
THE CAMERA ADDS TEN POUNDS.

475
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,523
SO, HOW MANY CAMERAS ARE ACTUALLY ON YOU?

476
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,129
Oh, you look so great.

477
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,931
So do you. Beautiful.

478
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:53,732
Oops.

479
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,734
Shoot. I got mayonnaise on you.

480
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:56,935
Oh, that's okay.

481
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,338
It's just the shoulder, not my dress.

482
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,242
 EVERYBODY SMILE.

483
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,443
OH.

484
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:05,644
DAD, TURN IT OFF.

485
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,845
IT IS OFF.

486
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,046
IT IS NOT.

487
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,048
WHAT'S WITH THE RED LIGHT?

488
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,650
THAT'S THE "OFF" LIGHT.

489
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,851
RIGHT, ROSS?

490
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,061
LOOKING GOOD, MR. KOTTER.

491
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,567
YOU LOOK REALLY PRETTY TONIGHT.

492
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,169
OH, THANKS.

493
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,973
SO, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO THIS SUMMER?

494
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,177
OH, YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO HANG OUT AND WORK ON MY MUSIC.

495
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,378
OH.

496
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,981
IS MY HOOK UNHOOKED?

497
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:44,583
THESE THINGS KEEP FALLING DOWN.

498
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,185
I CAN'T...

499
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,786
KEEP THEM UP.

500
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,292
Uh, let me see.

501
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,893
I don't know.

502
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,495
So, what are you going to do...

503
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,096
Oh, the guys are here!

504
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,698
...this summer?

505
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,799
WORK ON YOUR MUSIC?

506
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,104

507
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,306
 OH, MY GOD!

508
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,907
THERE'S ROY GUBLICK!

509
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:12,411
YOU KNOW, ROY SAW STAR WARS 317 TIMES.

510
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,813
HIS NAME WAS IN THE PAPER.

511
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,016
WHERE'S CHIP?

512
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,018
WHY ISN'T HE HERE YET?

513
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,620
HE'LL BE HERE, OKAY?

514
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,222
TAKE A CHILL PILL.

515
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,823
THERE.

516
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,430
I JUST TOLD RACHEL

517
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,432
THAT ROY TOUCHED MY BOOB.

518
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,638
I CAN'T GO TO MY OWN PROM WITHOUT A DATE.

519
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,640
I CAN'T. IT'S TOO LATE.

520
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,843
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING, I DON'T WANT TO GO EITHER.

521
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,246
OH, I'M GOING TO KICK CHIP'S ASS.

522
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,250
I HAVE A WONDERFUL IDEA.

523
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,853
YOU SHOULD TAKE RACHEL TO THE PROM.

524
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,054
DOUBTFUL.

525
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,656
JACK, GIVE ME THAT.

526
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,258
TALK TO YOUR SON.

527
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,060
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

528
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,463
YOUR MOTHER'S RIGHT. TAKE HER.

529
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,064
YOU COULD WEAR MY TUX.

530
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,066
DAD, SHE WON'T WANT TO GO WITH ME.

531
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,068
Of course, she would.

532
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,670
You're a college man.

533
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,272
I DON'T KNOW.

534
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,473
WELL, COME ON.

535
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,775
DON'T YOU WANT TO FIND OUT?

536
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,976
I CAN'T BELIEVE

537
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,779
I DON'T GET TO GO TO MY OWN PROM.

538
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,180
THIS IS SO HARSH.

539
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,684
OKAY.

540
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,286
HOLD MY BOARD.

541
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,688
ATTABOY.

542
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,490
OKAY, YOU GUYS, I THINK WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH.

543
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,591
NO, NO, NO.

544
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:33,892
NO.

545
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:35,694
OKAY, FINE. WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO WATCH, ALL RIGHT?

546
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:36,895
Come on, kid.

547
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,597
LET'S GO.

548
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,200
 ARE YOU HANDSOME.

549
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,603
 LET'S SHOW THEM.

550
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,605
JUST A SEC, DAD.

551
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,206
JUST BE COOL.

552
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,808
JUST BE COOL.

553
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,619
OKAY, DAD.

554
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,220
RACHEL, READY OR NOT

555
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,324
HERE COMES YOUR KNIGHT IN SHINING...

556
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,525
OH, NO.

557
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:07,726
BYE, YOU GUYS!

558
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:08,927
DON'T WAIT UP!

559
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,129
CHIP!

560
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,431
 OH, DEAR.

561
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:15,634
JACK, HOW DO I TURN THIS OFF?

562
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,035
Press the button.

563
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,338
Which one? Which button? Jack...

564
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,139
The button. The button.

565
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,145
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THAT.

566
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,451
YEAH, WELL...

567
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:01,079
SEE?

568
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,181
HE'S HER LOBSTER.

569
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,691
 Dance with him.

570
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,993
Mom, I'm hungry.

571
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,195
Dance with your father.

572
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,598
I MAY NOT KNOW ANY OF YOUR FLASH DANCES

573
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,000
BUT I'M NO SLOUCH ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

574
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,602
ALL RIGHT.

575
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,609
OH, JACK.

576
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,010
OH, JUDY.

577
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,612
Oh, Jack.

578
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,213
Judith...

579
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,915
Oh, Judy... Yes... Yes...
