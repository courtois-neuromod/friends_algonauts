1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,003
ALL RIGHT, NO PEEKING.

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,604
NO PEEKING.

3
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:06,206
NO PEEKING. NO PEEKING!

4
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,807
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT

5
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:10,610
BUT YOU'D BETTER BE WEARING CLOTHES WHEN I OPEN MY EYES.

6
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,814
ALL RIGHT. OPEN YOUR EYES.

7
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:23,323
SWEET MOTHER OF ALL THAT IS GOOD AND PURE.

8
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,325
DAYS OF OUR LIVES PICKED UP MY OPTION.

9
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,526
CONGRATULATIONS!

10
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,528
I KNOW.

11
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,930
NOW WE CAN FINALLY WATCH GREEN ACRES

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,932
THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE SEEN.

13
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:35,235
SO, UH... WHICH ONE IS MINE?

14
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:38,438
WHICHEVER ONE YOU WANT, MAN.

15
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,040
WHICHEVER ONE YOU WANT.

16
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,643
NOT THAT ONE.

17
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:49,249
OH, YES.

18
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:52,452
OH, YEAH, THAT'S THE STUFF.

19
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,456
DO WE DARE?

20
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,858
WE DARE.

21
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,062
AH... AH...

22
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,964
AH... AH... AH... AH...

36
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,313
I CAN'T BELIEVE

37
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,415
TWO COWS MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE

38
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,018
SO YOU GUYS COULD WATCH TV WITH YOUR FEET UP.

39
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,421
THEY WERE CHAIR SHAPED COWS.

40
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:04,224
THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE SURVIVED IN THE WILD.

41
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,825
THAT SCREEN IS AMAZING.

42
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,628
DICK VAN DYKE IS PRACTICALLY LIFE SIZE.

43
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,930

44
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,334
ROSE MARIE REALLY BELONGS ON A SMALLER SCREEN, DOESN'T SHE?

45
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,935
HI, YOU GUYS.

46
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,137
HEY.

47
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,338
HEY, YOU.

48
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,039
HEY, YOU.

49
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,644
HEY, YO. WHOA, HEY.

50
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,248
SO, UH, HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

51
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,650
OH, YOU KNOW, PRETTY MUCH THE USUAL.

52
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,152
SUN SHINING, BIRDS CHIRPING.

53
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,753
REALLY? MINE, TOO.

54
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,256
HEY, COOL, MINE, TOO.

55
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,657

56
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,858
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

57
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:41,261
I GOT TO GET TO THE MUSEUM.

58
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,263
SO, UM... I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT?

59
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,564
OKAY.

60
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:48,968
OH.

61
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,971
BYE, GUYS.

62
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,573
BYE.

63
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,175
TONIGHT?

64
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,077
 HEY, YO, HEY, YO.

65
00:02:58,077 --> 00:02:59,579
WHAT'S TONIGHT?

66
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,981
IT IS OUR FIRST OFFICIAL DATE.

67
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,784
OUR FIRST DATE.

68
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:05,985
HELLO?

69
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,288
HI.

70
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,990
TONIGHT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WAITRESS FOR ME.

71
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,592
MY CATERING THING?

72
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,994
ANY OF THOSE WORDS TRIGGER ANYTHING FOR YOU?

73
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,996
GOD, OH, GOD, MONICA, I FORGOT.

74
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,198
THIS IS OUR FIRST DATE.

75
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,699
YES, BUT MY MOM GOT ME THIS JOB.

76
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,301
I CAN BE A WAITRESS. I CAN BE A WAITRESS.

77
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,303
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

78
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,504
SEE, PHOEBE, PHOEBE?

79
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,705
REALLY, PHEEBS?

80
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,508
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU'D HAVE TO BE AN ACTUAL WAITRESS.

81
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,311
THIS CAN'T BE LIKE YOUR "I CAN BE A BEAR CUB" THING.

82
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,512
I CAN BE A WAITRESS.

83
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,113
OKAY, WATCH THIS.

84
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,115
GIVE ME TWO NUMBER ONES, 86 THE BACON

85
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,918
ONE ADAM AND EVE ON A RAFT AND WRECK THEM.

86
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:42,422
? LA LA LA LA LA, LA LA LA LA LA... ?

87
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,826

88
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,834
IT'S JAMES BOND.

89
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,438
SORRY WE'RE LATE.

90
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,039
THAT'S OKAY. COME ON IN.

91
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,442
I'M SORRY, IS MONICA GELLER COMING?

92
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,043
I WAS TOLD SHE WAS.

93
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,645
DR. BURKE, IT'S ME.

94
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,646
MONICA?

95
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,147
MY GOD!

96
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:09,949
YOU USED TO BE SO...

97
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:13,152
I MEAN, YOU... YOU MUST HAVE LOST, LIKE...

98
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,655

99
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,257
YOU LOOK GREAT.

100
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,258
THANK YOU.

101
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,459
THIS IS MY FRIEND PHOEBE.

102
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,060
SHE'S GOING TO BE HELPING ME TONIGHT.

103
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,262
HI, PHOEBE. NICE TO MEET YOU.

104
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,765

105
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,367
SO HOW'VE YOU BEEN?

106
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,968
I'VE BEEN GREAT. JUST GREAT.

107
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,169
HOW'VE YOU BEEN?

108
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,572
OH, WELL, OBVIOUSLY, BARBARA AND I SPLIT UP

109
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,974
OTHERWISE, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THE HEAD TILT.

110
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,476
THE HEAD TILT?

111
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,878
YEAH. SINCE THE DIVORCE, WHEN ANYBODY ASKS ME HOW I AM

112
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,880
IT'S ALWAYS WITH A SYMPATHETIC HEAD TILT.

113
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,081
"HOW YOU DOING? YOU OKAY?"

114
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,384
I'M SORRY.

115
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,585
NO, NO. IT'S FINE.

116
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,987
BELIEVE ME, I DO IT, TOO.

117
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,390
I ALWAYS ANSWER WITH THE "I'M OKAY" HEAD BOB.

118
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,991
"I'M OKAY."

119
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,192
"YOU SURE?"

120
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,794
"YEAH, I'M FINE."

121
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,796
HEY, LISTEN, I GOT TO SET UP THE MUSIC.

122
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,997
I GOT A NEW CD CHANGER.

123
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:01,601
OF COURSE THE DIVORCE ONLY LEFT ME WITH FOUR CDs TO CHANGE.

124
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,802
OH.

125
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,003
THAT'S TOO BAD.

126
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,705
I'LL SURVIVE.

127
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,809
...to the reverse.

128
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,411
UH, TWO LARGES.

129
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,813
EXTRA CHEESE ON BOTH.

130
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,817
BUT LISTEN, DON'T RING THE BUZZER FOR 19.

131
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:21,020
RING 20-- GELLER/GREEN.

132
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,623
THEY'LL LET YOU IN, OKAY?

133
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:30,430
IF YOU BUZZ OUR DOOR, THERE'S NO TIP FOR YOU.

134
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,631
OKAY, THANKS.

135
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,832

136
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,834
PIZZA'S ON THE WAY.

137
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,438
I TOLD YOU WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO GET UP.

138
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,240
WHAT IF WE HAVE TO PEE?

139
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,645
I'LL CANCEL THE SODAS.

140
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,851
YOU'VE GOT TO GET BACK OUT THERE.

141
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,652
IT'S YOUR PARTY.

142
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:53,853
BUT THEY'RE SO DULL.

143
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,455
THEY'RE ALL OPHTHALMOLOGISTS.

144
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,256
YOU'RE AN OPHTHALMOLOGIST.

145
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,559
ONLY BECAUSE MY PARENTS WANTED ME TO BE.

146
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,760
I WANTED TO BE A SHERIFF.

147
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,162

148
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:03,963
THAT'S FUNNY.

149
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,164
CADILLAC-- CATARACT.

150
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,366
I GET IT. NO, I GET IT.

151
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,768
YOU STAY OUT THERE!

152
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:09,969
YOU SEE?

153
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,170
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

154
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,172
I'LL COME GET YOU IN FIVE MINUTES

155
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,575
WITH SOME SORT OF, UM... KABOB EMERGENCY.

156
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,376
OKAY.

157
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,277
OH... YOU BETTER.

158
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:21,080
OH, GOD, HERE WE GO.

159
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,082
HEY, WANT TO SEE THEM GO NUTS?

160
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,084
WATCH THIS.

161
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,086
WHO NEEDS GLASSES?

162
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:30,690

163
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,095
YOU ARE SO SMITTEN.

164
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,097
I AM NOT.

165
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:41,000
OH, YOU ARE SO MUCH THE SMITTEN KITTEN.

166
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,704
YOU SHOULD ASK HIM OUT.

167
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,106
DR. BURKE? I DON'T THINK SO.

168
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,909
I MEAN, LIKE, HE'S A GROWNUP.

169
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,411
SO?

170
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,813
YOU TWO ARE TOTALLY INTO EACH OTHER.

171
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,214
PHOEBE, HE'S A FRIEND OF MY PARENTS'.

172
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,617
HE'S, LIKE, 20 YEARS OLDER THAN ME.

173
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,719
OKAY, SO WHAT, YOU'RE JUST NEVER GOING TO SEE HIM AGAIN?

174
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,721
NOT NEVER.

175
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:06,526
I MEAN, I'M GOING TO SEE HIM TOMORROW AT MY EYE APPOINTMENT.

176
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,728
DIDN'T YOU, LIKE, JUST GET YOUR EYES CHECKED?

177
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:14,834
WELL, YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW, 27 IS A... DANGEROUS EYE AGE.

178
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:19,038
THEY'RE PICKING TEAMS TO PLAY "GUESS MY PRESCRIPTION."

179
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,239
HELP ME!

180
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,747
COME ON, I'M NOT SAYING IT WAS A BAD MOVIE.

181
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,149
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU KNOW, IT WAS A LITTLE...

182
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,350
HARD TO FOLLOW.

183
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,554
I TOLD YOU THERE WERE GOING TO BE SUBTITLES.

184
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,155
I KNOW.

185
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:40,159
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO WEAR MY GLASSES ON OUR FIRST DATE.

186
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,761
OH.

187
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,769
MONICA?

188
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,373
IT WOULD REALLY HELP WHEN I'M KISSING YOU

189
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,176
IF YOU DIDN'T SHOUT OUT MY SISTER'S NAME.

190
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,679
HONEY, I'M JUST CHECKING.

191
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,880
OH. MONICA?

192
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,482
MON?

193
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,282
MONICA? MON?

194
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,884
MONICA?

195
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,007

196
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,614
WHAT?

197
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:35,815
WHAT?

198
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,416
I'M SORRY. OH, GOD, I'M SORRY.

199
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,219
IT'S JUST THAT WHEN YOU MOVED YOUR HANDS DOWN TO MY BUTT

200
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,022
IT WAS LIKE, "WHOA, ROSS'S HANDS ARE ON MY BUTT."

201
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,725
SORRY.

202
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,528
AND THAT'S, THAT'S FUNNY... WHY?

203
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,329
WELL, IT'S NOT.

204
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,331
I... I MEAN, I'M SORRY.

205
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,333
I GUESS I'M JUST NERVOUS.

206
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,335
I MEAN, IT'S YOU.

207
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:57,937
YOU KNOW, IT'S US.

208
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,939
I MEAN, WE'RE CROSSING THAT LINE.

209
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,941
IT'S SORT OF A BIG THING.

210
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,342
WELL, I KNOW IT'S BIG.

211
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,745
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS... HA HA BIG.

212
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:06,946
OKAY.

213
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,456

214
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,660
OKAY, MY HANDS WERE NOWHERE NEAR YOUR BUTT.

215
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,662
I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.

216
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,764
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT WHEN THEY WERE THERE

217
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:25,965
THE LAST TIME, I'M SORRY.

218
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,166
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

219
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,768
OKAY, LOOK, WHOA. I PROMISE

220
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,570
I'M GOOD, I'M NOT GOING TO LAUGH ANYMORE.

221
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,771
OKAY, PUT YOUR HANDS BACK ON.

222
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:35,374
NO. SEE, NOW, NOW I CAN'T BECAUSE, UH...

223
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,476
I'M FEELING TOO SELF CONSCIOUS.

224
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,678
COME ON, TOUCH MY BUTT.

225
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,279
NO.

226
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,281
JUST ONE CHEEK.

227
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,883
THE MOMENT'S GONE.

228
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,185
PUT YOUR HANDS OUT, AND I'LL BACK UP INTO THEM.

229
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,386
THAT'S ROMANTIC.

230
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,788
 COME ON, TOUCH IT.   NO.

231
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,389
OH, COME ON, SQUEEZE IT. NO.

232
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,991
RUB IT? NO.

233
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,393
OH, COME ON, WOULD YOU JUST GRAB MY ASS?!

234
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,101
WOW, LOOK AT THAT.

235
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,103
THE CAR IS ON FIRE

236
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,707
YET SOMEHOW, ITS EXPENSIVE PAINT JOB

237
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:11,310
IS PROTECTED BY THE MIRACLE WAX.

238
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,713
YOU KNOW?

239
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,915
YOU GOT A CHEETO ON YOUR FACE, MAN.

240
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,120

241
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,722
THANKS.

242
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,123
HEY.

243
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,324
HEY.

244
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,125
HEY.

245
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,727
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

246
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,729
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE OUT WITH RACHEL?

247
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:33,132
THAT WAS 14 HOURS AGO.

248
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,536
WHOA, WE GOT TO SET THE CLOCK ON THIS THING.

249
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,939
SO HOW'D IT GO?

250
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,941
OH... LISTEN, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN

251
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,744
YOU KNOW, FOOLING AROUND WITH A GIRL

252
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:48,347
AND, UH... SHE STARTED LAUGHING?

253
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,750
YEAH, BUT, UH, IT WAS 1982

254
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,953
AND MY FLOCK OF SEAGULLS HAIRCUT

255
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,355
WAS TICKLING HER CHIN.

256
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,060
SHE LAUGHED AT YOU?

257
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,261
YEAH. IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.

258
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,263
I COULD HAVE BEEN NAKED.

259
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,969
I'VE JUST... I'VE WAITED...

260
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,572
I'VE BEEN WANTING THIS SINCE, LIKE, NINTH GRADE TYPING

261
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:18,377
AND I JUST WANT IT TO BE PERFECT AND... RIGHT AND...

262
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:22,782
WHY ISN'T THAT LASER BEAM CUTTING THROUGH THE PAINT?

263
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:23,983
IT'S THE MIRACLE WAX.

264
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,985
IT CERTAINLY IS A MIRACLE.

265
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,687
HI, YOU GUYS.

266
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,988
HEY. HEY.

267
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,189
HEY.

268
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,392
HI. LISTEN, I WAS, UM, THINKING ABOUT...

269
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,994
CAN YOU GUYS SPEAK UP?

270
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,996
IT'S HARDER FOR US TO HEAR YOU

271
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,398
WHEN YOU LOWER YOUR VOICE.

272
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,000
HALLWAY?

273
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,601
YEAH.

274
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,807
OKAY, LISTEN, I'M SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT

275
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:51,010
AND I REALLY WANT TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

276
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:55,314
NO. YOU... YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO NEED TO MAKE IT... HOW?

277
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:58,117
WELL, I WAS THINKING MAYBE A, UM...

278
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,719

279
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,322
...A ROMANTIC DINNER WITH, UM, CANDLES AND WINE

280
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:08,127
AND THEN, UM, MAYBE GOING BACK TO MY PLACE FOR, UM...

281
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,129
DESSERT.

282
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:14,934
HMM. THAT SOUNDS... I DON'T KNOW... PERFECT.

283
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,938

284
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,643
WHAT'S THIS?

285
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,747
CAN YOU GET US A COUPLE OF BEERS?

286
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,054
I'M GOING TO LOOK INTO YOUR EYES NOW.

287
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,655
REALLY?

288
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,657
YEAH. THAT'S MY JOB.

289
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,760
ALL RIGHT.

290
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,562
LOOK UP.

291
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,164
LOOK DOWN.

292
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,566
NOW OPEN YOUR EYES AND LOOK DOWN.

293
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,168
THAT'S RIGHT.

294
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,570
LOOK INTO THE LIGHT.

295
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,973
NOW LOOK AT ME.

296
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,182
OKAY.

297
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,786
YOUR EYES LOOK GOOD.

298
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,788
THOSE ARE GOOD EYES.

299
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,790
GOOD. THEY FEEL GOOD.

300
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,792
IN MY HEAD.

301
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,194
OH. UH...

302
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,996
SO...

303
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,998
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

304
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,100
YOU, TOO.

305
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,601

00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,305
OKAY. UM...

GOOD BYE.

308
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,610
DROPS.

309
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,012
WHAT?

310
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,014
DROPS. HERE. THEY'RE FREE.

311
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,418
THANKS.

312
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:42,221
SO, I GUESS I'D BETTER BE GOING.

313
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,223
OH, OKAY. YEAH. I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

314
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,825
OH, THANKS AGAIN.

315
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,426
OH, UH...

316
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,641
WE HAVE GOT TO GET YOU LAZY BOYS OUT OF THESE CHAIRS.

317
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,643
 HEY, WHOA, HEY, WHOA!

00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,649
AND BE WITH THE THREE DIMENSIONAL PEOPLE.

320
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,251
NO.

321
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,653
INSIDE GOOD.

322
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,655
OUTSIDE BAD.

323
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,859
YOU GUYS ARE SO PATHETIC.

324
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,861
OH! OH,XANADU!

325
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,964

00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,368
HI, YOU GUYS.

328
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,169
HEY.

329
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,871

 GOOD NIGHT.

00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:40,379
LOOK AT THAT. THEY WON'T EVEN TURN THEIR HEADS.

333
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,182
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS, I'M TAKING OFF MY SHIRT.

334
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,890
NAH, SHE'S LYING.

00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:57,396
STOP SENDING FOOD TO OUR APARTMENT.

336
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,998
WHY ARE YOU ALL DRESSED UP?

337
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,400
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS A DATE TONIGHT.

338
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,002
WELL, YOU HAVE A DATE? WHO WITH?

339
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:03,802
NO ONE.

340
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,404
COME ON, WHAT'S HIS NAME?

341
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,006
NOTHING.

342
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,008
COME ON, TELL ME.

343
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,810
ALL RIGHT, BUT I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

344
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,812
SO YOU GOT TO PROMISE YOU WON'T GET

345
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,015
ALL BIG BROTHERY AND JUDGMENTAL.

346
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,216
I PROMISE. WHAT?

347
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,317
IT'S RICHARD BURKE.

348
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,919
WHO'S RICHARD BURKE?

349
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,520
DOC..? DR. BURKE?

350
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,023
YOU HAVE A DATE WITH DR. BURKE?

351
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:28,427
WHY? WHY? WHY... SHOULD THAT BOTHER ME?

352
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,029
I I LOVE THAT MAN.

353
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,531
HE'S LIKE A... A BROTHER TO DAD.

354
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,533
OH.

355
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,936
HERE WE GO.

356
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,939
WHAT? NO, I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT HE'S, LIKE, 50.

357
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,542
I MEAN, HE'LL BE AN INSPIRATION TO MEN WHO ARE ALMOST RETIRED

358
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,743
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

359
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,245
WELL, FOR YOUR INFORMATION

360
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,247
HE HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST

361
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,050
MOST SOPHISTICATED, SEXIEST MEN I'VE EVER BEEN WITH.

362
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,551
DR. BURKE IS SEXY?

363
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,154
OH, GOD. ABSOLUTELY.

364
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,156

365
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,357
DAMN.

366
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,959
IT'S THE MUSEUM AGAIN.

367
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,160
CAN I..? OH.

368
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,063
YOU KNOW, DR. BURKE KISSED ME ONCE.

369
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,065
WHEN?

370
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,666
WHEN I WAS SEVEN, I CRASHED MY BIKE

371
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,268
RIGHT OUT IN FRONT OF HIS HOUSE

372
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,270
AND TO STOP ME FROM CRYING, HE KISSED ME

373
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,771
RIGHT HERE.

374
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,174
OH, YOU ARE SO LUCKY.

375
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,375
 I KNOW.

376
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,977
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

377
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,779
AUSTRALOPITHECUS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE IN THAT DISPLAY. NO.

378
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,381
NO. NO. NO.

379
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:23,983
HOMO HABILIS WAS ERECT.

380
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,785
AUSTRALOPITHECUS WAS NEVER FULLY ERECT.

381
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,988
WELL, MAYBE HE WAS NERVOUS.

382
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,197
LOOK. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. LOOK...

383
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:41,000
HOMO HABILIS HASN'T EVEN LEARNED HOW TO USE TOOLS YET

384
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,402
AND THEY'VE GOT HIM HERE WITH CLAY POTS?

385
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,605
WHY DON'T THEY JUST GIVE HIM A MICROWAVE?

386
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:47,906
WELL, CLEARLY, HONEY

387
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,908
HE'D HAVE NO PLACE TO PLUG IT IN.

388
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,512
SORRY.

389
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,114
I'M SORRY.

390
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,116
I'M SORRY THIS IS TAKING SO LONG.

391
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,918
YOU KNOW, I, I... IT'S LONGER THAN I EXPECTED.

392
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,120
WE WILL HAVE DINNER, OKAY?

393
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,321
IT'S OKAY. IT'S FINE.

394
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,222
CARL?

395
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,626

396
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,041
OH, WOW, IS THAT MICHELLE?

397
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,242
YEP.

398
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,045
I'VE NOT SEEN HER SINCE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION.

399
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,248
OH, MY GOD, THAT NIGHT SHE GOT SO DRUN...

400
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,451
...MOTIONAL.

401
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,853
YOU KNOW, SHE'S HAVING ANOTHER BABY.

402
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,855
I THOUGHT SHE JUST HAD ONE.

403
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,658
NO, NO. HENRY'S ALMOST TWO.

404
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,660
HE'S TALKING AND EVERYTHING.

405
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:42,861
HERE.

406
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,463
AW...

407
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,266
YOU KNOW, THE OTHER DAY HE TOLD ME HE LIKED ME BETTER

408
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,867
THAN HIS OTHER GRANDPA.

409
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,469
NOW, IN ALL FAIRNESS

410
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,871
HIS OTHER GRANDPA'S A DRUNK, BUT STILL...

411
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,674
OH. YOU'RE A GRANDPA?

412
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,079
YEAH.

413
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,286
ARE WE NUTS HERE?

414
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,887
I DON'T KNOW.

415
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,089
MAYBE.

416
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:14,893
I MEAN, I'M DATING A MAN WHOSE POOL I ONCE PEED IN.

417
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,895
I DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW THAT.

418
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:20,499
I GUESS 21 YEARS IS A LOT.

419
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,901
I MEAN, HELL, I'M A...

420
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:26,105
WHOLE PERSON WHO CAN DRINK OLDER THAN YOU.

421
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,507
YEAH.

422
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,911

00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:38,517
SO, MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST...

424
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,718

00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,521
YEAH, MAYBE.

426
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,927
WOW.

00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,531
THIS REALLY SUCKS.

428
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,733
YEAH. IT SURE DOES.

429
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,536
AH...

430
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,954
WELL, WE DON'T REALLY HAVE TO DECIDE ANYTHING RIGHT NOW, DO WE?

431
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,757
NO. NO, THERE'S NO RUSH OR ANYTHING.

432
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:19,558

433
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,759
 PIZZA DELIVERY!

434
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,562
OH, I'M GOING TO KILL THOSE GUYS.

435
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,365

OKAY. I'M SORRY.

00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,176
LET'S... WHY DON'T WE FIND SOMEPLACE ELSE?

442
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,178
YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S LATE. EVERYTHING'S GONNA CLOSED.

443
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,779
WHY DON'T WE DO IT ANOTHER NIGHT?

444
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,080
NO. NO, WE WON'T.

445
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,682

451
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,693
SHH. DO YOU WANT CRAN APPLE OR CRAN GRAPE?

452
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,894

00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,896

HEY, YOU.

499
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:36,855
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M WAKING UP NEXT TO YOU.

500
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,558
I KNOW, IT IS PRETTY UNBELIEVABLE...

501
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,560
 WHAT?

502
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,262
WE'RE NOT ALONE.
