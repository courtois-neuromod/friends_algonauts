1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:03,403
MOM, WOULD YOU RELAX?

2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,405
THAT WAS TEN BLOCKS FROM HERE

3
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:07,807
AND THE WOMAN WAS WALKING ALONE AT NIGHT.

4
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,809
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

5
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,212
MOM, COME ON, STOP WORRYING.

6
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,214
THIS IS A SAFE STREET.

7
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,415
THIS IS A SAFE BUILDING.

8
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,017
THERE'S NOTHING... OH, MY GOD!

9
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,119
OH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?!

10
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,420
OH, GOD, MOM, I GOT TO GO!

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,022
I GOT TO GO.

12
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,223

13
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,824
OH, MY GOD.

14
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:26,426
OKAY.

15
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:27,627
THAT'S FINE.

16
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,229
YOU JUST READ THE PAPER.

17
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:32,232
I'M GOING TO GET A POT.

18
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,833
IT'S NOT FOR YOU.

19
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:41,841
OKAY, THAT'S FINE.

20
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:46,146
READ "THE FAMILY CIRCUS."

21
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,848
ENJOY THE GENTLE COMEDY.

22
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:52,852

23
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,054
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

24
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:54,854
OH, MY GOD.

25
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,456
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

26
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,657
OH, MY GOD.

27
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:58,858

28
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,064
OH, MY GOD... OH, GOD... OH... OH...

29
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:05,665

30
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,667
IT'S OPEN, YOU GUYS.

31
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,569
HI.

32
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,271
HI. HEY, CAN I HELP YOU?

33
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,472
YEAH, I'M LOOKING FOR PHOEBE.

34
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,673
DOES SHE STILL LIVE HERE?

35
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:14,474
UH, NO, SHE DOESN'T

36
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,076
BUT I CAN GET A MESSAGE TO HER.

37
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,179
GREAT. JUST TELL HER HER HUSBAND STOPPED BY.

38
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,280
HER WHAT?

39
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,884
HEY, HOW... HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

53
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,036
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE, PHEEBS.

54
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:18,638
HOW CAN YOU BE MARRIED?

55
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,940
WELL, I'M NOT MARRIED MARRIED.

56
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,942
HE WAS JUST A FRIEND, AND HE'S GAY

57
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,745
AND HE'S FROM CANADA, AND HE JUST NEEDED A GREEN CARD.

58
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,747
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU MARRIED DUNCAN.

59
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,349
I MEAN, HOW COULD YOU NOT TELL ME?

60
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,150
WE LIVED TOGETHER.

61
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,152
WE TOLD EACH OTHER EVERYTHING.

62
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,154
I'M SORRY, MONICA, BUT I KNEW IF I TOLD YOU

63
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,755
YOU'D GET REALLY, LIKE, JUDGMENTAL

64
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:36,956
AND YOU WOULD NOT APPROVE.

65
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,558
OF COURSE I WOULDN'T APPROVE.

66
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,560
I MEAN, YOU WERE TOTALLY IN LOVE

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,962
WITH THIS GUY WHO-- HELLO-- WAS GAY.

68
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,564
I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING?

69
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,566
SEE, AND YOU THOUGHT SHE'D BE JUDGMENTAL.

70
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,568
OKAY, I WASN'T "IN LOVE"

71
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:51,671
WITH HIM, AND I WAS JUST HELPING OUT A FRIEND.

72
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,273
PLEASE.

73
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,075
WHEN HE LEFT TOWN, YOU STAYED IN YOUR PAJAMAS FOR A MONTH

74
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,677
AND I SAW YOU EAT A CHEESEBURGER.

75
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,980

76
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,682
WELL, DIDN'T YOU?

77
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,584
I MIGHT HAVE.

78
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,587
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

79
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,989
OH, COME ON. LIKE YOU TELL ME EVERYTHING?

80
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,691
WHAT HAVE I NOT TOLD YOU?

81
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,493
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

82
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,694
UM, HOW ABOUT THE FACT

83
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,497
THAT THE UNDERWEAR OUT THERE ON THE TELEPHONE POLE IS YOURS

84
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,899
FROM WHEN YOU WERE HAVING SEX WITH FUN BOBBY

85
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,100
OUT ON THE TERRACE.

86
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,102
WHAT?!

87
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,804
WAIT A MINUTE... WHO TOLD YOU?

88
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,810
YOU ARE DEAD MEAT.

89
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,213
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A BIG SECRET.

90
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,814
OH, IT'S NOT BIG, NOT AT ALL.

91
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,017
YOU KNOW, KIND OF ON THE SAME LINES AS, SAY

92
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,819
OH, I DON'T KNOW, HAVING A THIRD NIPPLE!

93
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:40,620

94
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,725
YOU HAVE A THIRD NIPPLE?

95
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,828
YOU BITCH.

96
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,832
WHIP IT OUT! WHIP IT OUT!

97
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:53,833
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

98
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:54,634
COME ON.

99
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:55,835
THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE.

100
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,036
IT'S JUST A TINY BUMP.

101
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,238
IT'S TOTALLY USELESS.

102
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,440
OH, AS OPPOSED TO YOUR OTHER

103
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,442
MULTIFUNCTIONAL NIPPLES.

104
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,043
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

105
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,045
YOU TOLD ME IT WAS A NUBBIN.

106
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,249
JOEY, WHAT DID YOU THINK A NUBBIN WAS?

107
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,049
I DON'T KNOW.

108
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,251
YOU SEE SOMETHING.

109
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,051
YOU HEAR A WORD.

110
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,053
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.

111
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:16,155
LET ME SEE IT AGAIN.

112
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,757
YEAH, SHOW IT TO US.

113
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,958

114
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,760
JOEY WAS IN A PORNO MOVIE.

115
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,362

116
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:27,166
IF I'M GOING DOWN, I'M TAKING EVERYBODY WITH ME.

117
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,368
OH, MY GOD!

118
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,569
A PORNO MOVIE?

119
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,170
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

120
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,573
I WAS YOUNG, AND I JUST WANTED A JOB, OKAY?

121
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,975
BUT, AT THE LAST MINUTE, I COULDN'T GO THROUGH WITH IT

122
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,778
SO THEY LET ME BE THE GUY WHO COMES IN TO FIX THE COPIER

123
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,180
BUT CAN'T, BECAUSE THERE'S PEOPLE HAVING SEX ON IT.

124
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,884
THAT IS WILD!

125
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,185

126
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,287
SO WHAT'S IT SHAPED LIKE?

127
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:48,488
IS THERE A HAIR ON IT?

128
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,089
WHAT HAPPENS

129
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,091
IF YOU FLICK IT?

130
00:04:56,896 --> 00:05:01,301
SO, UH, DOES IT DO ANYTHING, YOU KNOW, SPECIAL?

131
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,902
WELL, YES, ROSS.

132
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:06,506
PRESSING MY THIRD NIPPLE OPENS THE DELIVERY ENTRANCE

133
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,908
TO THE MAGICAL LAND OF NARNIA.

134
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,811
YOU KNOW, IN SOME CULTURES, HAVING A THIRD NIPPLE

135
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,413
IS ACTUALLY A SIGN OF VIRILITY.

136
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,614
YOU GET THE BEST HUTS

137
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,616
AND WOMEN DANCE NAKED AROUND YOU.

138
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:20,219
HUH. ARE ANY OF THESE CULTURES PERCHANCE IN THE TRISTATE AREA?

139
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:23,423
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE SO AMAZING.

140
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,225
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU DON'T KNOW?

141
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,629
OOH, JULIE'S SO SMART.

142
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,230
JULIE'S SO SPECIAL.

143
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,934
WHAT, DOES SHE GO PUT AN OUTFIT ON AT NIGHT

144
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,135
AND GO OUT AND FIGHT CRIME?

145
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,938
LOOK, HONEY, I WANTED YOU TO HOOK UP WITH ROSS

146
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,940
AS MUCH AS YOU DID, BUT HE'S WITH HER NOW.

147
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,343
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO GET OVER IT.

148
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,745
OH, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET OVER IT.

149
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,147
GOD, SEE, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT'S WHAT I HAD TO DO.

150
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,149
I JUST HAVE TO GET OVER IT.

151
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,351
OH! I'M GOING

152
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,453
TO HAVE TO WRITE THAT DOWN ON MY HAND.

153
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,457
WHOA!

154
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,659
FOXY LADY!

155
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,860
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

156
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,762
I'M GOING TO GO MEET DUNCAN.

157
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,364
HE'S SKATING TONIGHT AT THE GARDEN.

158
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,965
HE'S IN THE CAPADES.

159
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,068
THE ICE CAPADES?

160
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,770
NO, NO. THE GRAVEL CAPADES.

161
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,475
YEAH, THE TURNS AREN'T AS FAST, BUT WHEN SNOOPY FALLS-- FUNNY.

162
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,379
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE DRESSING UP FOR HIM.

163
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,781
YOU'RE SETTING YOURSELF UP ALL OVER AGAIN.

164
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:22,982
OKAY, NO.

165
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:26,185
FOR YOUR INFORMATION, I'M GOING TO SEE HIM

166
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,988
SO I CAN PUT ALL THOSE FEELINGS BEHIND ME, OKAY?

167
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,089
AND THE REASON

168
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,091
I'M DRESSED LIKE THIS

169
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:35,294
IS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S NICE TO LOOK NICE

170
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:36,896
FOR YOUR GAY HUSBAND.

171
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,699
OH, DARN IT, WE'RE ALL OUT OF MILK.

172
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,300
HEY, CHANDLER

173
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,203
WILL YOU FILL ME UP HERE?

174
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:52,412
OH, I SEE... I SEE... BECAUSE OF THE THIRD NIPPLE THING.

175
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,814

176
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,721
OKAY, SWEETIE, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

177
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,022
BYE.

178
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:03,823
BYE.

179
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,024
SEE YOU LATER, RACH.

180
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,026
BYE BYE, JULIE.

181
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,034
HEY!

182
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,036
HEY.

183
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:20,540
HEY, COME ON, CUT IT OUT.

184
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,741
HEY...

185
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:22,542
WHAT?

186
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,544
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

187
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,045
SURE.

188
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,647

189
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:28,848
WHAT?

190
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,049

191
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,451
COME ON, TALK TO ME.

192
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,652
OKAY.

193
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,654
WHAT'S THE LONGEST

194
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:38,157
YOU'VE BEEN IN A RELATIONSHIP BEFORE...

195
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,960
HA HAVING...?

196
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,562
HAVING HAD SEX?

197
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,163
WHY? WHO'S NOT HAVING...?

00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,374
WOW.

203
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,578
IS IT BECAUSE SHE'S SO COLD IN BED?

204
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,380
OR IS IT BECAUSE SHE'S

205
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,082

206
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,485

214
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,001
IT'S JUST... IT'S... IT'S ME.

215
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,804
YOU KNOW, I'VE ONLY BEEN WITH ONE WOMAN

216
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:28,407
MY WHOLE LIFE, AND SHE TURNED OUT TO BE A LESBIAN.

00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,209

NO. NO, NO, NO, I DON'T THINK IT'S WEIRD.

00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,333
I THINK IT'S SEXY.

00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,736
SEXY?

227
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,337

228
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:59,539

231
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,545
WHO DOES NOT WANT TO HAVE SEX.

232
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,847
NO KIDDING?

233
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,249
OH, YEAH. IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT I'D DO?

234
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:11,250

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,451
I'D WAIT.

236
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,053
YOU'D WAIT?

237
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,555

00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,967
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH SHE TELLS YOU SHE WANTS IT.

244
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,770
I DON'T CARE IF SHE BEGS, SHE PLEADS, SHE TELLS YOU

245
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,573
SHE'S GOING TO HAVE SEX WITH... WITH ANOTHER MAN.

246
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,174
THAT JUST MEANS IT'S WORKING.

247
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,979
WOMEN REALLY WANT THIS?

248
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,782

303
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,814
SO I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID

304
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,415

00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,892
I'VE EVER SEEN.

335
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,594

00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,305
I CAN'T GET TO THE COPIER.

342
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,909
I'M THINKING, "WHAT DO I DO? WHAT DO I DO?"

343
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,311

00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,266
I'M STRAIGHT.

365
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,168

BUT YOU JUST REACH A POINT WHERE YOU CAN'T

375
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,787

376
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,190
SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN?

377
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:56,395
WELL, I GUESS ON SOME LEVEL I ALWAYS KNEW I WAS STRAIGHT.

378
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,796
I THOUGHT I WAS SUPPOSED

379
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,398
TO BE SOMETHING ELSE.

380
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,000
YOU KNOW, I'M AN ICE DANCER.

381
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,601

382
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,004
I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIT IN.

383
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,406
AND, UM...

384
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,209
AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A... A WOMAN?

385
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,511
HER NAME'S DEBORAH.

386
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:13,512
OH.

387
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:18,717
WELL, IS... IS SHE THE FIRST THAT YOU'VE BEEN WITH?

388
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,522
WELL, I'VE NEVER TOLD YOU THIS, BUT...

389
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,325
THERE WERE ONE OR TWO TIMES BACK IN COLLEGE

390
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,528
WHEN I'D GET REALLY DRUNK, GO TO A STRAIGHT BAR

391
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,931
AND WAKE UP WITH A WOMAN NEXT TO ME.

392
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,532
BUT, I, I...

393
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,434
I TOLD MYSELF IT WAS THE LIQUOR

394
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,237
AND EVERYONE EXPERIMENTS IN COLLEGE.

395
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,438
SURE.

396
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,639
BUT NOW

397
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,641
I KNOW I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE ABOUT THIS.

398
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,243
I WAS BORN THIS WAY.

399
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,648
I, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

400
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,250
I MEAN, YOU KNOW

401
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,652
YOU'RE MARRIED TO SOMEONE FOR SIX YEARS

402
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:54,954
AND YOU THINK YOU KNOW HIM

403
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,157
AND THEN ONE DAY HE SAYS, "OH, I'M NOT GAY."

404
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:05,364
I'M... I'M STILL ME.

405
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:08,567
WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST HAVE FIGURED THIS OUT

406
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,569
SIX YEARS AGO?

407
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:16,075
YOU KNOW, IT STILL SMELLS LIKE MONKEY IN THERE?

408
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,879
WELL, THAT SAVES US A CONVERSATION.

409
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,282
WELL, LISTEN, THIS HAS BEEN GREAT

410
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,284
BUT I'M OFFICIALLY WIPED.

411
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,685
ME, TOO. WE SHOULD GET GOING.

412
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:27,486
NO!

413
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,088
NO, I MEAN... NO.

414
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,289
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

415
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:31,590
I MEAN...

416
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,692
COME ON. LOOK, IT'S ONLY 11:30.

417
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,294
LET'S JUST TALK.

418
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,097
WE NEVER JUST HANG OUT AND TALK ANYMORE.

419
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,298
RACHEL

420
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,300
THAT'S ALL WE DO.

421
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,902
OKAY, MAYBE THAT'S ALL WE DO.

422
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,504
WHAT ABOUT JULIE?

423
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,707
WHAT ABOUT JULIE?

424
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,809
WELL, YOU HAVE BEEN IN OUR LIVES

425
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,811
FOR NEARLY TWO MONTHS NOW

426
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,014
AND WE DON'T REALLY KNOW YOU.

427
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,016
I MEAN, WHO IS JULIE?

428
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,917
I MEAN

429
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,119
WHAT DO YOU LIKE?

430
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,720
WHAT DON'T YOU LIKE?

431
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,322
WE WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

432
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,424
WELL, THAT COULD TAKE A WHILE.

433
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,826
SO?

434
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,229
I MEAN, WHO HERE DOES NOT HAVE THE TIME

435
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,430
TO GET TO KNOW JULIE?

436
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,032
I GOT THE TIME TO GET TO KNOW JULIE.

437
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,933
I GOT TIME.

438
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:15,834
UH, RACH?

439
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,836
I KNOW HER PRETTY WELL.

440
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,038
CAN I GO?

441
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,342
THAT'S FINE.

442
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,345
OKAY, JULIE, SO NOW LET'S START WITH YOUR CHILDHOOD.

443
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,746
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?

444
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,348
WELL, IN A NUTSHELL...

445
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,750
UH, UH, UH, UH.

446
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,555
SO, UM, HAVE YOU TOLD YOUR PARENTS?

447
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,557
NO, BUT IT'LL BE OKAY.

448
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,559
THEY'RE PRETTY COOL.

449
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,961
MY BROTHER'S STRAIGHT, SO...

450
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,763
HERE YOU GO.

451
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,365
YOU KNOW WHAT?

452
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,367
I JUST HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION.

453
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,170
UM, IF YOU HAD FIGURED THIS OUT SOONER

454
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,771
AND, UM... I HAD BEEN AROUND

455
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,373
DO YOU THINK THAT

456
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,775
I WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONE WHO...?

457
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,377
NO, NO. THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

458
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,978
DON'T TELL ME.

459
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,781
I DON'T THINK EITHER ANSWER WOULD MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

460
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:03,982
HERE.

461
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,486
I LOVE YOU, PHOEBE.

462
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,203
SO YOUR BROTHER'S STRAIGHT, HUH?

463
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,806
SERIOUSLY.

464
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:34,313
AND MY SECOND GRADE TEACHER WAS MISS THOMAS.

465
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,516
AND MY FIRST GRADE TEACHER WAS MRS. COBB.

466
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,618
MRS.... MRS. GOB?

467
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,819
NO, COBB.

468
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,020
LIKE COBB SALAD.

469
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,123
HMM. OKAY.

470
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,726
NOW, WHAT EXACTLY IS IN A COBB SALAD?

471
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,328
I'M GOING HOME.

472
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,929
WHY?

473
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,735
THAT JULIE'S A TALKER, HUH?

474
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,339
GOOD NIGHT.

475
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,940
WHEW!

476
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,741
GOOD NIGHT.

477
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:03,942
GOOD NIGHT.

478
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,144
IT'S PRETTY LATE.

479
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,945
YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT STILL PLANNING ON...

480
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,947
OH... NO, NO, I AM.

481
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,549
OH. OH, WELL...

482
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,951
OH, HEY, ARE YOU NERVOUS?

483
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,153
NO.

484
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,354
NO, I, UH...

485
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,356
I HAVE DONE IT BEFORE.

486
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,957
WELL, OKAY, I MEAN...

487
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,959
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HANDLE IT?

488
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,362
ARE YOU GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND?

489
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,364
ARE YOU JUST GOING TO POUNCE?

490
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,965
I, UH... I DON'T KNOW.

491
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,368
I GUESS I'M JUST GOING TO...

492
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,770
SEE... SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

493
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,971
OKAY.

494
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,573
GOOD LUCK.

495
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:35,774
WHAT, UH...?

496
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:36,975

497
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:38,177
WHAT?

498
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,378
WELL, NOTHING.

499
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,979
I MEAN, UM...

500
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,981
IT IS YOUR FIRST TIME WITH HER

501
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:44,183
AND, YOU KNOW

502
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,585
IF THE FIRST TIME DOESN'T GO WELL

503
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,987
WELL, THEN, THAT'S PRETTY DARN HARD

504
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,989
TO RECOVER FROM.

505
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,593
OKAY, NOW I'M NERVOUS.

506
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,797
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD PUT IT OFF.

507
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,799
NO, I DON'T WANT TO PUT IT OFF.

508
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,000
I...

509
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,604
GOD, I'M JUST...

510
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:09,208
I SPENT LAST YEAR BEING SO UNBELIEVABLY MISERABLE.

511
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,811
AND NOW, NOW... I'M ACTUALLY HAPPY.

512
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:16,815
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, REALLY HAPPY.

513
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,116
I JUST, I JUST...

514
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,318
DON'T WANT TO...

515
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,320
I DON'T WANT TO MESS IT UP.

516
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,921
YOU KNOW?

517
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:26,124
I KNOW.

518
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,126
YEAH.

519
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,328
I'M SORRY.

520
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,529
NO, IT'S...

521
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,531
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

522
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:33,732
RIGHT.

523
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,937
MAYBE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS TOUGH.

524
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,939
MAYBE YOU WERE ON THE RIGHT TRACK

525
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,742
WITH THAT WHOLE, YOU KNOW, SPONTANEOUS THING.

526
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,144
I MEAN, WOMEN REALLY LIKE THAT.

527
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,246
REALLY?

528
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,046
YEAH.

529
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,748
I MEAN, YOU KNOW...

530
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,750
I MEAN, IF IT WERE ME...

531
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,551
YEAH.

532
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,152
I'D WANT YOU TO...

533
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,354
WHAT?

534
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,756
I DON'T KNOW... CATCH ME OFF GUARD

535
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,158
YOU KNOW, WITH, LIKE, A REALLY GOOD KISS.

536
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,961
YOU KNOW, REALLY...

537
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:07,266
SORT OF, UM, SOFT... AT FIRST.

538
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,268
AND THEN MAYBE, UM...

539
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,670
BRUSH THE HAIR AWAY FROM MY FACE.

540
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,071
YEAH.

541
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,273
AND THEN LOOK

542
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,476
FAR INTO MY EYES...

543
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:21,480
IN A WAY THAT LET'S ME KNOW SOMETHING...

544
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,283
AMAZING IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

545
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,684
UH HUH.

546
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,290
AND THEN, I DON'T KNOW--

547
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,092
THEN YOU'D PULL ME REALLY CLOSE TO YOU

548
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:36,495
SO THAT, SO THAT I'D BE PRESSED UP

549
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,497
YOU KNOW, RIGHT AGAINST YOU.

550
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,700
AND, UM...

551
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,702
IT WOULD GET KIND OF...

552
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,706
SWEATY...

553
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:51,310
AND, UH, AND BLURRY...

554
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,915
AND THEN IT'S JUST HAPPENING.

555
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,117

556
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:03,822
THANKS, RACH.

557
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,023
GOOD NIGHT.

558
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:09,828
OH...

559
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,430
OH, GOD.

561
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:19,738

562
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:23,542
? JUST SINGING IN THE RAIN ?

563
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,544
? WHAT A GLORIOUS FEELING ?

564
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,145
? I'M HAPPY AGAIN ?

565
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,747
GOOD MORNING.

566
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:32,351
WELL, SOMEBODY GOT SOME LAST NIGHT.

567
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:38,357
TWICE.
