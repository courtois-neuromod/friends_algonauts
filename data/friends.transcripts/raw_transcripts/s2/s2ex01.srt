1
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:03,903
THIS IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT'S HAPPENED SO FAR.

2
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:06,906
ROSS WAS IN LOVE WITH RACHEL SINCE, YOU KNOW, FOREVER.

3
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:08,708
BUT, EVERY TIME HE TRIED TO TELL HER

4
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,310
SOMETHING KIND OF GOT IN THE WAY--

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,312
LIKE CATS, ITALIAN GUYS--

6
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:15,715
AND, FINALLY, CHANDLER WAS, LIKE, FORGET ABOUT HER.

7
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,617
BUT, WHEN ROSS WAS IN CHINA ON THIS DIG

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,520
CHANDLER LET IT SLIP THAT ROSS WAS IN LOVE WITH RACHEL.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,522
SHE WAS, LIKE, "OH, MY GOD."

10
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,725
SO SHE WENT TO THE AIRPORT TO MEET HIM WHEN HE CAME BACK.

11
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,327
BUT WHAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW

12
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,329
WAS ROSS WAS GETTING OFF THE PLANE WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

13
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,932
UH OH. SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW.

14
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,134
BUT ENOUGH ABOUT US.

15
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,735
SO HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

29
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:24,784
Flight number 457 from Beijing now arriving.

30
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,891
OH, MY GOD.

31
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,993
OH, MY GOD.

32
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,095
OH, MY... EXCUSE ME.

00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:36,396

35
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,999
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,701

37
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,907
RACH!

38
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,809

39
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,212
HEY. HI.

42
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,418

43
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:01,020

00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,122
OH, WHAT HAPPENED?

45
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,323

46
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,524

47
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:05,725

48
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:06,926
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

49
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,128

50
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:09,729

I'M TELLING YOU, SHE WENT TO THE AIRPORT

72
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,082
AND SHE'S GOING TO GO FOR IT WITH ROSS.

73
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:03,883
OH, MY GOD.

74
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,084
THIS IS HUGE.

75
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,986
THIS IS BIGGER THAN HUGE.

76
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:10,590
THIS IS, LIKE... ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S BIGGER THAN HUGE?

77
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,192

80
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:19,299
YES, YES, WE DID, THANKS TO VIDAL BUFFAY.

81
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,101
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T LOOK GOOD

82
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,303
WE DON'T LOOK GOOD.

83
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,305
I LOVE THAT VOICE.

84
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:31,110
AND THE WINNER IS AVA GARDNER.

85
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,013

88
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,019

OKAY, I THINK SHE'S TRYING TO TELL US SOMETHING.

92
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,830
QUICK, GET THE VERBS.

93
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,232

YOU SLOWPOKES!

97
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,140
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, RACH.

98
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,542
WE GOT THE BAGS.

99
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,544
HI. HELLO.

100
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,347
JULIE, THIS IS MY SISTER, MONICA.

101
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,548
THIS IS CHANDLER.

102
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:09,749
HEY. HEY.

103
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,950

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,552

105
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,355
OKAY, EVERYONE, THIS IS JULIE.

106
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,556
JULIE.

107
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,057
 OH...

108
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,661
HI! HI!

109
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:22,462
HI! HEY!

110
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,063
HI. I'M NOT HERE.

111
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,466
I'LL MAKE A MUCH BETTER FIRST IMPRESSION TOMORROW

112
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,269
WHEN I DON'T HAVE 20 HOURS OF CAB AND PLANE ON ME.

113
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,470
AND BUS.

114
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,271
OH, MY GOD. THAT...

115
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,472
THE SCREAMING GUY?

116
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,673
AND THE SPITTING?

117
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,275
 YOU GOT TO HEAR THIS STORY.

118
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:36,476
WE'RE ON THIS BUS

119
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,478
THAT'S EASILY 200 YEARS OLD, RIGHT?

120
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,679
AND THIS GUY...

121
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,681
AND THE CHICKEN POOPS IN HER LAP.

122
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,089
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

123
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,892
I JUST GAVE AWAY THE ENDING, DIDN'T I?

124
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:56,896
OH, IT'S JUST I JUST HEARD THIS STORY IN THE CAB

125
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,299
AND IT IS ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT.

126
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,303
THIS IS AMAZING.

127
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,504
I MEAN, HOW...?

128
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:05,705
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

129
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,807
ROSS AND I WERE IN GRAD SCHOOL TOGETHER.

130
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,109
BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER SINCE THEN.

131
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,311
WELL, I LAND IN CHINA.

132
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,313
GUESS WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THE DIG?

133
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,914
JULIE!

134
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:17,717
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

135
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,920
I MEAN, ISN'T THAT JUST KICK YOU IN THE CROTCH

136
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,922
SPIT ON YOUR NECK FANTASTIC?

137
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:25,925
IT'S AN EXPRESSION.

138
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,728
WE JUST WANTED TO SAY A QUICK HI.

139
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,730
THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO SEE THE BABY.

140
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,732
AND THEN WE'VE GOT TO GET SOME SLEEP.

141
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,134
YEAH. IT'S REALLY 6:00 TOMORROW NIGHT OUR TIME.

142
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:36,336
OKAY, WELL, LISTEN.

143
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,738
DON'T TELL US WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, THOUGH

144
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,740
BECAUSE I LIKE TO BE SURPRISED.

145
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,344
BYE.

146
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,945
BYE.

147
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,357
RACH, CAN I GET SOME COFFEE?

148
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,558
YEAH, SURE.

149
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,759
HEY, RACH.

150
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,760
DID YOU TALK TO HIM?

151
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,161
NO. THEN NO.

152
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,676
SO WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU IN CHINA?

153
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,277
I MEAN, WHEN LAST WE LEFT YOU

154
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,279
YOU WERE TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH... YOU KNOW.

155
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,881
I KNOW. I KNOW I WAS.

156
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,684
BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS THIS LITTLE VOICE INSIDE

157
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,887
THAT KEPT SAYING, "IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. MOVE ON."

158
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:29,889
YOU KNOW WHOSE VOICE THAT WAS?

159
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,692
GOD?

160
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,694
IT WAS YOU, PAL.

161
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,497
WELL, MAYBE IT WAS GOD DOING ME.

162
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,098
YOU KNOW?

163
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,501
BECAUSE ASIDE FROM BEING ALMIGHTY

164
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,102
HE'S A WHIZ AT VOICES.

165
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,704
LOOK, YOU WERE RIGHT, OKAY?

166
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,507
SHE LOOKS AT ME AND SEES A FRIEND, THAT'S ALL.

167
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,409
AND THEN I MET JULIE

168
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,010
AND WE'RE HAVING A GREAT TIME

169
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,211
AND I HAVE TO SAY

170
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,213
I NEVER WOULD HAVE GONE FOR IT WITH HER

171
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,815
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR YOU.

172
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,020
WELL, YOU OWE ME ONE, BIG GUY.

173
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,422
HERE'S YOUR LEMONADE.

174
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,623
I DIDN'T ORDER LEMONADE.

175
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,125
OH. WELL, THEN, YOU BETTER GO TAKE THAT BACK

176
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,528
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO CHARGE YOU FOR THAT.

177
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,829
BUT...

178
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,431
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO.

179
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,632
COME ON, COME ON.

180
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,435
OKAY, SO, UH, WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?

181
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,937
HE SAID...

182
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,539
HE SAID...

183
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,343
HE SAID THEY'RE HAVING A GREAT TIME.

184
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,945
I'M SORRY.

185
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,146
WHAT?

186
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,347
BUT

187
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,549
THE SILVER LINING

188
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,150
IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT

189
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,353
IS THAT HE MADE THIS DECISION ALL BY HIMSELF

190
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,156
WITHOUT ANY OUTSIDE HELP WHATSOEVER.

191
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,359
HOW IS THAT A SILVER LINING?

192
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,961
YOU HAVE TO REALLY WANT TO SEE IT.

193
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,966

194
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,968
IRONICALLY, THESE ARE THE GUYS

195
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,471
WHO WERE PICKED LAST IN GYM.

196
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,972
HEY, PHEEBS.

197
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,374
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING?

198
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,376
OH, OKAY.

199
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,982
HOW...

200
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,384
IT'S BEEN SO LONG SINCE YOU'VE HAD SEX

201
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,588
YOU'RE WONDERING IF THEY'VE CHANGED IT?

202
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,692
NOT EVEN CLOSE?

203
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:17,296
NO, ALTHOUGH NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING.

204
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,698
SO WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

205
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:19,899
WELL, I WAS THINKING

206
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,901
THAT YOU GAVE THE GUYS SUCH GREAT HAIRCUTS

207
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,303
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO DO MINE.

208
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,905
OH. NO.

209
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,407
WHY NOT?

210
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,909
BECAUSE I'M JUST...

211
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,511
I'M INCREDIBLY ANAL

212
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,913
AND AN UNBELIEVABLE CONTROL FREAK.

213
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,114
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

214
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,917
I KNOW I'M NOT, BUT YOU ARE

215
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,919
AND I'M TRYING TO SPARE YOUR FEELINGS.

216
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,120

217
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,321
 HELLO.

218
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,923

00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,836
WHO GAVE HER OUR PHONE NUMBER?

225
00:08:56,836 --> 00:09:00,640
OKAY, WELL, WHO HAD THE MOTIVE?

226
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,642

00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,243

228
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,845
THE CHEF...

229
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,046

230
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,249
OR WAS IT THE GUY WHO'S DATING HER?

231
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,853
GUY WHO'S DATING HER. GUY WHO'S DATING HER.

232
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,558
HEY, ANYBODY KNOW A GOOD TAILOR?

SOME CLOTHES ALTERED?

235
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,763
NO, NO, I'M JUST LOOKING FOR A MAN

236
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,765
TO DRAW ON ME WITH CHALK.

237
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,166
WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE FRANKIE?

238
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,168
MY FAMILY'S BEEN GOING TO HIM FOREVER.

239
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,170
HE DID MY FIRST SUIT WHEN I WAS 15.

240
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,472
NO, WAIT. 16.

241
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:37,877
NO. EXCUSE ME. 15.

OKAY, YOU HAVE TO STOP THE Q TIP

244
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,187

245
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,795
OKAY, OKAY, SWEETHEART

246
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,798

WELL, YOU DIDN'T HANG UP EITHER.

254
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,220
 SHE DIDN'T HANG UP EITHER.

255
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,926
OKAY, NO.

256
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,127
NO, YOU HANG UP.

00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,529
YOU. YOU. Y...

258
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:42,141
I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING TO ME.

259
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,944
RACHEL...

260
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,946
I'LL JUST CALL HER BACK.

261
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,547
OKAY.

262
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,855
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, HOW DID THIS HAPPEN TO ME?

263
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,257
A WEEK AGO, TWO WEEKS AGO, I WAS FINE.

264
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,859
ROSS WAS JUST ROSS.

265
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,460

266
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,664
NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE'S ROSS...

267
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,668
OH, THIS REALLY GREAT GUY THAT I CAN'T HAVE.

268
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,271
SWEETIE, I WANTED YOU TO HAVE HIM, TOO.

269
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,273
I KNOW YOU DID.

270
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,676
HEY, DO YOU WANT TO HIT CHANDLER AGAIN?

271
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,480
I'M JUST GOING TO DEAL WITH IT.

272
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,082

273
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,485
I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

274
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,191
OKAY, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU GUYS SAY.

275
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,694
SOMETHING IS BOTHERING HER.

276
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,499
YOU KNOW, I THINK I WAS 16.

277
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,906
YOU KNOW, I THINK I DON'T CARE.

278
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,109
PLEASE. JUST A LITTLE BIT OFF THE BACK?

279
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,510
I'M STILL ON "NO."

280
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,714
UH... MORNING.

281
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,115
HEY. HEY.

282
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,117
COULD YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES FOR A SEC?

283
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,118
OH, NO, NO.

284
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,120
I'M NOT FALLING FOR THAT AGAIN.

285
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:04,423
WHAT'S GOING ON?

286
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,826
WELL, I SORT OF DID A STUPID THING LAST NIGHT.

287
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,928
WHAT STUPID THING DID YOU DO?

288
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,930
BUONGIORNO, TUTTI!

289
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,731

00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,236
OKAY, PAOLO, NOW YOU'VE SEEN EVERYBODY.

291
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,638
AND, BETTER YET, THEY'VE ALL SEEN YOU.

292
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,144
RACHEL, HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

293
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,446
I JUST KIND OF RAN INTO HIM LAST NIGHT.

294
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:28,347
WHERE?

295
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:29,949
AT HIS APARTMENT.

296
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:30,750
IS THIS JUICE?

297
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,051
WHOA, WHOA.

298
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,652
AND THE FACT THAT YOU DUMPED HIM

299
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,254
BECAUSE HE HIT ON PHOEBE?

300
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,957
OH, GOD, I KNOW I'M PATHETIC.

301
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,158
I'M A LOSER.

302
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,559
HONEY, YOU'RE NOT PATHETIC.

303
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,761
YOU'RE JUST... YOU'RE SAD.

304
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,663
YEAH. PEOPLE DO STUPID THINGS WHEN THEY'RE UPSET.

305
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,465
MY GOD, IF I HAD A NICKEL FOR EVERY GUY

306
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:47,767
I WISH I HADN'T...

307
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,373
BUT THIS IS ABOUT YOUR HORRIBLE MISTAKE.

308
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:56,776
HI.

00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,977

YEAH, HE'S BACK.

00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,109
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

325
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,811
NO. NOT A PROBLEM.

326
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,613
GOOD. GLAD IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

327
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,516
OKAY, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO NOT TOUCH MY ASS.

328
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,321
WELL...

329
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:43,722

00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,324
AND PALPABLE TENSION

331
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,726
I'VE GOT PANTS THAT NEED TO BE ALTERED.

332
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,328
OH, HEY, CHANDLER, WHEN YOU SEE FRANKIE

333
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,330
TELL HIM JOEY TRIBBIANI SAYS HELLO.

334
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,932
HE'LL KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

335
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,436
YOU SURE HE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO CRACK THAT CODE?

336
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,340
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY, THE LAST TIME

337
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,943
PAOLO WAS HERE MY HAIR WAS SO MUCH SHORTER AND CUTER.

00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,847
OKAY, BUT,BUT

340
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:08,848

341
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,250
THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ALL CONTROL Y AND BOSSY

342
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,252

343
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,055
I PROMISE.

344
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,656
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE.

345
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,359
NOW, SOME OF YOU ARE GOING TO GET CUT

346
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,961

347
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,564

I QUIT.

351
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,580
WHAT? I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

352
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,582
YEAH, BUT THIS ISN'T THE FACE

353
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,385
OF A PERSON WHO TRUSTS A PERSON, OKAY?

354
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,787
THIS IS THE FACE OF A PERSON

355
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,590
WHO, YOU KNOW, DOESN'T TRUST A PERSON.

356
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,292
I'M SORRY. SORRY, PHOEBE.

357
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,495
IT'S JUST, WELL, IT'S JUST A LITTLE SHORTER

358
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,497

359
00:14:58,497 --> 00:14:59,999
WOULD YOU RELAX?

360
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,001
I KNOW WHAT I AM DOING.

361
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,704
THIS IS HOW HE WEARS IT.

362
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,107
HOW WHO WEARS IT?

363
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,708
DEMI MOORE.

364
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,711
DEMI MOORE IS NOT A HE.

365
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,514
WELL, HE WAS A HE IN ARTHUR AND INTEN.

366
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,018
THAT'S DUDLEY MOORE.

367
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:22,221
I SAID I WANTED IT LIKE DEMI MOORE.

368
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,822

WHICH ONE IS DEMI MOORE?

374
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,434
SHE'S THE ACTRESS THAT WAS IN DISCLOSURE

375
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,436

382
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,347
OH, MY GOD!

383
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:49,949
OH, MY GOD!

384
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,352

385
00:15:55,754 --> 00:16:00,059
WOW, THIS MUST BE WHAT MY BUTT MUST LOOK LIKE TO A FLY.

386
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,863
HOW LONG DO YOU WANT THE CUFFS?

387
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,866
AH, AT LEAST AS LONG AS I HAVE THE PANTS.

388
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,271
I JUST GOT THAT.

389
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:19,478
OKAY, NOW WE'LL DO YOUR INSEAM.

390
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,092
HOW IS SHE?

391
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:36,195
IT'S TOO SOON TO TELL.

392
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:40,599
SHE'S RESTING, WHICH IS A GOOD SIGN.

393
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,601
HOW'S THE HAIR?

394
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,204
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU, ROSS.

395
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,706
IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

396
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,510
AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO?

397
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,213
AT THIS POINT, IT'S A WAITING GAME.

398
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,814
I PUT A CLIP ON ONE SIDE

399
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:59,018
WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE STOPPED THE CURLING.

400
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,920
WELL, CAN WE SEE HER?

401
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,122
YOUR HAIR LOOKS TOO GOOD.

402
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,723
I THINK IT WOULD UPSET HER.

403
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,326
ROSS, WHY DON'T YOU COME ON IN?

404
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,427
YEAH.

405
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,235
WELL, HOW  ARE YOU DOING?

406
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:17,436
I'M OKAY.

407
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:18,737
OH, THAT BAD, HUH?

408
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,339
WHAT?

409
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,540
LOOK, RACH, I CAN SENSE

410
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,343
WHEN WOMEN ARE DEPRESSED AND VULNERABLE.

411
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,544
IT'S ONE OF MY GIFTS.

412
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,246
SIT.

413
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,648

414
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,051
OH, JOEY, WHEN I SAW HIM

415
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,853
GET OFF THAT PLANE WITH HER

416
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,457
I REALLY THOUGHT I HAD JUST HIT ROCK BOTTOM

417
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,660
BUT TODAY, IT'S LIKE THERE'S ROCK BOTTOM

418
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:46,065
50 FEET OF CRAP, THEN ME.

419
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,367
YOU GOT TO TELL ROSS HOW YOU FEEL.

420
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,469
HOW CAN I JUST TELL HIM?

421
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:51,670
WHAT ABOUT JULIE?

422
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:52,871
WHAT ABOUT HER?

423
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,274
THEY'VE ONLY BEEN GOING OUT FOR TWO WEEKS.

424
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,276
ROSS HAS BEEN IN LOVE WITH YOU

425
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,477
FOR, LIKE, TEN YEARS.

426
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,478
I DON'T KNOW.

427
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,080
LOOK, RACH, RACH

428
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,283
I'VE BEEN WITH MY SHARE OF WOMEN.

429
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,086
IN FACT, I'VE BEEN WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE'S

430
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,487
SHARE OF WOMEN.

431
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:12,591
BUT THE POINT IS, I'VE NEVER FELT ABOUT ANYONE

432
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,993
THE WAY ROSS FELT ABOUT YOU.

433
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,805
YO,PAISAN.

434
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:31,610
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SEC?

435
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:39,218
YOUR TAILOR IS A VERY BAD MAN.

436
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,620
FRANKIE? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

437
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,722
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

438
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,130
JOEY'S TAILOR...

439
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,635
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME.

440
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,637
WHAT?

441
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,838
NO WAY.

442
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,241
I'VE BEEN GOING TO THE GUY FOR 12 YEARS.

443
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,943
OH COME ON, HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO MY INSEAM.

444
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,945
THEN HE RAN HIS HAND UP MY LEG

445
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,547
AND THEN, THERE WAS DEFINITE...

446
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:09,748
WHAT?

447
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:10,949
CUPPING.

448
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,756
THAT'S HOW THEY DO PANTS.

449
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:19,758
FIRST THEY GO UP

450
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,360
ONE SIDE, THEY MOVE IT OVER

451
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,362
THEN THEY GO UP THE OTHER SIDE

452
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,165
THEY MOVE IT BACK, AND THEN THEY DO THE REAR.

453
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,467
WHAT? ROSS

454
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:29,668
WILL YOU TELL HIM?

455
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,070
ISN'T THAT HOW A TAILOR MEASURES PANTS?

456
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,273
YES, YES, IT IS-- IN PRISON!

457
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,582
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

458
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:44,783
WHAT?

459
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,188
THAT'S NOT...?

460
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,795
OH, MY GOD.

461
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,000
I'LL PUT ON A POT OF COFFEE.

462
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,411
EVEN MARY TYLER MOORE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.

463
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,413
COME ON

464
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,014
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

465
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,016
YOU NEVER KNOW...

466
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,618
BELL BOTTOMS CAME BACK IN.

467
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,322
WELL, I LIKE IT.

468
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,923
YEAH, I DO. I THINK IT'S A "10."

469
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,227

470
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,828
THANK YOU.

471
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,430
MY HAIR IS VERY AMUSED.

472
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,631
OH, COME ON, MONICA.

473
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:33,832
THINGS COULD BE WORSE.

474
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,834
I MEAN, UH... YOU COULD GET CAUGHT

475
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:36,635
BETWEEN THE MOON

476
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:37,936
AND NEW YORK CITY.

477
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,640
I KNOW IT'S CRAZY, BUT IT'S TRUE.

478
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,742

479
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,943
THANK YOU.

480
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,045
WELL, I GOT TO GO. BYE.

481
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:47,846
SEE YA.

482
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,448
BYE, RACH.

483
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,850
OH, WAIT. ARE, ARE YOU LEAVING?

484
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,752
YEAH, THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I MEANT BY "BYE."

485
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,555
WELL, UH, COULD I TALK TO YOU FOR A SEC?

486
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:57,856
OKAY.

487
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,862
HEY, WHEN THE DOCTOR DOES THAT HERNIA TEST..?

488
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,864
THAT'S OKAY.

489
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,670
IF YOUR MECHANIC DOES IT...

490
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,876
WHAT'S GOING ON?

491
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,778
UM...

492
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,581
WELL, UM, OKAY, FIRST OF ALL...

493
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,384
PAOLO AND I ARE NOT BACK TOGETHER.

494
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,587
THAT WAS JUST A STUPID THING THAT I DID

495
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,989
AND IF I COULD GO BACK IN TIME

496
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,792
AND DO IT AGAIN, WELL, I WOULDN'T.

497
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,194

498
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,196
UM... SECOND OF ALL...

499
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,198
WHAT?

500
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,800
OKAY. BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING

501
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,001
I JUST NEED TO KNOW

502
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,202
IS THIS ONE OF THOSE THINGS

503
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:45,804
WHERE YOU BREAK UP WITH A GUY

504
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,406
AND THEN I TELL YOU WHAT I THINK

505
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,607
AND THEN, THE NEXT DAY

506
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,609
YOU GET BACK TOGETHER WITH THE GUY

507
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,210
AND I LOOK LIKE

508
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,812
A COMPLETE IDIOT?

509
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,414
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

510
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,617
OKAY, UM, WELL, THEN, I THINK THE GUY'S SCUM.

511
00:21:58,617 --> 00:21:59,418
I HATE HIM.

512
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,619
I MEAN, I ACTU...

513
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,021
I I PHYSICALLY HATE HIM.

514
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,824
YOU KNOW? I ALWAYS HAVE, AND YOU, YOU ARE...

515
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,027
YOU'RE WAY TOO GOOD TO BE WITH A GUY LIKE THAT.

516
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:11,430
REALLY?

517
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,432
YOU DESERVE TO BE WITH SOMEONE

518
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,434
WHO APPRECIATES YOU, YOU KNOW

519
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,436
AND WHO GETS HOW... HOW FUNNY

520
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,238
AND SWEET AND AMAZING

521
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,840
AND ADORABLE AND...

522
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,442
SEXY YOU ARE, YOU KNOW?

523
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,844
SOMEONE WHO WAKES UP EVERY MORNING

524
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:30,248
THINKING, "OH, MY GOD. I'M, I I'M WITH RACHEL!"

525
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:34,052
YOU KNOW? SOMEONE WHO MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD.

526
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,455
LIKE THE WAY I DO WITH JULIE.

527
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,863
WAS THERE A... A "SECOND OF ALL"?

528
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,265
UH...

529
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:54,473
NO. UM, I THINK THAT WAS THE WHOLE ALL.

530
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,475
I GOT TO GO.

531
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,076
OKAY? OKAY.

532
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,978
THANKS.

533
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,179
OKAY.

534
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,884
BYE.

535
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,388
NO, I SWEAR TO GOD.

536
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,890
DAD, THAT'S NOT HOW THEY MEASURE PANTS.

537
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,699
I WAS THINKING OF DOING IT A LITTLE SHORTER--

538
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,701
YOU KNOW, LIKE ANDIE McDOWELL'S NEW HAIRCUT?

539
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,302
OH, YEAH. OH, I COULD DO THAT.

540
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,103
REALLY? YEAH.

541
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,304
DO YOU WANT TO DO IT RIGHT NOW?

542
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,105
GREAT.

543
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:28,407
OKAY. OKAY.

544
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,108
SEE YOU.

545
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:32,110
BYE.

546
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,513
OKAY, I WANT TO MAKE REALLY SURE THIS TIME.

547
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,114
ANDIE McDOWELL IS THE GIRL

548
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,517
FROM FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL,RIGHT?

549
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,720
NO.

550
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,623
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

551
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,526
THAT'S RODDY McDOWELL.

552
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:51,530
ANDIE McDOWELL IS THE GUY FROM PLANET OF THE APES.

553
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:53,331
OH, YEAH.

554
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:54,533
OKAY. THANK YOU.

555
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,234
YOU'RE WELCOME.
