1
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:07,407
HUH? SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

2
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:10,210
CASA DE JOEY.

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,212
I DECORATED IT MYSELF.

4
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:13,113
GET OUT. NO.

5
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,216
WOW, JOEY.

6
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:17,017

00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,218
ART.

8
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,620
ART IT IS.

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,622
WOW. CHECK THIS OUT.

10
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:23,823
IS IT A COFFEE TABLE?

11
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,425
IS IT A PANTHER?

12
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,027
THERE'S NO NEED TO DECIDE.

13
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,029
HEY.

14
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,031

SO, NOW, TELL ME.

16
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,234

17
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,835
 HEY, EXCELLENT

18
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:38,238

THANKS. YEAH, I LOVE THIS

20
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,441
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

21
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,843
MAKES ME WANT TO PEE.

22
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:44,844
YEAH, WELL, ME, TOO.

23
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,846
I THINK THAT'S THE CHALLENGE.

24
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:49,949
HEY, HOW COME, UH...

25
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,551
CHANDLER DIDN'T COME?

26
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,455
WELL, UH, IT'S BECAUSE HE HAD A THING WITH...

27
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,057
WITH WITH THE THING.

28
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,659
RIGHT.

29
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:00,860
I GOT I GOT IT.

30
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,564
SO WHY DON'T YOU SHOW US THE REST OF YOUR CASA?

31
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,765
 YEAH.

32
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,767
OH... OH, THE BEST PART!

33
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:08,968
COME ON!

34
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,973
EH?

35
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:17,177
HEY.

36
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,778
NICE TOILET.

37
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,581
NO, NO, NO. BEHIND IT.

38
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,583
OH, YOU HAVE A PHONE IN HERE?

39
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,384
THAT'S RIGHT.

40
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:27,987
I HAVE A PHONE... IN HERE.

41
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,589
JOEY, PROMISE ME SOMETHING.

42
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,790
YEAH.

43
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,392
NEVER CALL ME FROM THAT PHONE.

57
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,543
OH!

58
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,151
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

59
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,752
HONEY, I'M SORRY.

60
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:35,155
THEY WERE ALL OUT OF APPLE PIE.

61
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,557
SOMEONE JUST GOT THE LAST PIECE.

62
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,159
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

63
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,161
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS.

64
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,264
I HAVE JUST BEEN DISCOVERED.

65
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,265
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

66
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,267
I CLAIMED YOU IN THE NAME OF FRANCE

67
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,269
FOUR YEARS AGO.

68
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,571

69
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,374
ANYWAY, NOW PROMISE YOU WON'T FREAK OUT

70
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,776
AND SAY HOW GREAT THIS IS UNTIL I'M DONE, OKAY?

71
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:57,977
 OKAY.

72
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,078
OKAY.

73
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,680
I JUST MET THIS PRODUCER

74
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,682
OF THIS, LIKE, TEENY RECORD COMPANY

75
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,885
WHO SAID THAT I HAVE A VERY FRESH, OFFBEAT SOUND

76
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:09,489
AND SHE WANTS TO DO A DEMO OF "SMELLY CAT."

77
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,890

78
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,593
OKAY, I TOLD YOU NOT TO DO THAT YET.

79
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,994
OKAY...

80
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,797
AND SHE WANTS TO DO A VIDEO.

81
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,199

82
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,501
I'M NOT DONE YET, OKAY?

83
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,403
GOD.

84
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,405
OKAY, IF THAT GOES WELL

85
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,608
THEY MAY EVEN WANT TO MAKE AN ALBUM.

86
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,312
I'M DONE NOW.

87
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,413

88
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,217
OH, GOD, ROSS, IF YOU CARE ABOUT ME AT ALL

89
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,818
YOU'LL GET THE PIE OUT OF THE MAN'S HOOD.

90
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,420
GET THE WHAT?

91
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,822
THERE'S A PIE IN THE HOOD. PIE IN THE HOOD. GO.

92
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,530
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

93
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:51,731
I'M SORRY.

94
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,733
MY PIE WAS IN YOUR HOOD.

95
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,937
NOW I JUST HAVE TO GET THE COFFEE

96
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,539
OUT OF THAT GUY'S PANTS

97
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,541
AND I'LL BE BACK IN THE HOSPITAL BY 7:00.

98
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,449
DAMN IT, ROSS, GET YOUR BUTT

99
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,851
OUT OF THE BATHROOM!

100
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:12,652
CALM DOWN.

101
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,054
I'M BLOW DRYING.

102
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,256
BLOW DRYING WHAT?

103
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,258
YOU HAVE NO HAIR.

104
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:19,959
WHAT'S GOING ON?

105
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,961
YOUR BOYFRIEND HAS BEEN IN THERE

106
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,162
FOR OVER AN HOUR.

107
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,364
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

108
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,565
IT'S LIKE I'M LIVING WITH HIM AGAIN.

109
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,866
HE'S HERE WHEN I GO TO SLEEP

110
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:27,667
HE'S HERE WHEN I WAKE UP

111
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,669
HE'S HERE WHEN I WANT TO USE THE SHOWER.

112
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,271
UGH! I FEEL LIKE I'M 16 ALL OVER AGAIN.

113
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,872
WELL, YOU'RE NOT 16.

114
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,474
YOU'RE BOTH ADULTS NOW.

115
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,776
GET OUT, YOU DOOFUS!

116
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,779
OR, YOU KNOW

117
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,582
HE'S RUBBER AND YOU'RE GLUE.

118
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,587
ALL YOURS.

119
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,689
I HOPE YOU CLEANED YOUR HAIR OUT OF THE DRAIN.

120
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,892
I HOPE YOU CLEANED YOUR HAIR OUT OF THE DRAIN.

121
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,193
SHUT UP.

122
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:55,495
SHUT UP.

123
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,096
CUT IT OUT!

124
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,799

125
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,805
I'VE NEVER WANTED YOU MORE.

126
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,611
MI MI MI MI MI MI MI.

127
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,938
Hello.

128
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,141
LOUIE? WHERE'S HOWARD?

129
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,743
He went home.

130
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,546
OH. HE SAID HE MIGHT STOP UP AFTER HIS SHIFT.

131
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,349
He said to tell you he wasn't feeling so good.

132
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:54,153
OH. HEY, WHAT TIME DO YOU GET OFF?

133
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,155
I'm not feeling too good either.

134
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,365
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY, BOYS?

135
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,167
SHOULD I CALL HIM?

136
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:12,171

137
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,974
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY:

138
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,177
ASK YOUR SLIPPERS A QUESTION...

139
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:21,381
YOU'RE GOING CRAZY.

140
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,986

141
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,187
OW!

142
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,191
FREAKING ART!

143
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,694
HELLO.

144
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:35,895
 Hey.

145
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,497
HEY!

146
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,999
LISTEN, I'M SORRY I DIDN'T MAKE IT OVER THERE TODAY.

147
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,501
OH, THAT'S OKAY.

148
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,303
YOU, UH... YOU HAD A THING.

149
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,706
YEAH, WELL, I HEAR THE PLACE LOOKS GREAT.

150
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,508
OH, FORGET ABOUT IT.

151
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,109
I'M HAVING A BALL.

152
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,512
HOW'S THE APARTMENT DOING?

153
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,813
OH, HEY, IT'S TERRIFIC.

154
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,815
I MEAN, IT'S A REGULAR SPACE...

155
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,118
FEST.

156
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,820
OH.

157
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,822
WELL, GREAT.

158
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:03,623
Yeah, I just...

159
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,526
YOU KNOW, WANTED TO CALL AND SAY "HEY."

160
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:09,328
WELL, OKAY THEN.

161
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,329

162
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,331
WAS THAT THE OVEN TIMER?

163
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:14,333
THAT'S RIGHT, MY FRIEND.

164
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,335
It's time for...

165
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,537
 BAYWATCH!

166
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,139

167
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,541
Oh...

168
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,143
CAN YOU BELIEVE THEY GAVE STEPHANIE SKIN CANCER?

169
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,746
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE THEY PROMOTED HER TO LIEUTENANT.

170
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,648
OH, YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT

171
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,050
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH YASMINE BLEETH.

172
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,253
WELL, HOW COULD ANYONE NOT BE IN LOVE WITH YASMINE BLEETH?

173
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,855
 HEY!

174
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,857
HEY! THEY'RE RUNNING!

175
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,961
SEE, THIS IS THE BRILLIANCE OF THE SHOW.

176
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,963
I SAY ALWAYS KEEP THEM RUNNING.

177
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,366
ALL THE TIME, RUNNING.

178
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,368
Run!

179
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,370
Run!

180
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,574
RUN, YASMINE! RUN LIKE THE WIND!

181
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:56,976
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED

182
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,578
TO LIVE BY YOURSELF.

183
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,378
I DID.

184
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,980
I THOUGHT IT'D BE GREAT.

185
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,683
I FIGURED I'D HAVE, LIKE, TIME ALONE WITH MY THOUGHTS

186
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,685
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT TURNS OUT

187
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,488
I DON'T HAVE AS MANY THOUGHTS AS YOU'D THINK.

188
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,692
JOEY, WHY DON'T YOU TALK TO CHANDLER ABOUT MOVING BACK?

189
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,694
YOU REALLY THINK HE'D TAKE ME?

190
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,096
I MEAN, WE HAD A PRETTY GOOD TALK LAST NIGHT

191
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,098
BUT, WHEN I MOVED OUT, I HURT HIM BAD.

192
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,299
I PROMISE YOU

193
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,301
HE WOULD DEFINITELY WANT YOU BACK.

194
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,704
I'M TELLING YOU, THERE'S NO WAY HE'S MOVING BACK.

195
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,907
BUT WE HAD ONE OF THE GREATEST TALKS

196
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,909
WE EVER HAD LAST NIGHT.

197
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,110
I MEAN, IT WAS...

198
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,313
IT WAS LIKE WHEN WE FIRST STARTED LIVING TOGETHER.

199
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,817
LOOK, I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS RIGHT NOW, BUT...

200
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,219
WE'VE SEEN HIM IN HIS NEW PLACE, ALL RIGHT

201
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,020
AND HE'S HAPPY.

202
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,823
HE'S... HE'S DECORATED.

203
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,427
LOOK, CHANDLER, HE HAS MOVED ON, OKAY?

204
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,629
YOU HAVE TO, TOO.

205
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:50,830
BUT...

206
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,533
NO. YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACT

207
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,134
THAT YOU'RE JUST FRIENDS NOW, OKAY?

208
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,537
YOU'RE NOT... ROOMMATES ANYMORE.

209
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,439
Okay, Phoebe.

210
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,240
Ready to try one?

211
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,842
OKAY.

212
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,844

213
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,445
? SMELLY CAT ?

214
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,447
? SMELLY CAT ?

215
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,250
? WHAT ARE THEY FEEDING YOU? ?

216
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,653
? SMELLY, SMELLY, SMELLY? ? SMELLY CAT, SMELLY CAT... ?

217
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,254
? REALLY BAD SMELLING SMELLY CAT...?

218
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,455
WHOA! OH, MY GOD!

219
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,460
I MEAN, LIKE, WHO WAS THAT?

220
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,963
They're your backup singers.

221
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,965
Behind you, hon.

222
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,967
OH!

223
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,770
OH, I THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST WATCHING ME.

224
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,872
YOU KNOW, LIKE...

225
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,073
LIKE AT AN AQUARIUM.

226
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,675
WOW, THEY'RE SO GOOD.

227
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:36,876
HI. YOU'RE SO GOOD.

228
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,377
All righty.

229
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:41,080
Okay. Now that everyone knows everyone

230
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,281
let's try it again.

231
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,482
OKAY.

232
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,383
From the top.

233
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,385
? SMELLY CAT ?

234
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:47,987
? SMELLY CAT ?

235
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:51,090
? WHAT ARE THEY FEEDING YOU? ?

236
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,692
? SMELLY, SMELLY, SMELLY? ? SMELLY CAT ?

237
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,694
? REALLY BAD SMELLING SMELLY CAT?

238
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,295
? IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT...?

239
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,496
OKAY. SORRY.

240
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,198
I'M JUST NOT GETTING

241
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,200
THAT EVERYONE, UM...

242
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,204
GETS HOW SMELLY THIS CAT ACTUALLY IS.

243
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,406
I JUST THINK IF WE COULD TALK ABOUT THIS

244
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,708
BECAUSE I NEED TO FEEL

245
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,110
THAT YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT THE CAT.

246
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,312
Honey, we can talk about this.

247
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:14,814
It's just that it's costing

248
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,617
about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here.

249
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,618
OH, OKAY.

250
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,219
SO THE CAT STINKS, BUT YOU LOVE IT.

251
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,321
LET'S GO.

252
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,725
NO. THERE IS NO WAY HE WAS A VELOCIRAPTOR.

253
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,926
NO, TONY.

254
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,527
LOOK AT THE CRANIAL RIDGE, OKAY?

255
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:29,729
IF DINO WAS A VELOCIRAPTOR

256
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,731
HE WOULD HAVE EATEN THE FLINTSTONES.

257
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,332
YEAH... YEAH.

258
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,635
OH, WERE YOU TAKING A NAP?

259
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,236
I WAS.

260
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,237
OH, WAIT.

261
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,640
TONY, CAN YOU HOLD ON? THAT'S THE OTHER LINE.

262
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,841
HELLO.

263
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:45,444
OH, YES, SHE'S HERE, BUT CAN SHE CALL YOU BACK?

264
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,046
OKAY, THANKS.

265
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,247
CALL JOANNA. HI.

266
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,849
DID SHE LEAVE A NUMBER?

267
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,150
DID YOU SEE ME

268
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,052
WRITE ONE DOWN?

269
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,855
I DON'T HAVE HER NUMBER, BUTTMUNCH.

270
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,457
WELL, SHE'LL CALL BACK.

271
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,059
DON'T BE SUCH A BABY.

272
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,560
I'M NOT A BABY. YOU'RE THE BABY.

273
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,762
YOU WANT TO GET OFF MY BACK?

274
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:03,963
YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF MY FACE?

275
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,166
WAIT. HOLD ON, TONY. HOLD ON.

276
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,467
HELLO.

277
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,069
HI.

278
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,071
YEAH. NO. SHE'S RIGHT HERE.

279
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,272
UM, HOLD ON.

280
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,675
HI. TONY, CAN I CALL YOU BACK?

281
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,477
THAT'S, UH... THAT'S MY SISTER'S BOYFRIEND.

282
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,979
GIVE ME THAT.

283
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,580
OKAY.

284
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,382
HI, SWEETIE.

285
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,984
LISTEN, BEFORE I FORGET--

286
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,787
DID I LEAVE MY DIAPHRAGM AT YOUR PLACE?

287
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,089
HI, MOM.

288
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,108
HEY!

289
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,612
SO, UH...

290
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,214
HOW'S THE PALACE?

291
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,616
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY YOU SHOULD MENTION THAT

292
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,618
BECAUSE I WAS THINKING...

293
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:00,820
WHAT'S WITH THE BOXES?

294
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,423
OH, UH... ACTUALLY

295
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,425
I, UH, HAVE SOME NEWS.

296
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,928
HEY, CHAN, IS JOEY GOING TO PICK UP HIS MOOSE HAT

297
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,229
OR SHOULD I JUST TOSS IT OUT?

298
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,932
WELL, UH, WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM YOURSELF.

299
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,334
JOEY, THIS IS MY NEW ROOMMATE, EDDIE.

300
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,635
NICE TO MEET YOU.

301
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:17,436
LIKEWISE.

302
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,637
HOW YOU DOING?

303
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:19,839
I'LL TAKE THAT.

304
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,040
OH.

305
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,843
IT'S, UH... WHAT I CAME FOR.

306
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,245
SO, THIS IS NEW.

307
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,847
WHERE'D YOU TWO MEET?

308
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:31,050
AT THE SUPERMARKET, IN THE ETHNIC FOOD SECTION.

309
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,052
I HELPED HIM PICK OUT A CHORIZO.

310
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,653

311
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:35,855
WOW.

312
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,156
YOU KNOW, WE GOT TO TALKING

313
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,959
AND HE SAID HE NEEDED A PLACE, AND I HAD A SPARE ROOM.

314
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,160
OH.

315
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,762
NOW IT'S A SPARE ROOM?

316
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,164
WELL, YEAH, IN THAT IT'S NOT BEING USED

317
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,166
AND I HAVE IT TO SPARE.

318
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,367
RIGHT.

319
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:53,172
WELL, I, UH, GOT WHAT I CAME FOR.

320
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,576
I'LL, UH, I'LL SEE YOU GUYS.

321
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,578
HEY, JOE?

322
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,682
WHEN DID YOU START USING MOOSE IN YOUR HAIR?

323
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,684

324
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,386
IS THIS GUY GREAT OR WHAT?

325
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,388
YEAH.

326
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:10,589
YEAH, HE IS.

327
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,398
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE HAS A NEW ROOMMATE.

328
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,599
WHO IS THIS GUY?

329
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,002
EDDIE SOMETHING. HE JUST MET HIM.

330
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,203
IT'LL NEVER LAST.

331
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,205
HE'S JUST A REBOUND ROOMMATE.

332
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,807
HEY!

333
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,809
OOH, CHECK IT OUT.

334
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,811
CHECK IT OUT.

335
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,913
IT'S "SMELLY CAT"-- THE VIDEO.

336
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,314
HEY!

337
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,817
NOW, OKAY, I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET

338
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,020
SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, WELL, SO WHAT?

339
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,422
NONE OF YOU EVER MADE A VIDEO.

340
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,227
OKAY.

341
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,533
Get out of here, cat!

342
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,534
You stink!

343
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,242
 WHOA.

344
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,443

I SOUND AMAZING.

361
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,177

362
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,080

I'VE NEVER HEARD MYSELF SING BEFORE.

369
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,495
I MEAN, EXCEPT IN MY OWN HEAD.

370
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,696
THIS IS SO COOL.

371
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,698
NOW I CAN HEAR WHAT YOU HEAR.

372
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,802
PRETTY DIFFERENT, HUH?

373
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:07,806
I AM SORRY, BUT I AM INCREDIBLY TALENTED.

00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,235
WHERE'S THE MAIL?

383
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,137
OH, IT'S OVER THERE ON THE TABLE.

384
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,940
YOU DON'T KEEP IT OVER HERE ON THIS TABLE ANYMORE?

385
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,942
NAH. EDDIE LIKES TO KEEP IT OVER THERE.

386
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,147
ALL RIGHT, HERE YOU GO, MY FRIEND.

387
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,749
EGGS A LA EDDIE.

388
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,552
OOH, OOH.

389
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,654
OH... OH...

390
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,656
THAT'S GREAT.

391
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:58,857
HUH.

392
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,059
WHAT?

393
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,861
NO, I JUST THOUGHT YOU LIKED YOUR EGGS

394
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:05,664
WITH THE BREAD WITH THE HOLE IN THE MIDDLE--

395
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:06,865
A LA ME.

396
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,667
I DO, BUT EDDIE MAKES THEM THIS WAY.

397
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,669
WELL, THEY'RE PRETTY DARN GOOD.

398
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,171
YOU LIKE SOME, MAN? THERE'S EXTRA.

399
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:13,872
NO, THANKS.

400
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,474
ALL RIGHT. WELL, YOU GUYS

401
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,576
I'M OUT OF HERE.

402
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,578
SEE YOU, PALS.

403
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:20,479
SEE YA.

404
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,284
SO, HOW YOU TWO GETTING ALONG?

405
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,286
OH, I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.

406
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,387
GREAT.

407
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,789
WELL, I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

408
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,594
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

409
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:38,697
HE JUST COMES IN HERE

410
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,499
MR. JOHNNY NEW EGGS

411
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,101
WITH HIS, HIS...

412
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:46,605
HIS MOVING THE MAIL AND HIS, HIS "SEE YA, PALS."

413
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,608
AND NOW THERE'S NO JUICE.

414
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,310
THERE'S NO JUICE FOR THE PEOPLE

415
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,712
WHO NEED THE JUICE AND WANT THE JUICE.

416
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:54,913
I NEED THE JUICE!

417
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:58,217
THERE'S ANOTHER CARTON RIGHT OVER THERE.

418
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,921
THIS ISN'T ABOUT JUICE ANYMORE, ALL RIGHT, MAN?

419
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,123
ALL RIGHT.

420
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,724
SO WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

421
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:06,725
EGGS.

422
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:07,826
WHOSE EGGS DO YOU LIKE BETTER?

423
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,328
HIS OR MINE?

424
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:12,131
WELL, I LIKE BOTH EGGS EQUALLY.

425
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,732
OH, COME ON.

426
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,934
NOBODY LIKES TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF EGGS EQUALLY.

427
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,136
YOU LIKE ONE BETTER THAN THE OTHER

428
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,337
AND I WANT TO KNOW WHICH.

429
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,938
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

430
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,540
YOUR EGGS

431
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,841
AREN'T HERE ANYMORE, ARE THEY?

432
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,244
YOU TOOK YOUR EGGS AND YOU LEFT!

433
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:28,447
DID YOU REALLY EXPECT ME TO NEVER FIND NEW EGGS?

434
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:32,351
WELL, MAYBE THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE EGGS.

435
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:36,755
MAYBE THIS IS ABOUT THE CHICKEN THAT LAID THEM.

436
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,357
HUH?

437
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,558
WHAT CHICKEN?

438
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,759
THERE'S NO CHICKEN.

439
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,761
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU!

440
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,668
I WANT TO WATCH ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT.

441
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,471
TOUGH NOOGIES. WE'RE WATCHING PREDATORS OF THE SERENGETI.

442
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:54,873
WOULD YOU GUYS STOP?

443
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,975
IT'S MY TV.

444
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:57,776
QUIT IT.

445
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:58,977
BITE ME.

446
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,179
OH, MY GOD.

447
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,581
MONICA KEEPS CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

448
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,784
THAT'S GREAT. WHY DON'T YOU TELL MOMMY ON ME?

449
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,987
NOW I'M MOMMY IN THIS LITTLE PLAY?

450
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,189
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

451
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,991
I REFUSE TO GET SUCKED INTO THIS, LIKE, WEIRD

452
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,593
LITTLE GELLER DIMENSION THING.

453
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,195
SO I'M GOING TO GO

454
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,597
AND TAKE A NICE, LONG HOT BUBBLE BATH

455
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,400
BECAUSE YOU KIDS ARE DRIVING ME CRAZY!

456
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,504
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS?

457
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,506
I GUESS WE COULD TAPE ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT.

458
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,707
NOT THAT.

459
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,309
THIS. US.

460
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,512

463
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,818
MON, MON, MON, YOU'VE GONE ULTRASONIC AGAIN.

464
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:44,623
I JUST CAN'T STAND YOU BEING HERE ALL THE TIME.

465
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,226
WHY? WHY? WHY CAN'T YOU STAND ME BEING HERE?

466
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,228
YOU KNOW, WE'RE JUST HAVING FUN.

467
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,131
FUN? YOU THINK THIS IS FUN?

468
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,332
YEAH.

469
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,734
I MEAN, I THOUGHT WE WERE JUST FOOLING AROUND

470
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:56,935
LIKE WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

471
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:59,338
ROSS, I HATED YOU WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

472
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,041
YOU HATED ME WHEN WE WERE KIDS?

473
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,643
YES. I HATED YOU.

00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,446
I LOVED YOU IN A YOU'RE  MY BROTHER SO I HAVE TO KIND OF WAY

BUT, BASICALLY, YEAH, I HATED YOUR GUTS.

476
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,151
WHY DID YOU HATE ME?

477
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,754
BECAUSE YOU WERE MEAN TO ME, AND YOU... YOU TEASED ME

478
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,957
AND YOU ALWAYS, ALWAYS GOT YOUR WAY.

479
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:22,461
AND THAT WASN'T FUN FOR YOU?

480
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,364

481
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,467
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HATED ME.

482
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,970
NOW I LOVE YOU.

483
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,375
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE I HAVE TO.

484
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,177
REALLY?

485
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,179
YEAH.

486
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,382
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO STOP PISSING ME OFF.

487
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,188
I CAN DO THAT.

488
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,890
THEN I WON'T HAVE TO KILL YOU.

489
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:58,197
SO YOU WANT TO WATCH ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT?

490
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,999
AW, THANKS.

491
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,301
America's premier sports magazine...

492
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,303
YOU KNOW WHAT?

493
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,504

494
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:08,307

496
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,109
OH... OKAY.

497
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,419
HEY, LISTEN, YOU ARE NOT GOING

498
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,421
TO BELIEVE THIS

499
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:26,024
BUT THAT IS NOT ME SINGING ON THE VIDEO.

500
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,427
NO! NO! NO!

501
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,028
YES.

502
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,630
WELL, HOW DID YOU FIND OUT?

503
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,232
OKAY, THE RECORD COMPANY SENT OVER

504
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,833
THIS PIECE OF PAPER FOR ME TO SIGN

505
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,036
SAYING THAT IT'S OKAY FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO SING FOR ME.

506
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,238
THAT WAS MY FIRST CLUE.

507
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,241
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

508
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,043
WELL, I CAN'T WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO WOULD DO THIS.

509
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,645
SURE.

510
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,046
I MEAN, THIS POOR WOMAN.

511
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,449
WHAT WOMAN?

512
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,650
THE VOICE WOMAN.

513
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,853
SHE HAS A GREAT VOICE, BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE A VIDEO.

514
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:58,056
OKAY, PHEEBS, BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU?

515
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,158
WELL, I HAVE A VIDEO.

516
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,561
YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION.

517
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,364
NO, THIS VOICE WOMAN, SHE'S SO TALENTED.

518
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,766
BUT, ACCORDING TO THE PRODUCER PEOPLE

519
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,569
SHE DOESN'T HAVE, LIKE, THE RIGHT LOOK OR SOMETHING.

520
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:14,172
IT'S LIKE SHE'S, LIKE, ONE OF THOSE ANIMALS AT THE POUND

521
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,374
WHO, LIKE, NOBODY WANTS

522
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,376
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PRETTY ENOUGH

523
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,378
FOR IT, YOU KNOW.

524
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,780
LIKE SOME OLD DOG WHO'S JUST KIND OF, LIKE, STINKY AND...

525
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,182
OH, MY GOD. SHE'S SMELLY CAT.

526
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,788
OH, THAT SONG HAS SO MANY LEVELS.

527
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,193
HEY, EDDIE, YOU WANT TO PLAY SOME FOOSBALL?

528
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:36,795
NO, THANKS, MAN.

529
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,397
I'M NOT REALLY INTO SPORTS.

530
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,704
YEAH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

531
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,306

532
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,607
DOESN'T MATTER.

533
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,208
TIME FOR BAYWATCH.

534
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,810
WHAT?

535
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,812
YOU YOU LIKE THAT SHOW?

536
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,816
YOU DON'T LIKE THAT SHOW?

537
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,117
NO, MAN.

538
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,119
IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF PRETTY PEOPLE

539
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,721
RUNNING AROUND ON THE BEACH.

540
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,424
WELL, THAT'S THE BRILLIANCE OF IT.

541
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,428
THE PRETTY PEOPLE...

542
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,031
AND THE RUNNING.

543
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,834
I'M GOING TO GO READ

544
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,236
IN MY ROOM FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

545
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,738
OH, OKAY, MAN.

546
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,544

547
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:30,749
? ALL ALONE ?

548
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:34,353

549
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:40,359

550
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:46,164
? NO ONE IS HOME ?

551
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:58,977
? ALL BY MYSELF ?

552
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:06,585
? DON'T WANT TO LIVE ALL BY MYSELF ?

553
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,388
? ANYMORE ?

554
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:14,793

555
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,398
I'M GOING TO START OFF
