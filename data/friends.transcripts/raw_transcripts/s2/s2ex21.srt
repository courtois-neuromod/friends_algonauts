1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,203
Stocks and bonds are moving higher. Good day.

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:05,505
HEY, MONICA, WHY ARE WE WATCHING THE BUSINESS CHANNEL?

3
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,507
BECAUSE I WAS GOING BY IT THE OTHER DAY

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,610
AND I SAW THAT THERE WAS A STOCK WITH MY INITIALS, M.E.G., ON IT

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,013
AND SOMETIMES I HAVE TO WATCH FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,214
BEFORE IT COMES UP AGAIN

7
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,815
BUT, WHEN IT DOES, IT'S PRETTY EXCITING.

8
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:19,119
HMM... OKAY, HONEY, YOU REALLY NEED A JOB.

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,121
MON, SPEAK ING OF WHICH

10
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,322
DAD SAYS HE KNOWS SOMEONE

11
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:23,923
REALLY? YOU CAN CALL FOR AN INTERVIEW.

12
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:25,525
OKAY, RIGHT THERE.

13
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,927
THAT'S THE THIRD SIGN TODAY, RIGHT THERE.

14
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:32,632
ON BEHALF OF EVERYONE, I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY, "MHEH?"

15
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:33,933
NO, BECAUSE YOU JUST SAID "DAD"

16
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,736
AND EVERYWHERE I GO TODAY, I KEEP GETTING SIGNS

17
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:39,139
TELLING ME TO GO SEE MY FATHER.

18
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,640
LIKE WHEN I WAS WALKING OVER HERE

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,642
AND I PASSED A BUFFET.

20
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,945
WHICH IS MY FATHER'S LAST NAME.

21
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,348
AH! OH! AH!

22
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,949
AND THEY WERE SERVING FRANKS

23
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,153
HIS FIRST NAME, MINUS THE "S" AT THE END.

24
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,155
AH! YES.

25
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:58,158
AND THERE WAS A ROTISSERIE WITH ASPINNING CHICKEN.

26
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,361
HIS INDIAN NAME?

27
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,763
NO, BECAUSE I CHICKENED OUT

28
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,365
THE LAST TIME...

29
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:06,966
WHEN I TRIED TO MEET HIM.

30
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,568
SO, I MEAN, COINCIDENCES?

31
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,170
I DON'T THINK SO.

32
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,971
FREAKY. WEIRD. EERIE.

33
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,374
OKAY, SO WHO WANTS THE, UH, LAST HAMBURGER?

34
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,776
OH, ALL RIGHT, NOW I HAVE TO GO SEE HIM.

35
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:17,977
WHY?

36
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,579
HAMBURGER.

37
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,181
McDONALD'S.

38
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,782
OLD McDONALD HAD A FARM.

39
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,384
MY DAD WAS A PHARMACIST.

40
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:26,886
OHH!

41
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:32,492
AND E I E I O IS WHAT YOUR MOM SAID WHEN YOUR DAD LEFT HER.

42
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:33,293
YES!

43
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,494
REALLY?

44
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:35,195
NO.

58
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,044
MAN, I AM SO BEAT.

59
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,046
OH, YEAH.

60
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,449
HEY, YOU WANT TO JUST FORGET ABOUT RACQUETBALL

61
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:30,650
AND HANG OUT HERE?

62
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,252
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

63
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,455
HEY, YOU'RE IN OUR SEATS.

64
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,056
OH, SORRY, WE DIDN'T KNOW.

65
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,058
HEY, WE WERE SITTING THERE.

66
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:42,262
OKAY, THERE IS ONE MORE WAY TO SAY IT.

67
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,264
WHO KNOWS IT?

68
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,066
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY?

69
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:50,270
NO, ACTUALLY, I WAS JUST GOING FOR COLORFUL.

70
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,471
WHAT'S WITH THIS GUY?

71
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,272
WHAT'S WITH YOU?

72
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,573
UH... NOTHING.

73
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:54,974
NOTHING'S WITH HIM.

74
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,976
ENJOY YOUR COFFEE.

75
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,485
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

76
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:08,888
I JUST TOOK YOUR HAT.

77
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:10,890
SEE, I CAN BE FUNNY, TOO.

78
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,693
MY MY JOKE IS THAT I I TOOK YOUR HAT.

79
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,496
THAT... THAT... THAT IS FUNNY.

80
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,097
CAN I HAVE IT BACK?

81
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,299
NO.

82
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,101
NO?

83
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:22,502
NO.

84
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,703
OKAY.

85
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:25,305
OKAY.

86
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,906
YOU KNOW WHAT?

87
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,309
I THINK YOU'VE VERY FUNNY.

88
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,311
KUDOS ON THAT HAT JOKE.

89
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,914
BUT COME ON, GUYS

90
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,317
JUST JUST GIVE HIM BACK THE HAT.

91
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,918
WHY SHOULD WE?

92
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:42,121
BECAUSE IT'S A SPECIAL HAT.

93
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,723
SEE, HE BOUGHT  IT

94
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,125
BECAUSE HE WAS FEELING REALLY DOWN ONE DAY.

95
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,729
SO HE GOT THE HAT TO CHEER HIMSELF UP, YOU KNOW?

96
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,930
NOW, CHANDLER, YOU WOULDN'T...

97
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,532
STOP TALKING.

98
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,133
STOP TALKING NOW.

99
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,335
 LET ME JUST GET THIS STRAIGHT.

100
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,837
YOU'RE ACTUALLY STEALING MY HAT?

101
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,439
YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

102
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,042
NO. JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.

103
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,445
I'M TELLING YOU, RACH

104
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,248
I'VE GONE DAD HUNTING WITH PHOEBE BEFORE.

105
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,050
THIS IS A VERY SCARY THING FOR HER.

106
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,453
SHE GETS REAL VULNERABLE AND ...

107
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,054
THAT'S WHY WE'RE THERE

108
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,857
TO, YOU KNOW, BE SUPPORTIVE AND CRAP.

109
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:21,461
OKAY. WELL, YOU JUST LET ME KNOW WHEN TO DO WHICH.

110
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,264
HEY, HOW'D

111
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,765
THE INTERVIEW GO?

112
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,166
IT BIT.

113
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,668
IT WAS A 50S

114
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,270
THEME RESTAURANT.

115
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,272
I'D HAVE TO COOK IN A COSTUME

116
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,274
AND DANCE ON THE COUNTER.

117
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,076
I MEAN, I WAS A SOUS CHEF AT CAFE DES ARTISTES.

118
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,778
I MEAN, HOW COULD I TAKE A JOB

119
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,581
WHERE I HAVE TO MAKE SOMETHING CALLED "LAVERNE & CURLY FRIES"?

120
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,582
SO DON'T DO IT.

121
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,783
HOW CAN I NOT DO IT?

122
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,785
I HAVE $127 DOLLARS IN THE BANK!

123
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,787
MONICA, RELAX.

124
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,988
GO GET A BEER.

125
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,590
I DON'T WANT A BEER!

126
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,191
WHO SAID IT WAS FOR YOU?

127
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,300
HI. HI.

128
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,201
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

129
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,805
THESE MEAN GUYS AT THE COFFEE HOUSE TOOK MY HAT.

130
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,407
NO! YOU'RE KIDDING.

131
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,008
 IT WAS RIDICULOUS.

132
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,209
YOU KNOW, THESE GUYS, THEY WERE BULLIES.

133
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,811
ACTUAL BULLIES, YOU KNOW?

134
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,012
WE'RE GROWN UPS.

135
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,815
THIS KIND OF STUFF ISN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN ANYMORE.

136
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,016
OHH!

137
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:17,817
HI. HI.

138
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,319
OHH!

139
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,920
OH, NO, WAIT A MINUTE

140
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,121
I HAVE NO ONE.

141
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,428
HEY, WELL, LET'S GO DOWN THERE AND GET YOUR HAT BACK.

142
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,129
AW, FORGET IT.

143
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,733
IT'S PROBABLY STRIPPED AND SOLD FOR PARTS BY NOW.

144
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,934
HEY!

145
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,235
I WENT UP.

146
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,837
WHAT? MY STOCK.

147
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,839
M.E.G. IT WENT UP TWO POINTS.

148
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,443
DO YOU REALIZE THAT IF I HAD INVESTED MY $127

149
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,644
IN MYSELF YESTERDAY

150
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:47,046
THAT I'D, LIKE, HAVE...

151
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,048
A LOT MORE THAN THAT TODAY?

152
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,850
YOU KNOW WHAT?

153
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,851
I'M GOING TO DO IT.

154
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,553
DO WHAT?

155
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:54,854
PUT ALL MY MONEY IN ME.

156
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,456
MONICA, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

157
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,057
YOU DON'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET.

158
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,659
WHAT'S TO KNOW?

159
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,661
BUY! SELL! HIGH! LOW! BEARS! BULLS!

160
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,262
YES, MANHATTAN.

161
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,665
YEAH, TELEPHONE NUMBER OF THE STOCK...

162
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,266

STORE.

164
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,877

165
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,479
WELL... SEE? DIDN'T I TELL YOU

166
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,481
THESE PILLOWS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA?

167
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,583
OH, GOD.

168
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,585
HERE WE GO.

169
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,587
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE

170
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,989
I'M GOING TO SAY, "HI, BIRTH FATHER."

171
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,691
WE LOVE YOU, AND WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.

172
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,292
YEAH, GOOD LUCK, GOOD LUCK.

173
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,093

174
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,799
HEY, RACH, YOU, UH, YOU WANT SOME SANDWICH?

175
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,201
OH! WHAT IS IN THAT?

176
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,604
OLIVE LOAF AND HAM SPREAD, NO MAYO.

177
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,805
NO, NO, BECAUSE MAY

178
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,807
THAT WOULD MAKE IT GROSS.

179
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,308

180
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,710
HEY! NO!

181
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,811
OH! OH!

00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,429

192
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,531
OHH!

193
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:12,932

00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,739
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU JUST REACH OUT AND TAKE HIS TRAMPOLINE?

197
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:20,840
 OKAY, HERE

198
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,041
I KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO.

199
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,242
HEY, HEY! HEY, NO!

200
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,444
OKAY, DOGGIE!

00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,045
GET THE... GET THE SANDWICH!

202
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,246

203
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,448
OKAY, GO GET THE SANDWICH.

204
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,649
GET THE SANDWICH, DOGGIE.

205
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:30,650
GOOD DOGGIE!

206
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,851
GET THE SANDWICH! GET THE...

207
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:32,952
OKAY, JOEY?

208
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,153
THE DOG WILL LICK HIMSELF

209
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,155
BUT HE WILL NOT TOUCH YOUR SANDWICH.

210
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,757
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

211
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,059
WELL, IF HE'S NOT GOING TO EAT IT, I WILL.

212
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,360
ARE YOU CRAZY?

213
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,363
PHEEBS, HE'S JUST A LITTLE DOG.

214
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,364

215
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,166

216
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,369

217
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,571
HEY.

218
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,172
WHAT?

219
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,776
DO YOU HAVE TO BE A CENTURY 21 REAL ESTATE AGENT

220
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,979
TO GET TO WEAR THOSE REALLY COOL JACKETS?

221
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,782
DO YOU SAY THIS STUFF TO GIRLS?

222
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,589
H H HEY, ISN'T THAT THE GUY WHO USED TO WEAR YOUR HAT?

223
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,591
AND LOOK WHERE THEY'RE SITTING.

224
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,595
YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

225
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,997
YOU GUYS JUST WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR.

226
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,399
MAYBE WE DIDN'T MAKE IT CLEAR ENOUGH.

227
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,601
YEAH.

228
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,003
THIS COUCH BELONGS TO US.

229
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:25,705
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

230
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,707

231
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:30,510
AND THEN... AND THEN WE'LL CALL THE COUCH...

232
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,911
AND WE'LL  SEE

233
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,213
WHO IT COMES TO.

234
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,819
YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT YOU?

235
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,821
YOU ALWAYS GOT SOMETHING TO SAY.

236
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,823
WELL, THAT...

237
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:48,227
YOU KNOW WHAT I KEEP WONDERING?

238
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,630
WHY YOU TWO ARE STILL SITTING HERE.

239
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,831
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT!

240
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,634
I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS, ALL RIGHT?

241
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,235
GUNTHER!

242
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,639
THESE GUYS ARE TRY ING TO TAKE OUR SEATS.

243
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,041
FELLAS

244
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,643
THESE GUYS WERE HERE FIRST.

245
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,645
OH, I'M SORRY, DIDN'T REALIZE.

246
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,246
THERE YOU GO.

247
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:08,848
THANK YOU, GUNTHER.

248
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,453
WE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO AND DO THAT.

249
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,156
HE TOLD ON US?

250
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,158
YOU TOLD ON US?

251
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,561
WELL, PAL, YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME

252
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,363
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

253
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,265
DON'T PLAY WITH HIS THING.

254
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,267
I KNOW.

255
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:32,672
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TAKE THIS OUTSIDE.

256
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:37,877
"LET'S LET'S TAKE THIS OUTSIDE"?

257
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,279

258
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,082
WHO TALKS LIKE THAT?

259
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,885
A GUY WHO'S ABOUT TO KICK YOUR ASS

260
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,486
TALKS LIKE THAT.

261
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:48,688
YOU HAD TO ASK.

262
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,289
YEAH.

263
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,694
OKAY, OKAY, LOOK.

264
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:57,096
SEE, THE THING IS

265
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,899
WE'RE... WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIGHT YOU GUYS.

266
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,500
WELL, THEN, HERE'S THE DEAL:

267
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,702
YOU WON'T HAVE TO

268
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:05,504
SO LONG AS YOU NEVER, EVER SHOW YOUR FACES

269
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,506
IN THIS COFFEE HOUSE EVER AGAIN.

270
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,512
I THINK YOU PLAYED

271
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,114
THE GUNTHER CARD TOO SOON.

272
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,323
HEY, PHEEBS, I I THINK YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.

273
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,325
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

274
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,128
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

275
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,732
I JUST THINK THAT THIS WAS A REALLY BAD SIGN, YOU KNOW?

276
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,534
I MEAN, LIKE, "THE BEAST AT THE THRESHOLD," YOU KNOW.

277
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,538
IT'S JUST, I HAVE, LIKE, NO FAMILY LEFT.

278
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,540
I MEAN, WELL, EXCEPT FOR MY GRANDMOTHER.

279
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,142
YOU KNOW, BUT LET'S FACE IT

280
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,544
SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE AROUND FOREVER...

281
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:46,746
DESPITE WHAT SHE SAYS.

282
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,548
AND I HAVE A SISTER

283
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:53,152
WHO I'VE BARELY SPOKEN TO SINCE WE, LIKE, SHARED A WOMB.

284
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,754
YOU KNOW? I DON'T KNOW.

285
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,756
THIS IS MY REAL FATHER.

286
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,359
AND I JUST... I WANT THINGS TO BE, LIKE, JUST RIGHT.

287
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,361
YEAH, PHOEBE, I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

288
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:03,562
YEAH, WHATEVER YOU NEED.

289
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,766
HEY, YOU WANT TO GO HOME?

290
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,268
OKAY, THANKS. SORRY AGAIN.

291
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,171

292
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,477

293
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,089
T? WHAT WAS THA

294
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,894
UH...

295
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,697
I'M GUESSING THE THRESHOLD'S CLEAR NOW.

296
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,303
I WANT TO BUY FIVE SHARES OF S.G.J.

297
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,905
AND I WANT TO BUY THEM NOW.

298
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,506
COME ON, TIME IS MONEY, MY FRIEND.

299
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:48,708
THANK YOU.

300
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,710
WHOO!

301
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,112
"TIME IS MONEY, MY FRIEND"?

302
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,514
YEAH. YOU MISSED "TAKES MONEY TO MAKE MONEY"

303
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,516
AND, UH, "DON'T MAKE ME COME DOWN THERE

304
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,919
AND KICK YOUR WALL STREET BUTT."

305
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,621
HEY, I MADE $17 DOLLARS BEFORE BREAKFAST.

306
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,422
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

307
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,524
WELL, UH, I HAD BREAKFAST HERE.

308
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,526
SO, TECHNICALLY, I SAVED $3.50 DOLLARS

309
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,229
HOW DID YOU MAKE $17 DOLLARS?

310
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,933
WELL, MY FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED FRIENDS, I SPLIT MY MONEY

311
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,335
AND I BOUGHT SOME SHARES OF C.H.P. AND Z.X.Y.

312
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,337
HOW COME THOSE?

313
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:19,538
WELL, C.H.P.

314
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,341
BECAUSE I USED TO HAVE A CRUSH ON ERIK ESTRADA.

315
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:28,347
AND Z.X.Y., BECAUSE I THINK IT SOUNDS ZEXY.

316
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,750
WHAT HAPPENED  TO, UH, M.E.G.?

317
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,552
M.E.G. WAS GOOD FOR ME, BUT I DUMPED HER.

318
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,554
YOU KNOW, MY MOTTO IS

319
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,957
"GET OUT BEFORE THEY GO DOWN."

320
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,959
THAT IS SO NOT MY MOTTO.

321
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,365
HEY.

322
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,566
 HEY, PHEEBS.

323
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,168
OH, HEY, HOW'S THE DOG? YEAH.

324
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,369
OKAY, I TALKED TO THE VET.

325
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,971
PEOPLE ARE SO NICE UPSTATE. OH!

326
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,774
ANYWAY, HE SAID THAT THE LITTLE FELLA'S GOING TO BE OKAY

327
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,375
AND I CAN PICK HIM UP TOMORROW.

328
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,576
OH, GOOD.

329
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,778
OH, THANK GOD.

330
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,580
YEAH, BUT HE DID HAVE TO HAVE, LIKE, A BUNCH OF STITCHES

331
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,983
AND HE SAID THAT ONLY ONCE IN A BLUE MOON

332
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,584
DOES A DOG'S EAR GROW BACK, SO...

333
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,386
STILL HOPING.

334
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,988

335
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,390
OKAY, SO, PHOEBE

336
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,392
NOW ARE YOU GOING TO CALL YOUR DAD

337
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,394
TO LET HIM KNOW THAT HIS DOG IS OKAY?

338
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,597
I I DON'T WANT TO MEET MY FATHER OVER THE PHONE.

339
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,199
WHAT AM I GOING TO SAY?

340
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,002
LIKE, "HI. I'M PHOEBE, THE DAUGHTER YOU ABANDONED.

341
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,004
OH, BY THE WAY, I BROKE YOUR DOG."

342
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:28,607
WELL, HEY, PHEEBS, IF YOU WANT, I'LL DO IT.

343
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:29,809
OKAY.

344
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,710
LISTEN, JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING

345
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,912
ABOUT ME, OKAY?

346
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,113
ALL RIGHT.

347
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:35,915
DON'T!

348
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,118
BE TOO LONG WITH THE PHONE.

349
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,520
OKAY, SHE'LL BE A MUCH BETTER FRIEND

350
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,122
ONCE THE MARKET CLOSES.

351
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,526
IT'S A WOMAN.

352
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,228
OKAY, SO, TALK TO HER.

353
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,433
UH... HELLO, MRS. BUFFAY?

354
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,537
I KNOW WHERE YOUR DOG IS.

355
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,340
I WANT YOU TO KNOW, HE'LL BE RETURNED TO YOU

356
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,744
ALMOST AS GOOD AS NEW WITHIN... WITHIN 24 HOURS.

357
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:06,545
UH, GOOD BYE.

358
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:14,954
WHY THE VOICE?

359
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,555
HARD TO SAY.

360
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,060
YOUR CAPPUCCINO, SIR.

361
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,261
THANK YOU.

362
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,265
YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS IS

363
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,267
MUCH BETTER THAN THE COFFEE HOUSE.

364
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,468
ABSOLUTELY.

365
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,279
HOW COME IT'S NOT MIXING WITH THE WATER?

366
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,881
WELL, THE PACKAGE SAYS

367
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,482
YOU HAVE TO, UH, CONSTANTLY KEEP IT MOVING.

368
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,084
STIR AND DRINK. STIR AND DRINK.

369
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:46,685
NEVER LET IT SETTLE.

370
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,093
HEY, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

371
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,695
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT AFTER I GET BACK FROM MY NIECE'S CHRISTENING

372
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:59,098
I'LL GO DOWN TO THE COFFEE HOUSE WITH YOU

373
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,800
AND WE'LL ALL HAVE A NICE CUP OF COFFEE, ALL RIGHT?

374
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,002
NO PROBLEM.

375
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,203
JOEY'S THERE, HUH?

376
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,205
OKAY.

377
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,206
NO.

378
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,407
NO?

379
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,608
NO.

380
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,610
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO HAVE JOEY WITH ME

381
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,413
EVERY TIME I WANT A DECENT CUP OF COFFEE, YOU KNOW?

382
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,815
AND I DON'T WANT TO SP END THE REST OF MY LIFE

383
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,817
DRINKING CAPPUCCINO WITH A "K".

384
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,419
I SAY YOU AND I GO BACK DOWN THERE

385
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,620
AND STAND UP TO THOSE GUYS.

386
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,023
ALL RIGHT. HANG ON A SECOND THERE, CUSTER.

387
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,824
YEAH, REALLY.

388
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,826
ROSS, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN BEATEN UP BEFORE?

389
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,028
YEAH, SURE.

390
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,030
BY SOMEONE BESIDES MONICA?

391
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,232
NO.

392
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,634
SO WHAT? SO WHAT IF WE GET BEATEN UP?

393
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,037
MAYBE THAT'S JUST SOMETHING EVERY MAN HAS TO GO THROUGH

394
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,638
ONCE IN HIS LIFE, YOU KNOW?

395
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,640
LIKE A... LIKE A RITE OF PASSAGE OR SOMETHING.

396
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,244
WELL, COULDN'T WE JUST LOSE OUR VIRGINITIES AGAIN?

397
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,447
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I THINK, ACTUALLY, MINE'S GROWING BACK.

398
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:52,151
ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU WITH ME OR NOT? COME ON.

399
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,153
ALL RIGHT, I'M WITH YOU.

400
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,554
JUST, UH...

401
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:59,558
LET ME PUT ON A CLEAN PAIR OF UNDERWEAR FOR THE HOSPITAL.

402
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,461
NEED TO BORROW A HUNDRED BUCKS.

403
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:03,662
WHAT?

404
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:04,863
HI. WELCOME HOME.

405
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,465
I NEED TO BORROW A HUNDRED BUCKS.

406
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:07,666
FOR WHAT?

407
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,867
I GOT TO GET BACK IN THE GAME.

408
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,769
WHY? WHEN DID YOU GET OUT OF THE GAME?

409
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,371
I DON'T KNOW. I LOST IT ALL, OKAY?

410
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,772
I LOST I OH, NO.

411
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,774
HEY, I'VE COME TO TERMS WITH IT.

412
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,376
YOU HAVE TO, TOO.

413
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:18,577
OKAY.

414
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:20,980
LOOK, UH...

415
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,382
MON, I'M I'M REALLY SORRY.

416
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,184
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, WHERE ARE WE ON THE HUNDRED BUCKS?

417
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,685
I DON'T HAVE IT.

418
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,088
BUT I NEED IT!

419
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,290
OTHERWISE, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE

420
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,891
THAT HORRIBLE DINER JOB.

421
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,694
YOU KNOW, WITH THE DANCING AND THE COSTUMES.

422
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:42,501
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO WEAR FLAME RETARDANT BOOBS.

423
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,903
NOBODY DOES, HONEY.

424
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,708
HI.

425
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,709
SHNOODLE!

426
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,910
OH, MY GOD.

427
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:55,114
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO MY DOG?

428
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,116
UM, WELL, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT

429
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,118
AND, YOU KNOW, THE WOMAN WHO DID THIS

430
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,120
WOULD NEVER EVER HURT A DOG ON PURPOSE.

431
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,721
SHE'S A VEGETARIAN.

432
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:03,922
WHAT ARE THESE?

433
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,124
STITCHES?

434
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,126
YEAH, EIGHT OF THEM.

435
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,727
THAT'S 56 TO HIM.

436
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,729
YOU KNOW, ALSO, IF IT'S RAINING

437
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,331
YOU CAN'T LET  HIM LOOK UP TOO LONG

438
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:15,134
BECAUSE THAT CONE'LL FILL UP REALLY, REALLY FAST.

439
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,335
YEAH. WELL, THANKS

440
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,737
FOR BRINGING BACK WHAT'S LEFT OF HIM.

441
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,339
IS FRANK HOME?

442
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,840
HOW DO YOU KNOW FRANK?

443
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,842
JUST FROM A LONG TIME AGO.

444
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,044
IS HE HERE?

445
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,446
YEAH.

446
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,647
FRANK?

447
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,649
 YEAH?

448
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,351
WHAT?

449
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:33,552
OH, OKAY.

450
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,554
UM, I MEAN FRANK, SR.

451
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,556
HE WENT OUT FOR GROCERIES.

452
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,757
OKAY, SO WILL HE BE BACK SOON?

453
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,359
WELL, HE LEFT FOUR YEARS AGO

454
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,761
SO WE'RE EXPECTING HIM BACK ANY MINUTE NOW.

455
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,363
ALL RIGHT.

456
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,964
I'M I'M GOING TO GO.

457
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,767
I'M SORRY... ABOUT THE DOG, EVERYTHING.

458
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,769
I'M SORRY.

459
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,171
HEY, LADY.

460
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,772
HEY, WAIT UP.

461
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,778
HOW DO YOU KNOW MY DAD?

462
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,780
UM, WELL, I DON'T REALLY.

463
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,583
JUST GENETICALLY.

464
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,187
HE'S KIND OF MY DAD, TOO.

465
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,388
HEAVY.

466
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,090
YEAH.

467
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,991
SO, UM...

468
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,794
DID HE EVER TALK ABOUT ME PHOEBE?

469
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,597
NAH, BUT HE DIDN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT ANYTHING.

470
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,099
OH.

471
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,501
EXCEPT STILTS.

472
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,103
STILTS?

473
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,704
YEAH. HE LOVED STILTS.

474
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,306
THIS ONE TIME, I WAS UPSTAIRS.

475
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,109
I WAS STEALING CIGARETTES OUT OF MY MOM'S PURSE

476
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,111
AND, UH, ALL OF A SUDDEN, I LOOK OVER

477
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:36,014
AND THERE'S MY DAD'S HEAD BOBBING PAST THE WINDOW.

478
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,618
HE JUST HAD THIS BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE

479
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,421
AND HE WAS WAVING, BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS HAPPIEST

480
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,022
WHEN HE WAS ON HIS STILTS.

481
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,524
WOW.

482
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:48,026
YEAH.

483
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,429
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT.

484
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:51,730
ME NEITHER.

485
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,733

486
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,536
SO, YOU'RE, LIKE, MY BIG SISTER?

487
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,737
YEAH.

488
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,339
THIS IS HUGE.

489
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,940
YOU CAN BUY ME BEER.

490
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,942
I'M NOT GONNA.

491
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,244
OH.

492
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,445
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S COOL, THOUGH?

493
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,046
IF YOU HAD A FRIEND NAMED PETE

494
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,048
THEN I COULD SAY, "YEAH, I KNOW PETE.

495
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,050
HE'S FRIENDS WITH MY BROTHER."

496
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,852
I GOT A FRIEND NAMED MARK.

497
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,053
THAT'LL WORK, TOO.

498
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,655
COOL. ALL RIGHT.

499
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,157
SO... MAYBE, YOU KNOW

500
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:21,360
I COULD GIVE YOU A CALL SOMETIME.

501
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,163
WE COULD TALK OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW.

502
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:25,764
YEAH. THAT'D BE OKAY.

503
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:26,565
ALL RIGHT.

504
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:27,766
I'M IN THE BOOK.

505
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:28,967
OKAY, YEAH.

506
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,369
ALL RIGHT.

507
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,874
SO, UM, STILTS, HUH?

508
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:38,076
YEAH. HEY, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT, I CAN TAKE YOU AROUND BACK

509
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,479
AND SHOW YOU WHERE HE HIT HIS HEAD ON THE RAIN GUTTER.

510
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,381
OKAY.

511
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,785
WELL, WE DID IT. WE'RE HERE.

512
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,787
WE ARE STANDING OUR GROUND.

513
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,391
HOW LONG DOES A CUP OF COFFEE TAKE?

514
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,992
WOULD YOU COME ON?!

515
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,994
COME ON!

516
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,196
THANK YOU.

517
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,608
WELL, THERE WE GO.

518
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,210
I THINK WE PROVED OUR POINT.

519
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,512
YOU BURN YOUR MOUTH?

520
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,514
CANNOT FEEL MY TONGUE.

521
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,321
BULLIES. BIG BULLIES.

522
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,623
OH, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

523
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,225
IT'S THE WEENIES.

524
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,329
DID WE NOT MAKE OURSELVES CLEAR THE OTHER DAY?

525
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,431
YES, AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

526
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,433
YES. WE'RE STANDING OUR GROUND.

527
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,034
APPARENTLY.

528
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,136
LET'S DO THIS.

529
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,038
WHOA, WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE, A WEAPON?

530
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,640
IT'S A NICE WATCH.

531
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,242
I DON'T WANT TO BREAK IT ON YOUR RIBS.

532
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,644
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS.

533
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,946
QUESTION.

534
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,948
IF I DON'T CARE ABOUT MY WATCH

535
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,550
CAN I USE IT AS A WEAPON?

536
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,751
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

537
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,353
WELL, IT'S SHARP. IT'S METAL.

538
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,554
I THINK I CAN DO SOME

539
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,556
YOU KNOW, SERIOUS DAMAGE WITH IT.

540
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,158
NO, YOU CAN'T USE YOUR WATCH.

541
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,360
OKAY.

542
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,561
OR YOUR KEYS.

543
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,563
OKAY.

544
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,164
LOOK, HERE'S WHAT WE'LL DO.

545
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,766
WE'LL PUT ALL KEYS AND WATCHES

546
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,368
IN THE HAT OVER THERE.

547
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:10,769
ALL RIGHT.

548
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,972
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, MAN!

549
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,173
LET'S DO THIS ALREADY!

550
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:19,177
BEFORE I FORGET, ARE WE HITTING FACES?

551
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:19,978
OF COURSE YOU'RE HITTING FACES!

552
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,179
WHY WOULDN'T YOU HIT FACES?

553
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,181
BECAUSE I HAVE TO WORK ON MONDAY.

554
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,783
I HAVE A BIG PRESENTATION.

555
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,986
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, I GOT TO SHOW THIS APARTMENT TOMORROW

556
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,988
AND, YOU KNOW, THIS NO FACES THING

557
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,990
MIGHT NOT BE A BAD IDEA.

558
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,793
OKAY. NOTHING FROM THE NECK UP.

559
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,795
ALL RIGHT.

560
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,996
OR THE WAIST DOWN.

561
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,598
