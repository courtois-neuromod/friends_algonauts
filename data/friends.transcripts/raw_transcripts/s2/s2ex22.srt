1
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:06,306
 SO, I'LL GET CANDLES

2
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:09,209
AND MY MOM'S LACE TABLECLOTH.

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,710
AND, SINCE IT'S RACHEL'S BIRTHDAY

4
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,312
AND WE WANT  IT TO BE SPECIAL

5
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:13,913
I THOUGHT I'D POACH A SALMON.

6
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:15,915
 WHAT?

7
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:18,118
QUESTION: WHY DO WE ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE PARTIES

8
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:19,319
WHERE YOU POACH THINGS?

9
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,721
YOU WANT TO BE IN CHARGE OF THE FOOD COMMITTEE?

10
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:24,924
QUESTION TWO: WHY DO WE ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE PARTIES WITH COMMITTEES?

11
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,626
 YEAH, WHY CAN'T WE JUST GET

12
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:29,029
SOME PIZZAS AND GET SOME BEERS AND HAVE FUN?

13
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,230
YEAH, I AGREE.

14
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,232
I THINK FANCY PARTIES ARE ONLY FUN

15
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,833
IF YOU'RE FANCY ON THE INSIDE

16
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,435
AND I'M JUST NOT SURE WE ARE.

17
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,037
ALL RIGHT.

18
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,439
YOU GUYS DON'T WANT IT TO BE SPECIAL.

19
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,042
FINE. YOU CAN THROW ANY KIND OF PARTY YOU WANT.

20
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,343
JOEY, THEY'RE NOT REAL.

21
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:46,146
HUH? WHAT?

22
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:49,349
I START MILES BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THESE THINGS, OKAY?

23
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,351
THEY'RE FAKE. SEE? HONK, HONK.

24
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,353
WOW, IT'S...

25
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,156
IT'S LIKE PORNO FOR CLOWNS.

39
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,805
I TALKED TO RACHEL'S SISTERS.

40
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,407
NEITHER OF THEM CAN COME.

41
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,409
OKAY. SO I STILL HAVE TO INVITE DYLAN

42
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,010
AND EMMA AND SHANNON COOPER.

43
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,212
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

44
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,413
UH, NO SHANNON COOPER.

45
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,014
WHY NOT HER?

46
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:56,516
BECAUSE SHE, UH...

47
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,118
SHE STEALS STUFF.

48
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:04,424
OR MAYBE SHE DOESN'T STEAL STUFF AND JOEY JUST SLEPT WITH HER

49
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,326
AND NEVER CALLED HER BACK.

50
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,028
JOEY, THAT IS HORRIBLE.

51
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:11,030
HEY, I LIKED HER, ALL RIGHT?

52
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,232
MAYBE TOO MUCH.

53
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,833
I DON'T KNOW. I...

54
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,236
GUESS I JUST GOT SCARED.

55
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,537
OH, MY GOD.

56
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,139
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW.

57
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,041
I DIDN'T THINK ANYONE WOULD BUY THAT. OKAY.

58
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,845
HI, HONEY. HOW DID IT GO?

59
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,348
OH! IT WAS THE GRADUATION FROM HELL.

60
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,549
YOU KNOW, MY COUSIN WENT TO HELL

61
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,750
ON A FOOTBALL SCHOLARSHIP.

62
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,352
 YOU KNOW, I MEAN

63
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,754
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A JOYOUS OCCASION.

64
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,756
MY SISTER'S GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE.

65
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,358
NOBODY THOUGHT SHE WOULD.

66
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:41,761
IT'S A TRUE TESTAMENT TO WHAT A GIRL FROM LONG ISLAND

67
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:42,862
WOULD DO FOR A CELICA.

68
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,464
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

69
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,166
MY PARENTS HAPPENED.

70
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,568
ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS SIT IN THE SAME STADIUM

71
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,970
SMILE PROUDLY AND NOT TALK ABOUT THE DIVORCE

72
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,572
BUT NO O O O.

73
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,174
THEY GOT INTO A HUGE FIGHT

74
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,576
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS.

75
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,779
BISHOP TUTU ACTUALLY HAD TO STOP AND SHUSH THEM.

76
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:02,882
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

77
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,884
YOU KNOW WHAT THE GOOD NEWS IS?

78
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,687
I GET TO SERVE COFFEE FOR THE NEXT EIGHT HOURS.

79
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,490
OKAY, SO I GUESS WE DON'T INVITE HER PARENTS.

80
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,091
WELL, HOW ABOUT JUST HER MOM?

81
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,293
WHY HER MOM?

82
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,095
BECAUSE I ALREADY INVITED HER.

83
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,097
OOH, OOH, DID YOU ASK STACEY ROTH?

84
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:19,699
OH, CAN'T INVITE HER.

85
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,803
SHE ALSO STEALS.

86
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,210
SO DOES HER ROOMMATE.

87
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,018
OKAY, HERE ARE THE BIRTHDAY CANDLES.

88
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,620
WHERE'S THE BIRTHDAY CAKE?

89
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,622
WE'RE NOT HAVING BIRTHDAY CAKE.

90
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,224
WE'RE HAVING BIRTHDAY FLAN.

91
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,427
EXCUSE ME?

92
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,829
IT'S A TRADITIONAL MEXICAN CUSTARD DESSERT.

93
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,231
OH, THAT'S NICE.

94
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,832
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY, RACHEL.

95
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,834
HERE'S SOME GOO."

96
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,436

97
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,442
DR. GREEN.

98
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,844
OH, MY GOD, IT'S RACHEL'S DAD.

99
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,748
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

100
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,849
WHAT, THE FATHER CAN'T DROP BY

101
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,451
TO SEE THE DAUGHTER ON HER BIRTHDAY?

102
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,152
NO, NO. THE FATHER CAN.

103
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,354
BUT, UM...

104
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,555
SINCE I AM THE ROOMMATE

105
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,557
I CAN TELL YOU THAT SHE'S NOT HERE

106
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,959
AND I'LL PASS ALONG THE MESSAGE, OKAY?

107
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,160
SO BYE BYE.

108
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,563
OH! YOU'RE HAVING A PAR TY.

109
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,565
NO, NO, NOT A PARTY.

110
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:29,168
JUST A SURPRISE GATHERING OF SOME PEOPLE RACHEL KNOWS.

111
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,170
THIS IS PHOEBE AND CHANDLER AND JOEY.

112
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,172
I'LL NEVER REMEMBER ALL OF THAT.

113
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:34,774
SO, UH... WHAT'S THE DEAL?

114
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,975
RACHEL COMES HOME

115
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,477
PEOPLE POP OUT AND YELL STUFF?

116
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,078
IS THAT IT?

117
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:42,282
THIS ISN'T YOUR FIRST SURPRISE PARTY, IS IT, SIR?

118
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,285

119
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,288
HI, MONICA.

120
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,692
CHINESE MENU GUY.

121
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:53,893
FORGOT THE MENUS.

122
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,296
SO, BASICALLY, JUST A CHINESE GUY.

123
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,897

124
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:00,600
UH, HEY, DR. GREEN, WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME.

125
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,002
WE'LL PUT YOUR JACKET ON RACHEL'S BED.

126
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,205
ALL RIGHT.

127
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,207
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A TWO PERSON JOB.

128
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,212
WELL, MY GOODNESS, WHAT WAS THAT?

129
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,414
SANDRA, I AM SO SORRY.

130
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,615
I THOUGHT YOU WERE RACHEL

131
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,017
AND WE JUST WEREN'T READY FOR YOU YET.

132
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,218
YOU THOUGHT I WAS RACHEL?

133
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,121
YES, BECAUSE YOU LOOK SO YOUNG.

134
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,724
AND BECAUSE YOU'RE BOTH, YOU KNOW, WHITE WOMEN.

135
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,329
OH, I MISSED YOU KIDS.

136
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,731
WELL, SHOULD I PUT MY COAT IN THE BEDROOM?

137
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:32,932
NO!

138
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,935
NO. I'LL TAKE THAT FOR YOU.

139
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,537
OH, WELL, THANK YOU.

140
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,738
SUCH A GENTLEMAN.

141
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,939
THANK YOU.

142
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,742
OH...

143
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,644
IT ALL LOOKS SO NICE.

144
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,447
SO FESTIVE, ALL THE BALLOONS.

145
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,750
OH, THE FUNNIEST THING HAPPENED TO ME ON THE WAY HERE.

146
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,951
I WAS DRI...

147
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,153
THAT'S GREAT.

148
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,457
I CAN'T WAIT

149
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:58,658
TO HEAR THE REST OF IT

150
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,461
BUT I REALLY HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM, SO...

151
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,662
HEY, COME WITH ME.

152
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,263
WHAT?

153
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,265
YEAH, YEAH, IT'LL BE LIKE WE'RE GAL PALS

154
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,267
LIKE AT A RESTAURANT  OH, IT'LL BE FUN.

155
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,869
COME ON, COME ON.

156
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,874
OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD.

157
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,576
OKAY, THINK.

158
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,777
THINK.

159
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,779
WHAT WOULD JACK AND CHRISSY DO?

160
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:22,982
OKAY, NOW THAT YOUR COAT

161
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,785
IS SAFELY IN THE BED...

162
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,187
OKAY, WE CAN COME BACK OUT IN THE LIVING ROOM.

163
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,389
 SO, JOEY AND CHANDLER

164
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,692
IT'S TIME THAT YOU TAKE DR. GREEN OVER TO YOUR PLACE.

165
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,694
UH, YES. ABSOLUTELY.

166
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:35,495
UM...

167
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,096
WHY, AGAIN?

168
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:41,100
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE PARTY IS, YOU GOON.

169
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,303
SEE, THIS IS JUST THE STAGING AREA.

170
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:45,405
IT'S THE STAGING AREA.

171
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,006
YEAH, THIS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE

172
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,207
IS THE STAGING AREA.

173
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,209
THIS IS CLEARLY IN THE WRONG APARTMENT.

174
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:59,118
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS ARE OFF TO PARTY NUMBER ONE.

175
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,521
AND YOU... OOH, YOU

176
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,523
ARE OFF TO PARTY NUMBER TWO.

177
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,325
ALL RIGHT, FELLAS, LET'S KEEP IT MOVING.

178
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,327
LET'S KEEP IT MOVING.

179
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,929
 CHANDLER, COULD YOU

180
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,732
AT LEAST SEND SOME WOMEN TO MY PARTY?

181
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,233

182
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,835
OKAY, THAT'S ROSS.

183
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:17,837
ALL RIGHT.

184
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,739
OKAY, THEY'RE COMING. SHH!

185
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:29,148
OH... THANK YOU FOR SUCH A WONDERFUL DINNER.

186
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,950
THANKS FOR BEING BORN.

187
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,352
OH... THANK YOU FOR MY BEAUTIFUL EARRINGS.

188
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,554
THEY'RE PERFECT.

189
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:35,354
OH...

190
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:36,556
I LOVE YOU.

191
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,358
OH... NOW, YOU CAN EXCHANGE THEM

192
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,960
IF YOU WANT, OKAY?

193
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,362
NOW I LOVE YOU EVEN MORE.

194
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,268
 SURPRISE!

195
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,671
OH, MY GOSH!

196
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,772

00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,774
OH, MY GOD!

199
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:55,575
MOM!

200
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,176
THIS IS SO GREAT!

201
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,479
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SWEETIE.

202
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,680
WOW, YOU...

203
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,781
YOU!

204
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,783
I HAD NO IDEA.

205
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:04,884
REALLY?

206
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:05,685
NO, I KNEW.

207
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,286
ALL RIGHT.

208
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,388
OKAY, EVERYBODY, THERE'S FOOD AND DRINKS ON THE TABLE.

209
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,990
GO ACROSS THE HALL.

210
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,191
WHAT?

211
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:12,992
RIGHT NOW JOEY AND CHANDLER'S.

212
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,994
WHY? JUST GO.

213
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,298
 SURPRISE!

214
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,399

215
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,001

216
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,904
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SWEET PEA.

217
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:25,705
DADDY!

218
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,306

219
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,114
BOTH OF THEM ARE HERE?!

220
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,116
BOTH OF THEM?! BOTH OF THEM ARE HERE?!

221
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,718
WELL, WE COULD COUNT AGAIN.

222
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,921
OH, GOD. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING.

223
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,122
YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

224
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,525
THIS IS YOUR BIRTHDAY, THIS IS YOUR PARTY.

225
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,527
I SAY WE JUST PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER

226
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,529
AND IF THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH IT, WHO CARES?

227
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,730
I DO!

228
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,732
THAT'S WHO.

229
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,234
LOOK, ARE YOU GOING TO BE OKAY?

230
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,035
WELL, I HAVE TO BE.

231
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:57,637
I DON'T REALLY HAVE A CHOICE.

232
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,039
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I COULD LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE.

233
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,441
I GET TWO BIRTHDAY PARTIES AND TWO BIRTHDAY CAKES.

234
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:03,643
WELL, ACTUALLY...

235
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:07,647
JUST ONE BIRTHDAY FLAN.

236
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,248
WHAT?

237
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,651
IT'S A TRADITIONAL MEXICAN CUSTARD DESSERT.

238
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,252
LOOK, TALK TO MONICA.

239
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,854
SHE'S ON THE FOOD COMMITTEE.

240
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,856
I CAN'T...

241
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,061
JOE! JOE!

242
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,663
HEY, SOME GIRL JUST WALKED UP TO ME

243
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,264
AND SAID, "I WANT YOU, DENNIS"

244
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,767
AND STUCK HER TONGUE DOWN MY THROAT.

245
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,368
I LOVE THIS PARTY.

246
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:30,570
NICE!

247
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,771
QUICK VOLLEYBALL QUESTION.

248
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:32,972
VOLLEYBALL.

249
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,974
YEAH, WE SET UP A COURT IN YOUR ROOM.

250
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,777
UH, YOU DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THAT GRAY LAMP, DID YOU?

251
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,580
JOEY, A WOMAN JUST STUCK HER TONGUE DOWN MY THROAT.

252
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,181
I'M NOT EVENS LISTENING TO YOU.

253
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,183
 DENNIS!

254
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,586
OKAY, THAT'S ME.

255
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,789
LISTEN, HONEY, CAN YOU KEEP DAD OCCUPIED?

256
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,791
I'M GOING TO GO TALK TO MOM FOR A WHILE.

257
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,594
OKAY. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS FOR ANY OPENERS?

258
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,195
UH, LET'S JUST STAY CLEAR

259
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,197
OF "I'M THE GUY THAT'S DOING YOUR DAUGHTER"

260
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,799
AND YOU SHOULD BE OKAY.

261
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,000
RIGHT.

262
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,504
OKAY, PEOPLE, I WANT YOU TO TAKE A PIECE OF PAPER

263
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:06,706
HERE YOU GO

264
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,508
AND WRITE DOWN YOUR MOST EMBARRASSING MEMORY

265
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,912
AND I DO ASK THAT WHEN YOU'RE NOT USING THE MARKERS

266
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:16,916
YOU PUT THE CAPS BACK ON THEM BECAUSE THEY WILL DRY OUT.

267
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,719
HI, DR. GREEN.

268
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,721
SO... HOW'S EVERYTHING

269
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,324
IN THE, UH... VASCULAR SURGERY...

270
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,926
GAME?

271
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,128
IT'S NOT A GAME, ROSS.

272
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,530
A WOMAN DIED ON MY TABLE TODAY.

273
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,132
I'M SORRY.

274
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,736
SEE, THAT'S THE GOOD THING ABOUT MY JOB.

275
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,738
ALL THE DINOSAURS ON MY TABLE

276
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,140
ARE ALREADY DEAD.

277
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,744
LISTEN, YOU GUYS

278
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,746
I DON'T MEAN TO BE A PAIN ABOUT THIS

279
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,347
BUT I'VE NOTICED THAT SOME OF YOU

280
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,949
ARE JUST PLACING THEM ON.

281
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,751
YOU WANT TO PUSH THE CAPS...

282
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,755
UNTIL YOU HEAR THEM CLICK.

283
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,056

284
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,658
GUNTHER?

285
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,859
WHERE YOU GOING?

286
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,361
I WAS SORT OF THINKING ABOUT MAYBE...

287
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:03,963
NO! NO, YOU CAN'T GO!

288
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,164
NO, THIS IS FUN.

289
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,166
COME ON. WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED.

290
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,367
HERE. HERE'S YOUR MARKER.

291
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,973
LISTEN, IF YOU WANT TO GO, JUST GO.

292
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:17,576
NO. SHE'LL YELL AT ME AGAIN.

293
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,178
ALL RIGHT.

294
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,180
I CAN GET YOU OUT.

295
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,381
WHAT?

296
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,983
SHH.

297
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,385
IN A MINUTE, I'M GOING TO CREATE A DIVERSION.

298
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,387
WHEN I DO, WALK QUICKLY TO THE DOOR

299
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,389
AND DON'T LOOK BACK.

300
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:32,992
I THINK I NEED A DRINK.

301
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,193
I'LL GET IT FOR YOU.

302
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,394
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

303
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,195
SCOTCH.

304
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:37,396
SCOTCH.

305
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,799
ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE BACK IN TEN SECONDS

306
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,201
WITH YOUR SCOTCH ON THE ROCKS IN A GLASS.

307
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,202
NEAT.

308
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,403
COOL.

309
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,604
NO, NO, NO. NO, NO, NO.

310
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,708
"NEAT," AS IN "NO ROCKS."

311
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,510
I KNOW.

312
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,614
OH, HELLO, ROSS.

313
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,616
NOW, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

314
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:58,818
HI.

315
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:02,021
I HAVE BEEN IN THE BATHROOM.

316
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,224
STAY CLEAR OF THE SALMON MOUSSE.

317
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,830
OH... SCOTCH, NEAT.

318
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,632
YOU KNOW, THAT'S RACHEL'S FATHER'S DRINK.

319
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,135
WHOA. MINE, TOO.

320
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,737
ISN'T THAT NEAT?

321
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,139
SCOTCH NEAT.

322
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,745
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?

323
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,051
HEY EY. HEY.

324
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,453
WHERE YOU SNEAKING OFF TO, MISTER?

325
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,856
I'M GETTING MY CIGARETTES OUT OF MY JACKET.

326
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,057
NO, NO.

327
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,258
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "NO?"

328
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,061
NO. UM, SEE, BECAUSE... THAT'S THE STAGING AREA.

329
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,662
YOU GO IN THERE, IT'LL RUIN

330
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,264
THE WHOLE ILLUSION OF THE PARTY.

331
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,866
YEAH.

332
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,268
I THINK YOU TAKE YOUR SCOTCH BACK IN THERE

333
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:53,272
AND I WILL GET YOUR CIGARETTES FOR YOU, SIR.

334
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,473
GET MY GLASSES, TOO.

335
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,075
ALL RIGHTY ROO.

336
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:03,382
WHAT A GREAT MOMENT TO SAY THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME.

337
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,788
OKAY, AND THE FIRST PERSON'S

338
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,790
MOST EMBARRASS ING MEMORY IS:

339
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,692
"MONICA, YOUR PARTY SUCKS."

340
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,494
ALL RIGHT. VERY FUNNY.

341
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,496
OH, NO! OOH, OOH.

342
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,899
DID SOMEONE FORGET TO USE A COASTER?

343
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,500
WHAT?!

344
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,809
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

345
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,012
GREAT! I'M SEEING WATER RINGS AGAIN.

346
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,617
ROSS... WHOSE GLASSES ARE THOSE?

347
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,620
MINE.

348
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,622
YOU WEAR BIFOCALS?

349
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:44,924
MM HMM.

350
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,726
I HAVE A CONDITION...

351
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:48,928
APPARENTLY

352
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:52,131
THAT I REQUIRE

353
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,934
TWO DIFFERENT SETS OF FOCALS.

354
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,736
DO YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND HAS GLASSES

355
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:58,938
JUST LIKE THAT?

356
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,340
WELL, THOSE ARE VERY POPULAR FRAMES.

357
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,543
NEIL SEDAKA WEARS THEM.

358
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:10,950
I HEAR YOU CAN GET PEOPLE OUT OF HERE.

359
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:13,452
RACHEL?

360
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:14,653
YEAH?

361
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,056
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOUR BOYFRIEND SMOKES.

362
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,058
YEAH, LIKE A CHIMNEY.

363
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,460
OH, BIG SMOKER.

364
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,064
BIG, BIG SMOKER.

365
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,466
IN FACT, I'M GOING TO GO OUT INTO THE HALLWAY

366
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,468
AND FIRE UP THIS BAD BOY.

367
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,884
ARE YOU WEARING MY GLASSES?

368
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,886
YES.

369
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:53,692
I WAS JUST WARMING UP THE EARPIECES FOR YOU.

370
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,694
THANK YOU.

371
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,698
IS THAT ONE OF MY CIGARETTES?

372
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,304
YEAH.

373
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,306
YES, IT IS.

374
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,509
I WAS JUST MOISTENING THE TIP.

375
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,313
OKAY, SHE'S TAKING THE TRASH OUT

376
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,514
SO I CAN GET YOU OUT OF HERE

377
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,715
BUT IT HAS TO BE NOW.

378
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,317
SHE'LL BE BACK ANY MINUTE.

379
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,919
WHAT ABOUT MY FRIEND VICTOR?

380
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,320
NOPE. ONLY THE THREE OF YOU.

381
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,722
ANY MORE THAN THAT, SHE'LL GET SUSPICIOUS.

382
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:24,924
LET ME JUST GET MY COAT.

383
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,525
THERE ISN'T TIME.

384
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,329
YOU MUST LEAVE EVERYTHING.

385
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,132
THEY'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU NEXT DOOR.

386
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,534
IS IT TRUE THEY HAVE BEER?

387
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:39,538
EVERYTHING YOU'VE HEARD IS TRUE.

388
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,739
COULD YOU GUYS

389
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,341
PLEASE TRY TO KEEP IT DOWN?

390
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,544
WE'RE TRYING TO START A BOGGLE TOURNAMENT.

391
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,146
JOE, IF THESE PEOPLE FIND OUT

392
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,548
THEY'RE PLAYING SPELLING GAMES OVER THERE

393
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,550
THERE'LL BE NOBODY LEFT AT OUR PARTY.

394
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,355
YOU!

395
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,357
AND YOU!

396
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,558
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

397
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,859
AT MY PARTY!

398
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,461
AND GUNTHER!

399
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,767
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

400
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,769
UM...

401
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,373
OKAY, WELCOME TO THE FUN...

402
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,477
PHOEBE.

403
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,478
ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY

404
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,480
BUT THESE PEOPLE NEEDED ME.

405
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,681
THEY WORK HARD ALL WEEK.

406
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,283
IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT.

407
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,285
THEY DESERVE TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN. GO!

408
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:27,987
YOU KNOW, MY PARTY IS FUN.

409
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,590
MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE QUIETER, LESS OBVIOUS SORT OF FUN

410
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,793
BUT YOU KNOW, IF PEOPLE WOULD JUST GIVE IT A CHANCE, IT'S...

411
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,200
YOU WANT ME TO SEE A THERAPIST?

412
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,003
SWEETHEART, YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE A PROBLEM.

413
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:48,407
YOU'VE CHOSEN A BOYFRIEND EXACTLY LIKE YOUR FATHER.

414
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,009
OKAY, MOM. YOU KNOW WHAT? FINE.

415
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,210
I'LL MAKE AN APPOINTMENT

416
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,612
OKAY, BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT? RIGHT NOW, I GOT TO GO...

417
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:54,813
I GOT TO GO DO A THING.

418
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,815
DID YOU KNOW YOUR MOTHER SPENT

419
00:16:56,815 --> 00:17:00,419
$1,200 ON BONSAI TREES?

420
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,021
I FELT LIKE GULLIVER AROUND THAT PLACE.

421
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,923
OH, DADDY, I REALLY WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS

422
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,326
I REALLY DO, BUT I JUST HAVE TO...

423
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,728
I JUST HAVE TO DO SOME... SOME STUFF.

424
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,931
YOU WORK AND YOU WORK AND YOU WORK AT A MARRIAGE

425
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,334
BUT ALL HE CARES ABOUT IS HIS STUPID BOAT.

426
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,537
YOU WORK AND YOU WORK AND YOU WORK ON A BOAT...

427
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,540
HE ALWAYS RIDICULED MY POTTERY CLASSES...

428
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,942
AND YOU SAND IT AND YOU VARNISH IT...

429
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,544
BUT WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE

430
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,646
HE STILL DRINKS OUT OF THE MUGS.

431
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,048
ONE NIGHT, WITH HER YOGA

432
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,050
AND HERBRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY...

433
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,351
THE SCOTCH, THE CIGARETTES...

434
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,353
THE BONSAIS AND THE CHIHUAHUA...

435
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:35,954
I MAY HAVE ONLY BEEN IN THERAPY

436
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,956
FOR THREE WEEKS NOW, DEAR, BUT...

437
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,558
WHAT THE HELL DOES SHE WANT

438
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,759
WITH HALF A BOAT?

439
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,562
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

440
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,166
YOU CAN BE SHIRTS AND I'LL BE SKINS.

441
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,168
I'LL BE SKINS!

442
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,570

443
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,174
HEY.

444
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,576
HOW YOU HOLDING UP, THERE, TIGER?

445
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,778
OH.

446
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,181
SORRY. WHEN MY PAREN TS WERE GETTING DIVORCED

447
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,782
I GOT A LOT OF "TIGERS."

448
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:08,187
GOT A LOT OF "CHAMPS ," "CHIEFS," "SPORTS."

449
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,788
I EVEN GOT A "GOVERNOR."

450
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,591
THIS IS IT, ISN'T IT?

451
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,792
I MEAN, THIS IS WHAT

452
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,394
MY LIFE'S GOING TO BE LIKE.

453
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,597
MY MOM THERE, MY DAD THERE.

454
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,599
THANKSGIVING, CHRISTMAS.

455
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,800
SHE GETS THE HOUSE

456
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,402
HE'S IN SOME CONDO

457
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:26,205
MY SISTER'S GOING TO DECORATE WITH WICKER.

458
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,607
OH, CHANDLER, HOW DID YOU GET THROUGH THIS?

459
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,808
WELL, I RELIED

460
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:35,414
ON A CAREFULLY REGIMENTED PROGRAM OF DENIAL...

461
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,217
AND WETTING THE BED.

462
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,622
YOU KNOW, I JUST... IT'S SO WEIRD.

463
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,024
I WAS IN THERE JUST LISTENING TO THEM

464
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,026
BITCH ABOUT EACH OTHER.

465
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,230
ALL I KEPT THINKING ABOUT WAS THE FOURTH OF JULY.

466
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,433
BECAUSE IT REMINDED YOU OF THE WAY

467
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:58,036
OUR FOREFATHERS USED TO BITCH AT EACH OTHER?

468
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,638
IT'S JUST THIS THING.

469
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,441
EVERY YEAR, WE WOULD GO OUT ON MY DAD'S BOAT

470
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,443
AND WATCH THE FIREWORKS.

471
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:07,246
MOM ALWAYS HATED IT BECAUSE THE OCEAN AIR

472
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,248
MADE HER HAIR ALL BIG

473
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:12,050
MY SISTER, JILL, WOULD BE THROWING UP OVER THE SIDE

474
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,853
AND MY DAD WOULD BE UPSET BECAUSE NOBODY WAS HELPING

475
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,455
AND THEN WHEN WE DID HELP

476
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,857
HE WOULD SCREAM AT US FOR DOING IT WRONG...

477
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,260

478
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,062
BUT THEN, WHEN THE FIREWORKS STARTED

479
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,064
EVERYBODY JUST SHUT UP.

480
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,867
YOU KNOW? AND IT'D GET REALLY COLD

481
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:32,471
AND WE WOULD ALL JUST SORT OF SMUSH UNDER THIS ONE BLANKET...

482
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,674
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ANYBODY TO BRING ANOTHER ONE.

483
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,678
AND NOW, IT'S...

484
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,483
YEAH, I I KNOW.

485
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,106
 OKAY, THANKS FOR COMING.

486
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,708
I HOPE YOU GUYS HAD FUN.

487
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:13,011
ALL RIGHT, MONICA, DEAR, I'M GOING TO HIT THE ROAD.

488
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,414
NOW, I'VE LEFT MY TEN VERBS ON THE TABLE.

489
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,816
YOU BE SURE AND SEND ME THAT FINISHED POEM.

490
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,219
OKAY. WILL DO. I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME.

491
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,221
I THINK I SAW RACHEL OUT IN THE HALL?

492
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,422
OKAY, LET ME GO CHECK.

493
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,223
ALL RIGHT.

494
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,725
YOUR MOM WANTS TO SAY GOOD BYE.

495
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,327
OH, OKAY.

496
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,329
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SWEETIE.

497
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,031
OKAY.

498
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,633
UH... YOU DRIVE SAFE.

499
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,836
ROSS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

500
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,638
I'M GETTING READY

501
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,441
FOR THE WATER... SKIING.

502
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,843
BIG HUG. ONE MORE BIG HUG. COME ON.

503
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,445
ALL RIGHT, DARLING.

504
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,347
HOW ARE YOU?

505
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,351
DR. GREEN, WHERE YOU GOING?

506
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,552
TO GET MY COAT.

507
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,153
NO, NO, NO! I'LL GET THAT!

508
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:58,757
ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT! I CAN GET MY OWN COAT!

509
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:03,562

510
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,767
SORRY. WE'RE ON A MAJOR FLAN HIGH.

511
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,371
OH, NO.

512
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,373
NO, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE...

513
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,974
BECAUSE THIS IS THE STAGING AREA.

514
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,976
IT'S ALL WRONG. YOU SHOULD LEAVE.

515
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,578
YOU KNOW, JUST...

516
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:20,779
GET OUT.

517
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,783

518
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:31,890
OR PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE A CREME DE MENTHE.

519
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,191
I HAVE TO BE HEADING

520
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,793
TOWARD MY CHATEAU. THANK YOU.

521
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,994
THEN I GUESS WE'RE GOING

522
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,996
BACK INTO THE HALLWAY.

523
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,098
THANKS FOR COMING, MRS. GREEN.

524
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,910
OKAY.

525
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,713
YOU TAKE CARE.

526
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,319
OH, YOU KIDS!

527
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,121

528
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,524
WELL...

529
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:09,127
THIS IS THE BEST PARTY I'VE BEEN TO IN YEARS.

530
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,930
THANK YOU!

532
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:19,438
 OKAY, EVERYBODY, IT'S TIME FOR FLAN.

533
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,240
 YEP. GET READY FOR THE GELATINOUS FUN.

534
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,643
 KIND OF LOOKS LIKE THAT STUFF YOU GET

535
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,645
WHEN YOU GET A BAD INFECTION.

536
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:27,846

537
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,047
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

538
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,450
 OKAY, RACHEL, MAKE A SPECIAL FLAN WISH.

539
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,653
 OKAY, I'VE GOT ONE.

540
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,558

541
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,560
 HEADS UP!

542
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,964
 WOW! THOSE THINGS ALMOST NEVER COME TRUE.
