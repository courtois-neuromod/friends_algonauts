1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:03,403
It's not fair.

2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,005
It's my money!

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,707
I know, but it's what Brad wanted.

4
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:09,309
OKAY, WHICH ONE IS SHE?

5
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,510
THAT'S BRAD'S WIDOW.

6
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,711
WHY IS SHE SO UPSET?

7
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:13,313
BECAUSE SHE JUST FOUND OUT

8
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:14,514
SHE WAS CUT OUT OF THE WILL.

9
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,715
OH, DOESN'T SHE KNOW

10
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:18,518
YOU CAN'T DEFINE YOURSELF IN TERMS OF MONEY.

11
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,520
THAT IT'S ABOUT VALUES AND MORALS

12
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,323
AND YOUR ABILITY TO GIVE AND RECEIVE LOVE.

13
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:26,126
NO.

14
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,327
Oh, Drake.

15
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:28,528
I'm sorry, Amber.

16
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,631
It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.

17
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,533
I'M SORRY I'M LATE. WHAT HAPPENED?

18
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,535
WE JUST WANT TO SEE THE END.

19
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,936
I want you, Drake.

20
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,538
I know you do.

21
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,940
But you and I can never be together that way.

22
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,542
What?

23
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,944
There's something I never told you, Amber.

24
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:47,747
I'm actually... your half brother.

25
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:48,748

26
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,654
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

27
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,456
WELL, I GET THE MEDICAL AWARD

28
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,458
FOR SEPARATING THE SIAMESE TWINS.

29
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,560
THEN AMBER AND I GO TO VENEZUELA

30
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,063
TO MEET OUR OTHER HALF BROTHER, RAMON.

31
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,266
AND THAT'S WHERE I FIND THE WORLD'S BIGGEST EMERALD.

32
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,268
IT'S REALLY BIG...

33
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,869
BUT IT'S CURSED.

34
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,271
THAT'S SO COOL.

35
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,273
GOD, THAT IS GOOD TV.

48
00:01:54,013 --> 00:02:00,120
? BECAUSE YOU'RE THERE FOR ME TOO. ?

49
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,325
COME ON, PHEEBS, PLAY WITH ME.

50
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,526
NO.

51
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,128
THIS GAME IS GROTESQUE.

52
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,231
20 ARMLESS GUYS JOINED AT THE WAIST BY A STEEL BAR.

53
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:15,235
FORCED TO PLAY SOCCER FOREVER?

54
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,037
HELLO? HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION.

55
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,039
DON'T FEEL SO BAD FOR THEM.

56
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,041
AFTER THEY'RE DONE PLAYING

57
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,043
I BREAK OUT THE LITTLE PLASTIC WOMEN

58
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,446
AND EVERYBODY HAS A PRETTY GOOD TIME.

59
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,848
WHY DON'T YOU PLAY WITH YOUR ROOMMATE?

60
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,049
HE'S, UH...

61
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,852
HE'S NOT A BIG FAN OF FOOSBALL.

62
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,555
UH OH. ARE WE NOT GETTING ALONG WITH THE NEW BOY?

63
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,157
NO, HE'S ALL RIGHT.

64
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,159
HE JUST... HE SPENDS MOST OF HIS TIME IN HIS ROOM.

65
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,760
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE

66
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,962
YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN TIME TO GET TO KNOW HIM.

67
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,564
LET'S REMEDY THAT, SHALL WE?

68
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,666
WE DON'T NEED TO REMEDY THAT.

69
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,268
OH, YEAH. IT'LL BE FUN.

70
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,070
WHAT WAS THAT?

71
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,373
HI. I JUST THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE FUN

72
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,375
IF THE THREE OF US HAD SOME BEERS

73
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,976
AND GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

74
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,278
ALL RIGHT. THAT SOUNDS ALL RIGHT.

75
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,079
OH, GOOD. OKAY.

76
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,081
OH, NO, I HAVE TO GO

77
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,484
BECAUSE I'M LATE FOR MY, UM...

78
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,287
GREEN EGGS AND HAM DISCUSSION GROUP.

79
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,988
TONIGHT IT'S

80
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,791
WHY HE WOULD NOT EAT THEM ON A TRAIN.

81
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,393
HAVE FUN. BYE.

82
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,994
THAT WAS SO LAME.

83
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,596
I KNOW, YEAH.

84
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,598
OKAY, TALK TO HIM.

85
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:27,707
SO YOU THINK THAT SPEED RACER GUY GETS A LOT OF TICKETS OR...?

86
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,910
THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.

87
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,111
SO WHO BROKE UP WITH WHO?

88
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:32,912
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?

89
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,113
I BROKE UP WITH HER.

90
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,516
SHE ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT SEAN PENN

91
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,117
WAS THE CAPITAL OF CAMBODIA.

92
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,519
THAT'S GOOD, MAN.

93
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,722
WHEN EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THE CAPITAL OF CAMBODIA...

94
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,923
IS, UH...

95
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,426
IT'S NOT SEAN PENN. NOT SEAN PENN.

96
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,428
ALL RIGHT, I GOT A FUNNY ONE.

97
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,029
MY LAST GIRLFRIEND, TILLY

98
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,432
OKAY, WE'RE EATING BREAKFAST, RIGHT?

99
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,434
I MADE ALL THESE PANCAKES.

100
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,035
THERE WAS, LIKE, 50 PANCAKES.

101
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,438
ALL OF A SUDDEN, SHE TURNS TO ME, ALL RIGHT?

102
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,241
SHE SAYS, "EDDIE, I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU ANYMORE."

103
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,444
IT WAS LITERALLY LIKE SHE HAD REACHED INTO MY CHEST

104
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,247
RIPPED OUT MY HEART AND SMEARED IT ALL OVER MY LIFE.

105
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,249
NOW THERE'S LIKE THIS

106
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,450
INCREDIBLE ABYSS

107
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,051
AND I'M FALLING

108
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,253
AND I KEEP FALLING

109
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,955
AND I DON'T THINK I'M EVER GOING TO STOP.

110
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,957

111
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:21,661
THAT WASN'T SUCH A FUNNY STORY, WAS IT?

112
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,569
? AND A CRUSTY OLD MAN SAID, "I'LL DO WHAT I CAN" ?

113
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,372
? AND THE REST OF THE RATS PLAYED MARACAS. ?

114
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,775
THAT'S IT. THANKS.

115
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,377
GOOD NIGHT.

116
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,281
PHOEBE'S GOT ANOTHER JOB, RIGHT?

117
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,083
 GREAT SET TONIGHT, PHEEBS.

118
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,685
I KNOW.

119
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:48,087
WELL, WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET GOING.

120
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,289
WE SHOULD GO, TOO.

121
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,291
I'VE GOT PATIENTS AT 8:00 IN THE MORNING.

122
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:52,492
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING.

123
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,494
YOU KNOW HOW WE ALWAYS STAY AT YOUR APARTMENT?

124
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,496
I THOUGHT MAYBE TONIGHT WE'D STAY AT MY PLACE.

125
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,299
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T HAVE MY JAMMIES.

126
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,101
WELL, MAYBE YOU DON'T NEED THEM.

127
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,904
MY BABY SISTER, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

128
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,707
SHUT UP. I'M HAPPY.

129
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,709
OH, THIS IS SO NICE.

130
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,912
ALL RIGHT, I HAVE TO MAKE A SPEECH.

131
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,614
I JUST WANT TO SAY

132
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:18,217
THAT OF ALL THE GUYS THAT MONICA'S BEEN WITH

133
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,819
AND THAT IS A LOT

134
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,722
I LIKE YOU THE BEST.

135
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,324
OH, THANK YOU, PHEEBS.

136
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:25,925
THAT'S VERY SWEET.

137
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,927
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

138
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,128
SHE LIKES ME BEST.

139
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,531
AND APPARENTLY THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT.

140
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,733
NOT A LOT.

141
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,735
PHOEBE'S KIDDING.

142
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:36,936
PHOEBE'S CRAZY.

143
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,540
PHOEBE'S DEAD.

144
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,444

145
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:46,546
HI.

146
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:47,747
HI.

147
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,349
I'M LOOKING FOR EDDIE MANOACK.

148
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,351
HE'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW.

149
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,753
I'M CHANDLER. CAN I TAKE A MESSAGE

150
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,355
OR A FISH TANK?

151
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,956
THANKS.

152
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,558

00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,759
I'M TILLY.

154
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,366
OH.

155
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,168
I GATHER BY THAT "OH," THAT HE TOLD YOU ABOUT ME.

156
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:12,171
YEAH, YOUR NAME CAME UP IN A CONVERSATION

157
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,574
THAT TERRIFIED ME TO MY VERY SOUL.

158
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,478
HE'S KIND OF INTENSE, HUH?

159
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,881
YES! HEY, CAN I ASK YOU, IS EDDIE A LITTLE...?

160
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,982

OR, UH... YOU KNOW, A LITTLE ROCK 'N' ROLL?

163
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,893
COME ON IN HERE, YOU ROOMIE.

164
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,895
HELLO, TILLY.

165
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,098
EDDIE, I JUST CAME BY TO DROP OFF YOUR TANK.

166
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,501
THAT WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL OF YOU.

167
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,503
IT WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL.

168
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,208
WELL, OKAY, THEN.

169
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,710
I'M GOING TO GO.

170
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,911

171
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,713
BYE BYE.

172
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,715
BYE.

173
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,316
SO WE GETTING A FISH?

174
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,419
YOU HAD SEX WITH HER, DIDN'T YOU?

175
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,625
PHEEBS, CHECK IT OUT, CHECK IT OUT, CHECK IT OUT.

176
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,226
OH, SOAP OPERA DIGEST.

177
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,929
THAT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE DIGESTS.

178
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,331
PAGE 42, PAGE 42.

179
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:14,734
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

180
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,436
HEY! "NEW DOG ON THE BLOCK.

181
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,438
DAYS OF OUR LIVES, JOEY TRIBBIANI."

182
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,440
OOH, COOL PICTURE.

183
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,442
YEAH.

184
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,444
OH, I LOOK GOOD.

185
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,145
HEY, IS THIS TRUE?

186
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,548
THAT YOU WRITE A LOT OF YOUR OWN LINES?

187
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,950
WELL, KIND OF, YEAH.

188
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,253
LIKE REMEMBER LAST WEEK WHEN ALEX WAS IN THE ACCIDENT?

189
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,855
THE LINE IN THE SCRIPT WAS

190
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,558
"IF WE DON'T GET THIS WOMAN TO A HOSPITAL

191
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,159
SHE'S GOING TO DIE."

192
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:44,163
BUT I MADE IT, "IF THIS WOMAN DOESN'T GET TO A HOSPITAL

193
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,165
SHE'S NOT GOING TO LIVE."

194
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,167
SEE?

195
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,970
OH, OKAY, I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE.

196
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,574
AREN'T YOU AFRAID, THOUGH, THAT THE WRITERS

197
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,777
ARE GOING TO BE KIND OF MAD WHEN THEY READ THIS?

198
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,580
HUH. I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THE WRITERS.

199
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,783
THE SCRIPTS JUST KIND OF COME TO MY HOUSE.

200
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,186
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

201
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:10,790
THIS MAKES ME LOOK GOOD, WHICH MAKES THE SHOW LOOK GOOD

202
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,792
WHICH MAKES THE WRITERS LOOK GOOD.

203
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,595
SO HOW COULD THEY BE MAD ABOUT THAT?

204
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,897

205
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,700
MAKES UP MOST OF HIS OWN LINES.

206
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,702
SON OF A...

207
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,505
YEAH. WRITE THIS, JERKWEED.

208
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,206
I FALL DOWN AN ELEVATOR SHAFT?

209
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,708
WHAT THE HELL DOES THIS MEAN?

210
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,309
I FALL DOWN AN ELEVATOR SHAFT?

211
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,311
UH... I DON'T KNOW.

212
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,114
I JUST BRING THE SCRIPTS.

213
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,716
THEY CAN'T KILL ME.

214
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,118
I'M FRANCESCA'S LONG LOST SON!

215
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,420
RIGHT.

216
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,422
COULD YOU SIGN THIS?

217
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:44,824
NO. NO WAY.

218
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,425
I'M NOT SIGNING THAT.

219
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,929
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT THE PLOT OF THE SHOW.

220
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,533
HOW CAN THEY DO THIS TO ME?

221
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:59,639
ALL RIGHT, I'M JUST GOING TO GO.

222
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,240
SORRY.

223
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,648
WELL, IT WASN'T THAT MANY GUYS.

224
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,251
IF YOU CONSIDER HOW MANY GUYS THERE ACTUALLY ARE

225
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,253
IT'S A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE.

226
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,255
HEY, IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

227
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,857
I WAS JUST CURIOUS.

228
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,058
GOOD NIGHT.

229
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,259
GOOD NIGHT, RICHARD.

230
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,961
GOOD LUCK, MON.

231
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,563
BEFORE I TELL YOU

232
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,365
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME HOW MANY WOMEN

233
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,067
YOU'VE BEEN WITH.

234
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,468
TWO.

235
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,871
TWO? TWO?

236
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,674
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

237
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,476
I MEAN, HAVE YOU SEEN YOU?

238
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,679
WELL, WHAT CAN I SAY?

239
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,481
I WAS MARRIED TO BARBARA FOR 30 YEARS.

240
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,884
SHE WAS MY HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART.

241
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,085
NOW YOU.

242
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,286
THAT'S TWO.

243
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,888
TWO IT IS.

244
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,489
OKAY, TIME FOR BED.

245
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,892
I'M GOING TO GO BRUSH MY TEETH.

246
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,995
WHOA, WHOA, NOW, WAIT A MINUTE, NOW.

247
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,997
COME ON, IT'S YOUR TURN.

248
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,599
OH, COME ON.

249
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,401
YOU KNOW, I DON'T NEED THE ACTUAL NUMBER

250
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,403
JUST A BALLPARK.

251
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:08,908
OKAY, IT IS DEFINITELY LESS THAN A BALLPARK.

252
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,515
WOW, I AM SO GLAD I'M NOT MONICA RIGHT NOW.

253
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,117
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

254
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,519
SO WHAT'S... WHAT'S YOUR MAGIC NUMBER?

255
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,723
AH...

256
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,525
COME ON, YOU KNOW EVERYONE I'VE BEEN WITH.

257
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,527
ALL BOTH OF THEM.

258
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,930
WELL, THERE'S YOU...

259
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,332
BETTER NOT BE DOING THESE IN ORDER.

260
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,135
OKAY, BILLY DRESKIN...

261
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,137
PETE CARNEY...

262
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,539
BARRY...

263
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,942
AND UH... OH, PAOLO.

264
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:46,545
OH, YES, THE WIENIE FROM TURINI.

265
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:50,549
OH, HONEY, ARE YOU JEALOUS OF PAOLO?

266
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:53,352
OH, COME ON, I'M SO MUCH HAPPIER WITH YOU

267
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,354
THAN I EVER WAS WITH HIM.

268
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,455
REALLY?

269
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,057
OH, PLEASE.

270
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,860
THAT PAOLO THING WAS BARELY A RELATIONSHIP.

271
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,461
ALL IT REALLY WAS

272
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,064
WAS, YOU KNOW, MEANINGLESS ANIMAL SEX.

273
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:13,072
OKAY, YOU KNOW, THAT SOUNDED SO MUCH BETTER IN MY HEAD.

274
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,176
EDDIE, I DIDN'T SLEEP WITH YOUR EX GIRLFRIEND.

275
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,377
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SOMEONE

276
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,879
WHO SLEPT WITH HER WOULD SAY.

277
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,480
THIS IS NUTS. THIS IS CRAZY.

278
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,482
SHE CAME OVER FOR, LIKE, TWO MINUTES

279
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:26,585
DROPPED OFF A FISH TANK AND LEFT-- END OF STORY.

280
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:27,386
WHERE'S BUDDY?

281
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,188
BUDDY?

282
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,790
MY FISH, BUDDY.

283
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,492
THERE WAS NO FISH WHEN SHE DROPPED IT OFF.

284
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,694
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

285
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,295
YOU SLEEP

286
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,496
WITH MY EX GIRLFRIEND.

287
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,700
THEN YOU INSULT MY INTELLIGENCE BY LYING ABOUT IT

288
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,102
AND THEN YOU KILL MY FISH? MY BUDDY?

289
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,104
HEY, I DIDN'T KILL YOUR FISH.

290
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,106
LOOK, EDDIE...

291
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,712
WOULD YOU LOOK AT WHAT I'M DOING HERE.

292
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,714
NOW THAT CAN'T BE SMART.

293
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:01,520
SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE THIS GUY RIGHT OFF YOU

294
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,223
AND PUT HIM HERE IN MR. POCKET.

295
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,526
TANGELO?

296
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,137
THAT'S IT? THAT'S THE GIANT NUMBER

297
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,739
YOU WERE AFRAID TO TELL ME?

298
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:20,940
WELL, YEAH.

299
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,942
WELL, THAT'S NOT BAD AT ALL.

300
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,745
YOU HAD ME THINKING IT WAS LIKE A... FLEET.

301
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,147
ARE YOU REALLY OKAY WITH IT?

302
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,149
OH, HONEY, I'M FINE.

303
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,350
OH, YAY.

304
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,052

305
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,655
OKAY, ABOUT THAT TWO...

306
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,257
WHAT?

307
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:39,859
ALL RIGHT.

308
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,460
WHAT ABOUT MY TWO?

309
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,163
WELL, THAT JUST SEEMS LIKE A REALLY SMALL NUMBER.

310
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,765
RIGHT.

311
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,366
AND...?

312
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,569
AND, WELL, DON'T YOU HAVE A LOT OF WILD OATS TO SOW?

313
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,372
OR IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH ME?

314
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,974
OH, MY GOD!

315
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,575
AM I AN OAT?

316
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,377
OH, HONEY, YOU ARE NOT AN OAT.

317
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,979
I I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

318
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,981
I GUESS I'M JUST NOT... AN OAT GUY.

319
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,184
I'VE ONLY SLEPT WITH WOMEN I'VE BEEN IN LOVE WITH.

320
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,486
BUT YOU'VE ONLY SLEPT WITH TWO PEOPLE.

321
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:10,689

322
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,492
RIGHT.

323
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,297
WOW.

324
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,100
OH, WOW.

325
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,102
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU, TOO, RIGHT?

326
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,303

327
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:25,905
NOW I DO.

328
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,710
OH! ROSS...

329
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,312
ROSS, PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.

330
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,914
ROSS, YOU ARE SO MUCH BETTER

331
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,515
FOR ME THAN PAOLO EVER WAS.

332
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,918
YOU CARE ABOUT ME, YOU'RE LOVING

333
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,119
YOU MAKE ME LAUGH.

334
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,121
IF I MAKE YOU LAUGH, HERE'S AN IDEA:

335
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,123
WHY DON'T YOU INVITE PAOLO OVER

336
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,125
TO HAVE A LITTLE ROMP IN THE SACK

337
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,127
AND I'LL JUST STAND IN THE CORNER

338
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,628
AND TELL KNOCK KNOCK JOKES?

339
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,230
STOP! GOD!

340
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,631
ROSS, WHAT YOU AND I HAVE

341
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:53,833
IS SPECIAL.

342
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,235
ALL PAOLO AND I EVER HAD WAS...

343
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,536
ANIMAL SEX? ANIMAL SEX?

344
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,738

345
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,240
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

346
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,842
YOU'RE SAYING THAT, LIKE

347
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,644
THERE'S NOTHING BETWEEN US ANIMAL AT ALL?

348
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:09,248
I MEAN, THERE'S NOT EVEN, LIKE, UM... A LITTLE ANIMAL?

349
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:13,252
NOT EVEN... NOT EVEN, LIKE, LIKE... CHIPMUNK SEX?

350
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:19,959
OKAY, ROSS, TRY TO HEAR ME, OKAY?

351
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,361
HEY, I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU, OKAY?

352
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,363
IT WAS GOOD WITH PAOLO...

353
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,564
KNOCK, KNOCK.

354
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,566
BUT...

355
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:31,570
WHAT YOU AND I HAVE IS SO MUCH BETTER, OKAY?

356
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,172
WE HAVE TENDERNESS.

357
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,773
WE HAVE INTIMACY.

358
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:35,975
WE CONNECT.

359
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,977
YOU KNOW, I SWEAR

360
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:43,182
THIS IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD.

361
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,184
UNTIL NOW.

362
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,385
OH, DON'T!

363
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,690
OH, HI.

364
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,292
HI.

365
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,294
RICHARD JUST TOLD ME HE LOVED ME.

366
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,896
OH, MY GOD! I KNOW.

367
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,097
HONEY, THAT'S GREAT!

368
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,698
I KNOW.

369
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:00,900
I JUST CAN'T FIND...

370
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,501
THEY'RE IN THE TOP DRAWER.

371
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,702
HURRY.

372
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:04,904
YOU NEED ONE, TOO?

373
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,105
OH... YEAH.

374
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,107
I FOUND THEM!

375
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,113
THERE'S ONLY ONE.

376
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,714
MONICA?

377
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:16,916
HI.

378
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,117
BE RIGHT THERE.

379
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,318
WE'RE JUST, UM...

380
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,320
WE'RE TRYING TO DECIDE SOMETHING.

381
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:25,824
RACHEL?

382
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,126

383
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,128

384
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,136
HEY.

385
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,337
HEY.

386
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:41,140
THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO DECIDE SOMETHING.

387
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,142
OH, GOOD. GOOD, GOOD.

388
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:51,050
SO, IS, UM... WAS YOUR MUSTACHE

389
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,452
DID DID IT USE TO BE DIFFERENT?

390
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,755
NO.

391
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:57,957
OH.

392
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:04,363
HOW DO YOU, YOU KNOW, KEEP IT SO NEAT?

393
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,365
I HAVE A LITTLE COMB.

394
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,766
OH.

395
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,770
AND WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT?

396
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:12,972
A MUSTACHE COMB.

397
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,573
INTERESTING.

398
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:19,378
OKAY, I I WILL DO YOUR LAUNDRY FOR ONE MONTH.

399
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,980
NO!

400
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,181
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!

401
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,782
I WILL I WILL I WILL...

402
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:26,986
HEY, I WILL CLEAN THE APARTMENT FOR TWO MONTHS.

403
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,587
I'LL GIVE THIS TO YOU NOW

404
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,390
IF YOU CAN TELL ME WHERE WE KEEP THE DUSTPAN.

405
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,792

406
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,801
SO, WERE YOU IN 'NAM?

407
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,807
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT?

408
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,409
WE ARE BOTH ADULTS HERE, RIGHT?

409
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,411
WELL, THERE'S GOT TO BE A MATURE WAY

410
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,013
TO HANDLE THIS.

411
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,214
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS?

412
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,815
GOT YOU.

413
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,417
 ONE, TWO, THREE.

414
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,618
YES!

415
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:00,819

416
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,622
FINE. GO HAVE SEX.

417
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,125
THANK YOU.

418
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,527
 NO! YOU HAVE GOT IT COMPLETELY WRONG.

419
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,529
JOHN SAVAGE WAS DEER HUNTER, NO LEGS.

420
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:13,732
JON VOIGHT WAS COMING HOME, COULDN'T FEEL HIS LEGS.

421
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:14,933
NO. NO WAY.

422
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,135
YOU'VE GOT IT TOTALLY

423
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,137
THE OTHER WAY AROUND, MY FRIEND.

424
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,338
JON VOIGHT...

425
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,139
HONEY.

426
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,340
WHAT?

427
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,141

428
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,342

429
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,549
SHALL WE?

430
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,151
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

431
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,752
THEY'RE DOING IT TONIGHT.

432
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,754
WE CAN DO IT TOMORROW.

433
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,257
UH, IN THE FUTURE

434
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,460
IF I COULD SEE THE SCHEDULE BEFOREHAND...

435
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,466
SO, WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING

436
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:51,070
HE HAD STOLEN ALL THE INSOLES OUT OF MY SHOES.

437
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,271
WHY?

438
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,274
BECAUSE HE THINKS I SLEPT WITH HIS EX GIRLFRIEND

439
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,475
AND KILLED HIS FISH.

440
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,477
WHY WOULD YOU KILL HIS FISH?

441
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,583
BECAUSE SOMETIMES, PHOEBE, AFTER YOU SLEEP WITH SOMEONE

442
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,585
YOU HAVE TO KILL A FISH.

443
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,790
CHANDLER, HONEY, I'M SORRY.

444
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,593
CAN WE WATCH JOEY'S SHOW NOW, PLEASE?

445
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,494
YEAH.

446
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,295
HE'S NOT HERE YET.

447
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,397
SO? HE'S ON THE SHOW.

448
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,099
HE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS.

449
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,701
OH, I'M FINE ABOUT MY PROBLEM NOW, BY THE WAY.

450
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,303
OH, GOOD.

451
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,005
Amber...

452
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:30,509
I want you to know that I will always be there for you--

453
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,511
as a friend and as your brother.

454
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,513
Oh, Drake.

455
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,515
 What a day, huh?

456
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,318
FIRST, THE MEDICAL AWARD, NOW THIS.

457
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,121
YEAH, SOME GUYS ARE JUST LUCKY, I GUESS.

458
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,425
Dr. Ramoray, report to first floor Emergency, stat.

459
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,327

460
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,329
WELL, THEN, UH...

461
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,731
I, UH... GUESS THAT'S ME.

462
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,335
ANYONE ELSE NEED TO GO ON THE ELEVATOR?

463
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,536
DR. HORTON?

464
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,337
DR. WONG?

465
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,538
NO, NO.

466
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,940
THEY ONLY SAID YOU.

467
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,544
WELL, OKAY.

468
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:06,745
ALL RIGHT.

469
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:07,746
I LOVE YOU, DRAKE.

470
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,348
YEAH, WHATEVER.

471
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,750
OH, NO!

472
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,452
DRAKE! LOOK OUT!

473
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,953
DRAKE!

474
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,356

475
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,957
DID THEY JUST KILL OFF JOEY?

476
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,559
NO.

477
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,760

478
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,362

479
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,364
NOW, MAYBE.

480
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,965
 COME ON! OPEN UP!

481
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,567
WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

482
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,169
I DON'T FEEL LIKE TALKING.

483
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,971
 COME ON, JOEY. WE CARE ABOUT YOU.

484
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,973
 WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

485
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,376
 AND SOME OF US REALLY HAVE TO PEE.

486
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,181
SORRY, JOEY.

487
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,782
HEY...

488
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,386
LISTEN, SORRY ABOUT YOUR DEATH.

489
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,587
THAT REALLY SUCKS.

490
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,789
WE CAME OVER AS SOON AS WE SAW.

491
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,391
HOW COULD YOU NOT TELL US?

492
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,793
I DON'T KNOW. I WAS... KIND OF HOPING

493
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,395
NO ONE WOULD EVER FIND OUT.

494
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,898
WELL, MAYBE THEY COULD FIND A WAY

495
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,500
TO BRING YOU BACK.

496
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,303
NAH. THEY SAID THAT WHEN THEY FOUND MY BODY

497
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,305
MY BRAIN WAS SO SMASHED IN

498
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:10,309
THAT THE ONLY DOCTOR WHO COULD HAVE SAVED ME WAS ME.

499
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:14,313
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SOME KIND OF IRONY OR SOMETHING.

500
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,916
BUT, JOEY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.

501
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,518
YOU DON'T NEED THAT SHOW.

502
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,520
IT WAS JUST A DUMB SOAP OPERA.

503
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,023
PHOEBE, THIS WAS THE GREATEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

504
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,626
YES. I WAS GOING TO INCORPORATE THAT.

505
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:30,028
OH, GOOD. HERE'S MONICA.

506
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,531
SHE'LL HAVE SOMETHING NICE TO SAY.

507
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,734
UM, I STRAIGHTENED OUT YOUR SHOWER CURTAIN

508
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,336
SO YOU WON'T GET MILDEW.

509
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,539
WHAT? TO ME, THAT'S NICE.

510
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,441
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

511
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,042
YOU KNOW THAT.

512
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,044
NO, I DON'T.

513
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:49,648
IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU WORK YOUR WHOLE LIFE FOR SOMETHING

514
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,050
AND YOU THINK THAT WHEN YOU GET IT

515
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,654
IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE AS GOOD AS YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

516
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,656
BUT THIS SO WAS.

517
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,558
YOU KNOW, IT CHANGED EVERYTHING.

518
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,462
LIKE, THE OTHER DAY I GOT THIS CREDIT CARD APPLICATION

519
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,464
AND I WAS PREAPPROVED.

520
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,066
HUH?

521
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,370
I'VE NEVER BEEN PREAPPROVED FOR ANYTHING IN MY LIFE.

522
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,971
I'M SORRY, MAN.

523
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,573
YEAH. JOEY, HONEY, I DON'T KNOW

524
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,975
IF THIS WILL MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU

525
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,778
BUT YOU'LL ALWAYS BE PREAPPROVED WITH US.

526
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,681
NO, THAT MEANS NOTHING TO ME.

527
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,186

528
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,790
PECAN SANDIE? JUST MADE THEM.

529
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,293
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

530
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,496
WHAT ARE THESE, RAISINS?

531
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,598
UH... SURE. WHY NOT?

532
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,606
LISTEN, EDDIE, UH...

533
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:48,807

534
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,411
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT OUR CURRENT LIVING SITUATION

535
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,413
AND, UH... WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

536
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,114
I GOT A LITTLE SURPRISE.

537
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,116
LOOK, I GOT US A NEW FISHIE.

538
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,419
I NAMED HIM, UH...

539
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,921
"CHANDLER," YOU KNOW, AFTER... AFTER YOU.

540
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,634
WELL, THAT'S NOT EVEN A REAL FISH.

541
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:19,638
YOU KNOW, THAT'S A GOLDFISH CRACKER.

542
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,040
SO WHAT'S YOUR POINT, MAN?

543
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,847
OKAY, GOOD NIGHT...

544
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,650
YOU BIG FREAK OF NATURE.

545
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,367

546
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,968
HEY.

547
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:54,673
HEY.

548
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:55,874
HEY.

549
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,675
HEY.

550
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:57,876
OOH!

551
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,077
BRISK TONIGHT.

552
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,079
OH, MAN.

553
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,681
LET'S NEVER SPEAK OF THIS.

554
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:03,882
YOU GOT IT.
