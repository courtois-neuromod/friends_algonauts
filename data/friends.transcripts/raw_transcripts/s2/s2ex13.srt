576
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,169
YOU KNOW, STARRING IN A MOVIE AND ALL.

577
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,773
NOW JUST HOW BIG OF A STAR IS MARCEL?

578
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,374
IN HUMAN TERMS?

579
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,777
I'D SAY... CYBILL SHEPHERD.

580
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,580
WHOA! WHOA! REALLY?

581
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,382
SO, YOU GUYS IN THE MOVIE

582
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:46,384
OR ARE YOU JUST REALLY PARANOID?

583
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:49,588
HEY, SAL, JERRY WANTS TO KNOW

584
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,990
IF THE MONKEY'S READY FOR THE SUBWAY STUNT.

585
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,791
 UH, EXCUSE ME.

586
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,392
JERRY IS THE DIRECTOR?

587
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:55,994
WHICH ONE IS HE?

588
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,596
THE ONE IN THE DIRECTOR'S CHAIR.

589
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,098
GOTCHA.

590
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,100
PHEEBS, WALK WITH ME.

591
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,702
OKAY.

592
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,704
UM, HOW COME I'M WALKING WITH YOU?

593
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,706
WELL, WE'RE JUST GOING OVER HERE

594
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,708
SO THAT WE CAN GET AWAY FROM

595
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:12,110
THE HORRIBLE FLESH EATING VIRUS!

596
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,013
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, WOMAN, LISTEN TO ME!

597
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,616
IS HE LOOKING? IS HE LOOKING?

598
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:24,923
WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

599
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,124
HI. TELL ME.

600
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,726
I CAN'T DO CHRISSIE'S MAKEUP.

601
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,128
SHE REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SHE HAS A MOUSTACHE.

602
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:31,329
IS IT BAD?

603
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,031
IT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF HER EYEBROWS FELL DOWN.

604
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,633
GOT IT. NOW UNLESS SOMEONE

605
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,234
CONVINCES HER TO LET ME BLEACH IT

606
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:39,037
JEAN CLAUDE VAN DAMME'S GOING TO BE MAKING OUT WITH GABE KAPLAN.

607
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,039
I'LL TALK TO HER.

608
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,842
I HATE ACTORS.

609
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,645
NICE CAMOUFLAGE, MAN.

610
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,447
FOR A MINUTE THERE, I ALMOST DIDN'T SEE YOU.

611
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,051
EXCUSE ME.

612
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,053
WHOO!

613
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,455
UH... IS YOUR NAME CHANDLER?

614
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,257
UH... YES. YES, IT IS.

615
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,859
CHANDLER BING?

616
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,060
DO YOU KNOW ME

617
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,462
OR ARE YOU JUST REALLY GOOD AT THIS GAME?

618
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,064
I'M SUSIE MOSS.

619
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,466
FOURTH GRADE. GLASSES.

620
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,670
I USED TO CARRY AROUND A BOX OF ANIMAL CRACKERS LIKE A PURSE.

621
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,672
SUSIE MOSS.

622
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:15,674
RIGHT. YEAH. WOW!

623
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,275
YOU LOOK...

624
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,277
GREAT JOB GROWING UP.

625
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,478
THANK YOU.

626
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:22,881
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU'RE NOT STILL WEARING THAT DENIM CAP

627
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,482
WITH ALL THE LITTLE MIRRORS ON IT.

628
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,084
OH, RIGHT. WELL, I GRADUATED FOURTH GRADE

629
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,386
AND REALIZED I WASN'T A PIMP.

630
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,388
REMEMBER THE CLASS PLAY?

631
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,990
YOU PULLED UP MY SKIRT

632
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,793
AND THE ENTIRE AUDITORIUM SAW MY UNDERPANTS?

633
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:39,197
YES. BACK THEN, I, UH...

634
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,600
USED HUMOR AS A DEFENSE MECHANISM.

635
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,402
THANK GOD, I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE.

636
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,205
SO...

637
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:50,008
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING SINCE CHILDHOOD?

638
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:53,612
WELL, UM... I GOT A NEW BELT.

639
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,213
I WONDERED.

640
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,818
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

641
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,319
WHAT? WHAT, WHAT, WHAT, WHAT?

642
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,122
IT'S JEAN CLAUDE VAN DAMME.

643
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,323
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS IN THIS MOVIE.

644
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,524
HE IS SO HOT!

645
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:08,126
YOU THINK?

646
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,028
"THE MUSCLES FROM BRUSSELS"?

647
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,030
"WHAM BAM VAN DAMME"?

648
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,231
DID YOU SEE TIME COP?

649
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,233
NO. WAS HE ANY GOOD IN IT?

650
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:18,136
RACHEL, HE, LIKE, TOTALLY CHANGED TIME.

651
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,039
WOW! SO WHY DON'T YOU GO TALK TO HIM?

652
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,841
OH, YEAH!

653
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,243
WHAT? SO YOU GO OVER THERE, YOU TELL HIM YOU THINK HE'S CUTE.

654
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,444
WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN?

655
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:27,746
HE COULD HEAR ME.

656
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,247
OH, COME ON, MONICA.

657
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:30,849
OKAY, I'M DOING IT FOR YOU.

658
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,050
OH, RACHEL, DON'T. DON'T YOU DARE.

659
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,551
DON'T! DON'T!

660
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,153
TELL HIM I COOK!

661
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,056
EXCUSE ME. HI.

662
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,658
HI.

663
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,460
UM, THIS IS GOING TO SOUND KIND OF GOOFY

664
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,263
BUT MY FRIEND

665
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:47,165
OVER THERE--

666
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,167
WHO COOKS, BY THE WAY--

667
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,569
UM... SHE THINKS YOU'RE CUTE.

668
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,571
YOU DON'T THINK I'M CUTE?

669
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,775
I DON'T KNOW. UM...

670
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,177
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE CUTE?

671
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,982
OKAY, WE'RE KIND OF GETTING OFF THE TRACK HERE.

672
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,984
I WAS SUPPOSED TO COME HERE AND TELL YOU

673
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:07,986
MY FRIEND THINKS YOU'RE CUTE.

674
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,688
SO WHAT SHOULD I TELL HER?

675
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,289
YOU CAN TELL HER

676
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:15,293
I THINK HER FRIEND IS CUTE.

677
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,101
WHOA!

678
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,203
STEVEN HERZ WAS THE KID WHO WOULD EAT ANYTHING FOR MONEY.

679
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,406
DAVID STEIN WAS THE GUY WHO HAD NO ELBOWS.

680
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:31,209
OKAY, WELL, THEN WHO WAS THE KID THAT GOT CAUGHT MASTURBATING?

681
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,311
OKAY, THAT'S NOT WHAT HE WAS DOING.

682
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,814
ALL RIGHT? HE WAS LOOKING FOR HIS BUS MONEY.

683
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,816
 MAKEUP!

684
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,017
OH, THAT'S ME.

685
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,019
I GOT TO GO.

686
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,121
OH. UH... OKAY.

687
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,723
UM, SO LISTEN, HOW MANY TIMES

688
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,125
AM I GOING TO HAVE TO TOUCH YOU ON THE ARM

689
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,727
BEFORE YOU ASK ME ON A DATE?

690
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,731
WELL, LET'S TRY ONE MORE.

691
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,334
THERE YOU GO. SAY ERNIE'S, 8:00?

692
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,837
I'LL BE THERE. AND WHO KNOWS?

693
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:01,239
IF THINGS GO WELL, MAYBE THIS TIME

694
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,241
I'LL GET TO SEE YOUR UNDERWEAR.

695
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,449
AND NO ONE WAS AROUND TO HEAR THAT?

696
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,455
SO WHAT DID HE SAY?

697
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:20,258
UCCH! WHAT A JERK!

698
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,860
I KEPT TALKING ABOUT YOU

699
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,862
AND HE KEPT ASKING ME OUT.

700
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,463
OH.

701
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,065
I MEAN, NATURALLY

702
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,067
YOU KNOW, I SAID NO.

703
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:33,471
WELL, THANKS, ANYWAY.

704
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:35,073
HE JUST KEPT ASKING...

705
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,075
ASKING, ASKING, ASKING, ASKING, ASKING...

706
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:40,678
RACHEL, IF YOU WANT TO GO OUT WITH HIM, YOU CAN.

707
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,081
HE SOUNDS LIKE A BIG JERK TO ME

708
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,682
BUT IF THAT'S YOU WANT TO DO...

709
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,684
JEAN CLAUDE, SHE SAID YES!

710
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:47,886
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT!

711
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,489
THANK YOU.

712
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,698
AND THEN JEAN CLAUDE TOOK ME TO THAT PLACE CROSSROADS

713
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,300
AND THAT'S WHERE

714
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,302
WE HUNG OUT WITH DREW BARRYMORE.

715
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,704
OH, MAN, SHE'S SO SMOKING!

716
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:08,406
SHE'S GOT THE GREATEST SET OF...

717
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,312
NO GUYS AROUND, HUH?

718
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:16,915
DOES ANYBODY NEED ANYTHING?

719
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,516
OH, I'LL HAVE AN ESPRESSO.

720
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,018
OH, ACTUALLY, I'LL GET IT.

721
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,020
IF I ASK YOU TO, YOU'LL PROBABLY END UP

722
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,221
DRINKING IT YOURSELF.

723
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,225
THAT IS SO UNFAIR.

724
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,127
I KNOW. LIKE YOU WOULD DRINK HER COFFEE

725
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:31,529
AFTER WHAT YOU DID TO HER WITH VAN DAMME.

726
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,733
JOEY, I HAVE TO CANCEL RACQUETBALL FOR TONIGHT.

727
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:36,935
THAT WAS MARCEL'S TRAINER.

728
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,737
HE'S GOING TO LET ME HAVE HIM FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.

729
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,639
YOU'RE BLOWING ME OFF FOR A MONKEY?

730
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,641
WE CAN RESCHEDULE FOR SATURDAY.

731
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:47,245
YEAH. UNLESS YOU HOOK UP WITH A BUNCH OF PIGEONS.

732
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,448
HEY, STICK A FORK IN ME.

733
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:52,050
I AM DONE.

734
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,253
STICK A FORK WHAT?

735
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:56,855
LIKE WHEN YOU'RE COOKING A STEAK.

736
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,657
OH. OKAY. I DON'T EAT MEAT.

737
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:03,361
WELL, THEN, HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN VEGETABLES ARE DONE?

738
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,865
WELL, YOU DON'T. YOU JUST EAT THEM AND YOU CAN TELL.

739
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,466
OKAY, THEN EAT ME. I'M DONE.

740
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,671
I'VE MET THE PERFECT WOMAN.

741
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:15,673
OKAY, WE'RE SITTING ON HER COUCH

742
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:17,275
WE'RE FOOLING AROUND

743
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,576
AND THEN, SUDDENLY, SHE TURNS TO ME AND SAYS

744
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,779
"YOU EVER WANT TO DO IT IN AN ELEVATOR?"

745
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:22,981
WOW! HEY!

746
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,582
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

747
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:27,585
I BELIEVE MY EXACT WORDS WERE

748
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,487
I MEAN, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

749
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,190
HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO DO IT ON AN ELEVATOR?

750
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,491
OH, YOU JUST KNOW.

751
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,301
SHOOT! WE GOT TO GO.

752
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,703
WE GOT A RESERVATION IN 30 MINUTES.

753
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,605
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

754
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:49,207
YOU SEE, WHAT I HAD PLANNED

755
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:52,010
SHOULDN'T TAKE MORE THAN TWO, THREE MINUTES, TOPS.

756
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,512
HMM... 200 SECONDS OF PASSION.

757
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,114
WE GOT TO GO.

758
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,515
BUT...

759
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:59,417
UM...

760
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,019
HERE'S AN IDEA.

761
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,423
HAVE YOU EVER WORN WOMEN'S UNDERWEAR?

762
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:08,226
WELL, YES, ACTUALLY.

763
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:11,429
BUT, UH... THEY WERE MY AUNT EDNA'S...

764
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:16,234
AND THERE WERE THREE OF US IN THERE.

765
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:19,437
WELL, I WAS THINKING IT WOULD BE KIND OF SEXY

766
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,240
IF YOU WORE MINE TONIGHT AT DINNER.

767
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:29,847
YOU WANT ME TO WEAR YOUR PANTIES?

768
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,449
COULD YOU?

769
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,451
WELL, IF I WAS WEARING YOUR UNDERWEAR

770
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,853
THEN WHAT WOULD YOU BE WEARING?

771
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,463
YOU'RE SWELL.

772
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,468
OKAY, GOT THE MUSIC.

773
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,470
GOT THE DINNER, OH, AND CHECK IT OUT.

774
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,872
I MADE MARCEL'S FAVORITE DISH-- BANANA CAKE...

775
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:56,074
OOH! WITH MEAL WORMS.

776
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:57,275
YARGHH!

777
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,679
OHH!

778
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,881
CANDLES.

779
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,684
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN

780
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,286
HERE TONIGHT?

781
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:11,489

782
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,690
HELLO.

783
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,593
OH, HI. ARE YOU ON YOUR WAY OVER?

784
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,796
OH.

785
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,300
NO, NO, NO. I UNDERSTAND.

786
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,901
I MEAN, A MONKEY'S GOT TO WORK.

787
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,506
NO, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

788
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,309
IT'S NOT LIKE I HAD ANYTHING SPECIAL PLANNED.

789
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,311
YOU KNOW.

790
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,313
YEAH. OKAY.

791
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,914
OKAY. OKAY, BYE.

792
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:47,125
OH...

793
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,726
I'M SORRY, MAN.

794
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,328
YEAH.

795
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,431
FEEL THAT?

796
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:54,632
WHAT?

797
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,834
WE PASSED THE MOMENT WHERE WE SHOULD'VE STOPPED

798
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,236
HOLDING HANDS. OH, YEAH.

799
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,037
YEAH.

800
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,039

801
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,242
OKAY, RACHEL, WHY DON'T YOU START TALKING FIRST?

802
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,443
ALL RIGHT.

803
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,845
I FEEL THAT THIS IS TOTALLY UNJUSTIFIED.

804
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,847
SHE GAVE ME THE GREEN LIGHT.

805
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,449
I DID NOTHING...

806
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,851
DO YOU THINK I CAN'T SEE YOU

807
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,453
IN THE TV SET?

808
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,958
ALL RIGHT, MONICA, IF THERE IS SOMETHING

809
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,960
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE...

810
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,662
YOU KNOW, YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO GO OUT WITH HIM.

811
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,464
THAT IS THE MOST RIDICULOUS...

812
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,865
YOU SOLD ME OUT!

813
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,067
I DID NOT SELL YOU OUT!

814
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:29,867
YES, YOU DID!

815
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,869
WOULD YOU LET ME TALK?!

816
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,674
DID YOU JUST FLICK ME?

817
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:39,477
OKAY, WELL, YOU WOULDN'T LET ME FINISH.

818
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:40,278
AND I...

819
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:41,779
WAS JUST...

820
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,381
OWW! THAT...

821
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:44,982
HURT!

822
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:46,184
QUIT FLICKING!

823
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,385
OW!YOU STOP FLICKING!

824
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,387
YOU FLICKED ME FIRST!

825
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,888
OW! STOP IT!

826
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:52,090
OW! OW!

827
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,892
OH! ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

828
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,094
LET'S NOT DO THIS!

829
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,295
LET'S NOT DO THIS!

830
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,896
STAY CALM!

831
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,698
HAPPY THOUGHTS!

832
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:01,699
HAPPY THOUGHTS!

833
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,601
HAPPY THOUGHTS!

834
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,402
COME ON, PEOPLE!

835
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:10,608

836
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,411
OKAY, NOW I'M GOING TO KICK SOME ASS!

837
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:16,714
OW!

838
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,116
OW!

839
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,917
OW! OW! OW! OW! OW! OW!

840
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,519
OW! OW! OW! OW! OW! OW!

841
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,121
ALL RIGHT.

842
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,324
NOW, I WILL LET GO IF YOU BOTH STOP.

843
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,326
DO YOU WANT ME TO STOP SEEING HIM?

844
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,527
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

845
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:30,528
UH HUH.

846
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,130
YOU WANT ME TO JUST CALL HIM UP

847
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,132
AND TELL HIM YOU'RE SEEING HIM INSTEAD?

848
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,333
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

849
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,335
OKAY.

850
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:40,538
OH, THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT?

851
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:41,739
YES.

852
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,741
FINE.

853
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,343
FINE.

854
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,844
THERE WE GO.

855
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,045
YOU KNOW WHAT?

856
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,247
IF WE WERE IN PRISON

857
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,649
YOU GUYS WOULD BE, LIKE, MY BITCHES.

858
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,759
THANKS FOR LETTING ME TAG ALONG TONIGHT, YOU GUYS.

859
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,361
FORGET ABOUT IT.

860
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,564
HOW YOU DOING THERE, SQUIRMY?

861
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,566
I'M HANGING IN...

862
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,168
AND A LITTLE OUT.

863
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,072
SO, ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR.

864
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,074
THAT'S A REALLY EXCITING JOB.

865
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,477
I MEAN, YOU MUST HAVE A TON OF COOL RESPONSIBILITY.

866
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,479
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH CASTING.

867
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,080
SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS

868
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,682
GOING TO EAT?

869
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,586
HOW COME ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT

870
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,588
IS PUTTING THAT ICE IN MY MOUTH

871
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:34,192
AND LICKING YOU ALL OVER?

872
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,395
BECAUSE I WENT TO AN ALL BOYS HIGH SCHOOL

873
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,797
AND GOD IS MAKING UP FOR IT?

874
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:51,409
I WANT YOU RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

875
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,411
RIGHT NOW, RIGHT HERE?

876
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:56,614
DON'T YOU THINK WE'RE IN KIND OF A PUBLIC PLACE?

877
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,519
THEY DO HAVE THE SHRIMP.

878
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,423
MEET ME IN THE BATHROOM.

879
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,332
I'M GOING TO THE BATHROOM NOW.

880
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:25,142
HE LIKES TO KEEP US IN THE LOOP.

881
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:33,351
COME ON.

882
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:38,856
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE DOING THIS.

883
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:43,261
ALL RIGHT, MISTER, LET'S SEE THOSE PANTIES.

884
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,263
ALL RIGHTY.

885
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:52,470
OOH, OOH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE EVEN SEXIER?

886
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,071
WHAT?

887
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:58,075
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE YOUR SHIRT TUCKED INTO THEM.

888
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,677
OH.

889
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,279
ALL RIGHT.

890
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,882
NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU WEARING NOTHING BUT THEM.

891
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,484
TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF.

892
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,486
OKAY, BUT I HOPE YOU REALIZE

893
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,488
THIS MEANS WE'RE GOING TO MISS

894
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,890
HEARING ABOUT THE SPECIALS.

895
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,492
COME ON. HURRY, HURRY.

896
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,494
HEY, DO YOU WANT THIS DONE QUICK

897
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,095
OR DO YOU WANT IT DONE RIGHT?

898
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,097
ALL RIGHT NOW, TURN AROUND.

899
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,699
I WANT TO SEE YOU FROM BEHIND.

900
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:22,900
OKAY.

901
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,101
SOMEBODY'S BEEN DOING

902
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,504
HIS BUNS OF STEEL VIDEO.

903
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:28,506
SAY, YOU WANT ME

904
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,508
TO CLENCH ANYTHING, OR..?

905
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,113
SUSIE?

906
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,115
SUSIE!

907
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,518
THIS... IS FOR THE FOURTH GRADE.

908
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,721
HUH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

909
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,723
WHAT DO I MEAN?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN

910
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:46,824
"WHAT DO I MEAN?"

911
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,426
I MEAN UNDERPANTS, MISTER.

912
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:49,627
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.

913
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:52,129
WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

914
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:53,731
MY SKIRT!

915
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:56,934
YOU LIFTED, KIDS LAUGHING.

916
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,737
I WAS "SUSIE UNDERPANTS" TILL I WAS 18.

917
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,539
THAT WAS IN THE FOURTH GRADE!

918
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,140
HOW CAN YOU

919
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,142
STILL BE UPSET ABOUT THAT?

920
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:07,945
WELL, UM... WHY DON'T YOU CALL ME IN 20 YEARS

921
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:10,748
AND TELL ME IF YOU'RE STILL UPSET ABOUT THIS.

922
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,855
ALL RIGHT. I HOPE YOU REALIZE

923
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,257
YOU'RE NOT GETTING THESE UNDERPANTS BACK!

924
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,768
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

925
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:33,971
JUST LIKE, TWO WEEKS AGO, I WAS WATCHING SUDDEN DEATH

926
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:37,575
AND NOW I'M ON A DATE WITH JEAN CLAUDE VAN DAMME.

927
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,977
CAN YOU BEAT UP THAT GUY?

928
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:41,178
YEAH.

929
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,581
CAN YOU BEAT UP THAT GUY?

930
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,182
SURE.

931
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:46,384
THIS IS SO WILD.

932
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,286
YOU KNOW, I GOT TO ADMIT I WAS KIND OF SURPRISED

933
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:52,089
THAT YOU AGREED TO GO ON A BLIND DATE.

934
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:54,091
NORMALLY I WOULD NOT DO IT.

935
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,292
YEAH?

936
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:58,496
WELL, WHAT MADE YOU MAKE THE EXCEPTION FOR ME?

937
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,097
BECAUSE RACHEL TOLD ME

938
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:02,500
YOU WERE DYING TO HAVE A THREESOME

939
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,502

00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,020
RACHEL...

949
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,123
YOU SAY YOU'RE SORRY, OR YOUR SWEATER GETS IT.

950
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,526
OKAY, OKAY. THAT IS MY FAVORITE SWEATER.

951
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,928
THAT IS MY THIRD DATE SWEATER.

952
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:35,733
SAY YOU'RE SORRY.

953
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,535
OKAY. DO YOU WANT TO PLAY?

00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,643
WHAT ARE YOU

957
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:46,844
GOING TO DO?

958
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:50,047
YOU GIVE ME BACK MY SWEATER OR IT'S HANDBAG MARINARA.

959
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,452
YOU DON'T HAVE THE GUTS.

960
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,854
OH, YEAH? WELL, AT LEAST I WASN'T TOO CHICKEN

961
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,256
TO TELL SOME GUY I THOUGHT HE WAS CUTE.

962
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:00,458

963
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,259
OH!

OH, ALL RIGHT.

00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,670
STOP! STOP THE MADNESS!

969
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:16,874
THIS IS CRAZY.

970
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,476
WHO CAN EVEN REMEMBER

971
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,878
WHY YOU STARTED FIGHTING IN THE FIRST PLACE?

972
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:25,282

973
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:26,884
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

974
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,187
BUT STILL...

975
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:32,590
LOOK AT YOUR PURSE.

976
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,192
LOOK AT YOUR SWEATER.

977
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,395
LOOK AT YOURSELVES.

00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,202
I'LL HELP YOU FIX YOUR SWEATER.

979
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,804
I'LL HELP YOU...

980
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:49,206
THROW OUT YOUR PURSE.

981
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,911
I'M SORRY THAT I MADE YOU STOP SEEING HIM.

982
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:57,815
WELL, I'M SORRY I WENT OUT WITH HIM WHEN I KNEW YOU LIKED HIM.

983
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:03,821
I'M SORRY THAT I BORROWED YOUR GLOVES.

984
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:10,728

985
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:15,132

986
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,935

987
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:23,140

988
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,742
JOEY?

989
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,343

CHANDLER? WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE?

992
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,752
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS TOOK OFF.

00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,558
ARE YOU NAKED IN THERE?

996
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,159
WELL, NOT EXACTLY.

997
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,663
I'M WEARING PANTIES.

00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,777
WOW, TALK ABOUT YOUR BAD LUCK.

1002
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:02,580
I MEAN, THE FIRST TIME YOU TRY PANTIES

1003
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,983
AND SOMEONE WALKS OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES.

1004
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,985
I WAS NOT TRYING THEM OUT.

1005
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:10,387
SUSIE ASKED ME TO WEAR THEM.

1006
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:12,289
WELL, LET ME SEE.

1007
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:15,092

CAN'T HELP YOU. I'M NOT WEARING ANY.

1020
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,532
HOW CAN YOU NOT BE WEARING ANY UNDERWEAR?

00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:57,134
OH, I'M GETTING HEAT FROM THE GUY

1022
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,736

MARCEL JUST FINISHED HIS LAST SCENE

1037
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,294
IF YOU WANT TO GO DOWN THERE AND SAY GOOD BYE.

1038
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:59,496
UH... NO, THAT'S OKAY.

1039
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:02,700

00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,702

1041
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,303
HE'S MOVED ON.

1042

HEY, THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES, RIGHT?

1043
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:11,709
OH, MY GOD.

1044
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,410

1045
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:22,019

1046
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:25,222
? LEFT EACH OTHER ON THE WAY ?

1047
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:28,826

1048
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:35,432

1049
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:39,036

1051
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:51,048

1052
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:58,655
? LOOKS LIKE WE MADE IT... ?

1053
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,861
I'M SORRY IT DIDN'T WORK OUT BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

1054
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:04,661
OR YOU AND ME.

1055
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,965
DREW WAS... VERY DISAPPOINTED.

1056
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,168
OKAY. WELL, BYE.

1057
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,574

WELL, BYE FROM ME TOO.

1059
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:27,184

00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:31,588
OKAY. WELL, BYE BYE AGAIN.

1061
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:35,993
OKAY.

1062
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:40,798
PERHAPS THE THREE OF US JUST COULD...

1063
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,200
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

1064
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,802
ARE YOU SURE?

1065
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,403
I CAN CRUSH A WALNUT WITH MY BUTT.

1066
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:48,806
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

1067
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,407
IMPRESSIVE. BUT NO.

1068
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:52,009
MAYBE IF I WERE BAKING.

1069
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,610
OKAY.

1070
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:54,812
BYE BYE.

00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,620
SEE YOU ON THE BIG SCREEN.

1073
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:07,624
YOU KEEP PEOPLE DRINKING THAT BEER, OKAY?

1074
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:10,027
I'LL MISS YOU, BUDDY.

1075
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:33,851
YOU KNOW, I THINK I WANT TO WRITE A SONG ABOUT ALL THIS.

1076
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,052
OH, YEAH?

1077
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,454
YEAH. OOH, EXCEPT ONE OF THE STRINGS

1078
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:39,456
ON MY GUITAR IS BROKEN.

1079
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:41,859
HEY, CHANDLER, CAN I BORROW YOUR "G" STRING?

1080
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:44,661
HOW LONG YOU BEEN WAITING TO SAY THAT?

1081
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,663
ABOUT 20 MINUTES.

1082
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:51,869

1083
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,672
CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

1084
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:56,874
THIS MAN IS DYING.

1085
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,475

1086
00:47:58,475 --> 00:47:59,676

MOMMY.

00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:19,296
THIS MAN IS DEAD.
