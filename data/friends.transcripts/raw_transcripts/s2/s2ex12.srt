1
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,410
 CAN'T GET THE MONKEY OFF YOUR BACK?

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,812
THEN PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH.

3
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:15,315
WITH MONKEYSHINE BEER.

4
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:19,319
? YAY, YAY, MONKEY ?

5
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,421
? YAY, YAY, MONKEY ?

6
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,025
? MONKEY, MONKEY. ?

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,826
MONKEYSHINE BEER

8
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:28,928
BECAUSE IT'S A JUNGLE OUT THERE.

9
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,831
THAT COMMERCIAL ALWAYS MAKES ME SO SAD.

10
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:33,833
YEAH, BUT THEN, THE GUY OPENS HIS BEER

11
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,435
AND THOSE GIRLS RUN AT HIM

12
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,437
SO EVERYTHING SEEMS TO WORK OUT OKAY.

13
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:41,041
I MEANT BECAUSE THE MONKEY IN IT REMINDS ME OF MARCEL.

14
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,242
I CAN SEE THAT.

15
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:44,644
BECAUSE THEY BOTH HAVE THOSE BIG, BROWN EYES

16
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,447
AND, YOU KNOW, THE LITTLE, POUTY CHIN...

17
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:50,650
AND THE FACT THAT THEY'RE BOTH MONKEYS.

18
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,053
SOMETIMES I WONDER IF I DID THE RIGHT THING

19
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,254
YOU KNOW, GIVING HIM AWAY.

20
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:55,855
OH, ROSS, YOU HAD TO.

21
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:58,258
I MEAN, HE WAS HUMPING EVERYTHING IN SIGHT.

22
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:02,462
I MEAN, I HAVE A MALIBU BARBIE WHO WILL NO LONGER BE WEARING

23
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,064
WHITE TO HER WEDDING.

24
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,866
REMEMBER WHEN, SOMETIMES, HE'D BORROW YOUR HAT

25
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,868
AND WHEN YOU GOT IT BACK

26
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:11,671
THERE'D BE LITTLE MONKEY RAISINS IN IT?

27
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,074
GOD, HE LOVED THAT JOKE.

28
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:16,576
YEAH, SURE, WHEN HE DID IT, IT WAS FUNNY.

29
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,078
WHEN I DID IT

30
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,179
TO MY BOSS'S HAT?

31
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,380
ALL OF A SUDDEN, I HAVE

32
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,382
THIS BIG "ATTITUDE PROBLEM."

46
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,931
HEY, HEY. CHECK IT OUT.

47
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,233
GUESS WHAT I GOT.

48
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,734
RHYTHM?

49
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,937
NO. MY FIRST FAN MAIL.

50
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,539
ALL RIGHT. HEY.

51
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,342
"DEAR DR. RAMORAY: KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU

52
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,844
AND WOULD DO ANYTHING TO HAVE YOU."

53
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,045
GOSH!

54
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,648
"YOUR NOT SO SECRET ADMIRER, ERIKA FORD."

55
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,650
OH, WAIT.

56
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,155
"P.S.: ENCLOSED PLEASE FIND 14 OF MY EYELASHES."

57
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,356
YOU KNOW

58
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,859
IN CRAZY WORLD, THAT MEANS YOU'RE MARRIED.

59
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,061
THIS WASN'T ADDRESSED

60
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,663
TODAYS OF OUR LIVES.

61
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,265
THIS CAME TO YOUR APARTMENT.

62
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,466
THERE'S NO STAMP ON IT.

63
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,468
THIS WOMAN WAS IN OUR BUILDING.

64
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,069
OH, MY GOD.

65
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,872
I GOT MY VERY OWN STALKER.

66
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,376
HEY, YOU KNOW, YOU ARE SO LUCKY.

67
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,378
I HAVE TO SHARE MINE WITH A BUNCH OF GUYS

68
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,979
DOWN AT WORK.

69
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,881
OKAY, JOEY, REMEMBER WHEN WE TALKED

70
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,483
ABOUT GOOD THING, BAD THING?

71
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,684
THIS IS A BAD THING.

72
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,287
HEY, GUYS.

73
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,488
HEY.

74
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,690
WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO, TRAVELING JAKE?

75
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,092
WELL, THERE'S THIS PALEONTOLOGY CONFERENCE IN L.A.

76
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,195
SO, I FIGURED I'D GO, AND THEN DRIVE

77
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,597
DOWN TO THE ZOO AND SURPRISE MARCEL.

78
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,800
YOU KNOW, I THINK HE WILL BE SURPRISED, UNTIL HE REALIZES

79
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,402
HE'S A MONKEY

80
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,205
AND, UH, YOU KNOW, IS INCAPABLE OF THAT EMOTION.

81
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,207
 OH! PHOEBE

82
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,009
THAT REALLY CUTE GUY IS HERE AGAIN.

83
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,812
OH? OH, OKAY. SO, EVERYONE PRETEND

84
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,814
LIKE I'M TELLING YOU A STORY, OKAY?

85
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:37,617
AND IT'S REALLY FUNNY, SO EVERYONE JUST LAUGH.

86
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:38,818
NOW.

87
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,119

88
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,721
I KNOW. I KNOW.

89
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,323
HELLO.

90
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,525
HI.

91
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,726
I'M ROB DONNAN.

92
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,727
HI, ROB DONNAN.

93
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,729
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MUSIC

94
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,632
BUT I THINK YOU'RE REALLY, REALLY GREAT.

95
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,234
OH... WOW.

96
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,236
ANYWAY, I SCHEDULE PERFORMERS

97
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,038
FOR THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES AROUND THE CITY

98
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,040
AND I WAS JUST THINKING

99
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,244
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT PLAYING YOUR SONGS FOR KIDS?

100
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,046
OH, I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE KIDS.

101
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,252
...HEAR... HEAR THE... HEAR ME PLAY THE SONGS

102
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,455
THAT I WILL WRITE FOR THEM.

103
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,457
HEY, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO FOR DINNER?

104
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,959
WELL, WE COULD STAY IN AND COOK FOR OURSELVES.

105
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,961

106
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,963

107
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,766
HELLO.

108
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,967
It's Erika.

109
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,869
OH, MY GOD. THE STALKER.

110
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,271
Never mind.

111
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,573
It's open.

112
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,376
YES. HITTING HER WITH A FRYING PAN'S A GOOD IDEA.

113
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,778
WE MIGHT WANT A BACKUP PLAN, THOUGH, JUST IN CASE

114
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:39,979
SHE ISN'T A CARTOON.

115
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:43,182
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

116
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,787
THE ONE TIME THEY'RE NOT HOME.

117
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,088
OKAY. OKAY.

118
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,690
WE'LL JUST LEAVE

119
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,092
AND WHEN WE PASS HER ON THE STAIRS

120
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:56,296
SHE WON'T KNOW IT'S ME, BECAUSE WE NEVER MET.

121
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,298
THAT'S HOW RADIO STARS ESCAPE STALKERS.

122
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,400

123
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,601
SHE'S COMING.

124
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,807

125
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,008
 IT'S ME.

126
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,610
UH, THIS IS IT.

127
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,413
THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO DIE.

128
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,014
YOU READY?

129
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,215
WAIT, WAIT.

130
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,425
HI.

131
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,427
ERIKA...

132
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,837
MR. GELLER?

133
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,038
YES. HI.

134
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,441
HI. DEAN LIPSON, ZOO ADMINISTRATOR.

135
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,142
I WAS TOLD YOU HAD A QUESTION.

136
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,945
WELL, I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND THE MONKEY

137
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,447
I DONATED LAST YEAR.

138
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,849
HE'S A CAPUCHIN, ANSWERS TO THE NAME "MARCEL."

139
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,453
AH... I'M AFRAID I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.

140
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,255
MARCEL HAS PASSED ON.

141
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,459
OH, MY GOD.

142
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,660
WHAT HAPPENED?

143
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,363
WELL, HE GOT SICK, AND THEN HE GOT SICKER

144
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,964
AND THEN HE GOT

145
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:05,765
A LITTLE BETTER

146
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,967
BUT THEN HE DIED.

147
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,271
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

148
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,473
I'M SORRY, MR. GELLER

149
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:17,076
BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S AN OLD SAYING:

150
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,579
"SOMETIMES, MONKEYS DIE."

151
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,982
IT'S NOT A GREAT SAYING

152
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:26,986
BUT... IT CERTAINLY IS FITTING TODAY.

153
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:30,189
WELL, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE CALLED ME.

154
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,691
I'M SORRY.

155
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:35,294
LOOK, I KNOW THIS CAN'T BRING HIM BACK, BUT, HERE.

156
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:36,996
IT'S JUST A GESTURE.

157
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,598
ZOO DOLLARS?

158
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:42,201
YES. AND COME SEE THE BIRD SHOW AT 4:00.

159
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,002
THE MACAWS

160
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,604
WEAR HATS.

161
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,905
WELL, IT'S A LOT CUTER

162
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,907
IF YOUR MONKEY HASN'T JUST DIED.

163
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,215

164
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,417
I KNOW.

165
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,020
I CAN'T BELIEVE JOEY'S HAVING LUNCH

166
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,221
WITH HIS STALKER.

167
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,823
WHAT IS SHE LIKE?

168
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:06,626
WELL, YOU REMEMBER KATHY BATES IN MISERY?

169
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:09,829
WELL, SHE LOOKS THE... EXACT OPPOSITE OF THAT.

170
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,431
AND SHE'S NOT CRAZY?

171
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,632
OH, NO, NO, NO.

172
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,034
SHE'S A TOTAL WHACK JOB.

173
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,036
YEAH. SHE THINKS THAT JOEY

174
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,839
IS ACTUALLY DR. DRAKE RAMORAY.

175
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,840
OH, MY GOD.

176
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,643
UGH. AND HE'S GOING OUT WITH HER?

177
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,645
HE CANNOT PURSUE THIS.

178
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,448
HEY, JUST BECAUSE THIS WOMAN THINKS SHE CAN ACTUALLY SEE JOEY

179
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,850
THROUGH THE MAGICAL BOX IN HER LIVING ROOM

180
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,852
DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S NOT A PERSON.

181
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,854
I MEAN, DOES SHE NOT DESERVE HAPPINESS?

182
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,456
DOES SHE NOT DESERVE LOVE?

183
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,057
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME FOR?

184
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,059
HE'S THE ONE WHO WANTS TO BOFF THE MANIAC.

185
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,062
ARE YOU OKAY?

186
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,263
NO. UH UH.

187
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:45,465
I'M JUST... I'M NERVOUS.

188
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,068
MAYBE IF I PICTURE THEM ALL IN THEIR UNDERWEAR...

189
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,570
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

190
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,574
THAT'S KIND OF THE REASON THE LAST GUY GOT FIRED.

191
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:59,779
I'M JUST... I'M... I'M USED TO PLAYING FOR GROWNUPS.

192
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,182
YOU KNOW, THEY JUST... GROWNUPS DRINK THEIR COFFEE

193
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:06,385
AND DO THEIR GROWNUP THING, AND KIDS... LISTEN.

194
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,989
IT'S JUST A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY.

195
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,591
WHAT?

196
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,494
ARE YOU GOING TO KISS ME?

197
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,295
I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT.

198
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,097
OKAY.

199
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,603
OKAY, ALL RIGHTY, LET'S PLAY SOME TUNES.

200
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:26,806
OKAY, LET'S GO FIND OUR SEATS.

201
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,808
CHANDLER, WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUR SEATS.

202
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,409
HOLD ON A SECOND.

203
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,812
"HE THINKS HE CAN.

204
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,717
HE THINKS HE CAN."

205
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,520
AW, WHAT THE HELL.

206
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,121
"HE CAN."

207
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,224
HI, EVERYBODY. I'M PHOEBE.

208
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,927
 HI, PHOEBE.

209
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,128
OKAY.

210
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:53,533
UM, I'M GOING TO PLAY, UM, SOME SONGS ABOUT GRANDPARENTS.

211
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,333
OKAY?

212
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,335

213
00:08:56,435 --> 00:09:00,039
? NOW, GRANDMA'S A PERSON WHO EVERYONE LIKES ?

214
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,242
? SHE BOUGHT YOU A TRAIN AND A BRIGHT, SHINY BIKE ?

215
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,445
? BUT LATELY, SHE HASN'T BEEN COMING TO DINNER ?

216
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:10,049
? AND LAST TIME YOU SAW HER, SHE LOOKED SO MUCH THINNER ?

217
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,451
? NOW, YOUR MOM AND YOUR DAD ?

218
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,654
? SAID SHE MOVED TO PERU ?

219
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:18,257
? BUT THE TRUTH IS, SHE DIED, AND SOMEDAY YOU WILL, TOO ?

220
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,859
? LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA ?

221
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,460
? LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA ?

222
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,062
? LA, LA, LA, LA ?

223
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,064
? LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA ?

224
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:29,068
? LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA. ?

225
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,070
I'LL HAVE THE GRILLED SALMON

226
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,672
AND THE DOCTOR

227
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,173
WILL HAVE THE RISOTTO.

228
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,374
THANK YOU.

229
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,476
OH, DRAKE, ISN'T IT AMAZING?

230
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:41,080
YEAH, IT IS.

231
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,082
WHAT?

232
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,785
WELL, I MEAN, HERE WE SIT, DEVIL MAY CARE

233
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,386
AND JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO

234
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,189
YOU WERE REATTACHING SIMONE'S SPINAL CORD.

235
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,592
YEAH. THAT WAS A TRICKY ONE.

236
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,795
IN REALITY

237
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,297
THAT OPERATION TAKES, LIKE, OVER TEN HOURS

238
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,899
BUT THEY ONLY SHOWED IT FOR TWO MINUTES.

239
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,801
WHO'S THEY?

240
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,803

241
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,404
NO ONE.

242
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,009
OH, DRAKE, YOU ARE SO TALENTED.

243
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,611
LET ME SEE THOSE HANDS.

244
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,013
OH, THESE HANDS, THESE BEAUTIFUL HANDS.

245
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:18,818
OH, I COULD JUST EAT THEM... BUT I WON'T.

246
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:19,619
GOOD.

247
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,621
OTHERWISE, MY WATCH WOULD FALL OFF.

248
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:26,826

249
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,928
NO. SERIOUSLY.

250
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,530
THESE HANDS--

251
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,333
THESE MIRACLE, MAGICAL, LIFE GIVING HANDS--

252
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,736
OH, JUST TO BE NEAR THEM, TOUCH THEM--

253
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,738
MAYBE EVEN LICK ONE?

254
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,339
ALL RIGHT.

255
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,941
JUST ONE.

256
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,150
WOW...

257
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,752
YOU'RE GOOD AT THAT.

258
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,154

259
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,556
OH, MY GOD! SOMEONE! HE'S CHOKING!

260
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,158
IS ANYONE HERE A DOCTOR?

261
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:00,760
OH, YES.

262
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,562
YES. THE BEST DOCTOR IN ALL OF SALEM--

263
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,164
DR. DRAKE RAMORAY.

264
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,084
MEET ME IN THE NOCTURNAL HOUSE IN 15 MINUTES.

265
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,587
UH, HEY, LOOK.

266
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,992
I DON'T REALLY ENJOY BEING WITH OTHER MEN-- THAT WAY...

267
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,795
...BUT, UM, ZOO DOLLARS?

268
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,197
IT'S ABOUT YOUR MONKEY.

269
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,400
IT'S ALIVE.

270
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,216
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

271
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,218
WHY DIDN'T YOU HELP THAT MAN?

272
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,921
UH... BECAUSE I'M A NEUROSURGEON.

273
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:05,524
AND THAT WAS CLEARLY A CASE OF...

274
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,526
FOODAL CHOKAGE.

275
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,929
YOU KNOW...

276
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:13,532
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING...

277
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:14,633
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

278
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:15,835
YOU DON'T HAVE

279
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,436
TO TELL ME ANYTHING.

280
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,438
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF TO ME.

281
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:23,042
WHO AM I TO QUESTION THE GREAT DR. DRAKE RAMORAY?

282
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,243
BUT THAT'S...

283
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,645
I SHOULD JUST BE HAPPY TO BE NEAR YOU.

284
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,450
HEY WHAT?

285
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,852
THAT'S IT.

286
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,254
JUST HEY.

287
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,455
LIKE AT THE END OF A DANCE.

288
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,656
HEY!

289
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,261
HEY.

290
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,064
HEY. HEY. HEY.

291
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,466
? THERE'LL BE TIMES WHEN YOU GET OLDER ?

292
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,468
? WHEN YOU'LL WANT TO SLEEP WITH PEOPLE ?

293
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,470
? JUST TO MAKE THEM LIKE YOU ?

294
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,671
? BUT DON'T ?

295
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,577
? BECAUSE THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO ?

296
00:12:58,577 --> 00:12:59,779
EVERYBODY.

297
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,982
 ? THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT ?

298
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,084
? YOU DON'T WANT TO DO.?

299
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,286
EXCELLENT.

300
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,487
VERY INFORMATIVE.

301
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,290
NOT AT ALL INAPPROPRIATE.

302
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,092
THANK YOU FOR COMING, EVERYBODY.

303
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,494
THERE ARE COOKIES IN THE BACK.

304
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,997
THAT WAS GREAT.

305
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,399
THE KIDS LOVED YOU.

306
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,600
YAY!

307
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,602
I ROCK.

308
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:24,503
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

309
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,505
BECAUSE YOU TOLD THE TRUTH.

310
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,908
AND NOBODY EVER TELLS KIDS THE TRUTH.

311
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,709
YOU WERE INCREDIBLE.

312
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,112
BUT?

313
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,114
HOW DID YOU KNOW THERE WAS A "BUT"?

314
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,016
I SENSE THESE THINGS.

315
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:41,020
IT WAS EITHER "BUT" OR "BUTTER."

316
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,322
THE THING IS, I THINK SOME OF THE PARENTS

317
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,924
THEY WERE KIND OF HOPING

318
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,525
THAT YOU WOULD PLAY MORE SONGS

319
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,527
ABOUT, LIKE, BARNYARD ANIMALS.

320
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:49,728
I CAN DO THAT.

321
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,330
REALLY? YEAH.

322
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,332
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC.

323
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,435
WHAT?

324
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,837
YOU WANT TO KISS ME?

325
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,839
I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.

326
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,144
OKAY, SO IF I GET A LIBRARY CARD

327
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,146
CAN I TAKE YOU OUT SOMETIME?

328
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,052
WHAT?

329
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,653
I'M UNEMPLOYED.

330
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,360
AH, THE BAT.

331
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,762
AMBASSADOR OF DARKNESS.

332
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,966
FLITTING OUT OF HIS CAVE LIKE A WINGED MESSENGER.

333
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:31,770
SIGHTLESS SPECTER OF THE MACABRE.

334
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,173
BUDDY, MY MONKEY?

335
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,575
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

336
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,378
THERE WAS A BREAK IN

337
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,579
A FEW MONTHS BACK.

338
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,382
INSIDE JOB.

339
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,984
YOUR MONKEY WAS TAKEN

340
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,986
ALONG WITH A SNOWY EGRET

341
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,187
A TWO TOED SLOTH

342
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,589
AND THREE HOODED SWEATSHIRTS

343
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,591
FROM THE ZOO GIFT SHOP.

344
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:56,195
OH, MY GOD. BUT THE ZOO TOLD ME MY MONKEY WAS DEAD.

345
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,796
THE ZOO.

346
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:01,000
YOU BELIEVE EVERYTHING THE ZOO TELLS YOU?

347
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,605
THAT'S THE ONLY THING THE ZOO'S EVER TOLD ME.

348
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,008
OF COURSE, THEY'RE GOING TO SAY HE'S DEAD.

349
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,010
THEY DON'T WANT THE BAD PUBLICITY.

350
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,012
IT'S ALL A GREAT, BIG COVER UP.

351
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:16,215
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW HIGH UP THIS THING GOES?

352
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,016
THAT GUY LIPSON?

353
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,219
LIPSON KNOWS?

354
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,621
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO ELSE KNOWS?

355
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,223
NO, I ONLY KNOW LIPSON.

356
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,424
HMM.

357
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,227
LIPSON KNOWS, HUH?

358
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,129
HELLO, MR. POSSUM.

359
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,131
ENIGMA OF THE TREES

360
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,533
UPSIDE DOWN DENIZEN OF THE NIGHT.

361
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:35,734
TAUNTING GRAVITY...

362
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,736
BUDDY, MY MONKEY? MY MONKEY?

363
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,740
WORD ON THE STREET...

364
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,942
WELL, WHEN I SAY STREET

365
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,543
I MEAN THOSE LITTLE PRETEND

366
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,145
STREETS THEY HAVE HERE AT THE ZOO.

367
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,348
OF COURSE.

368
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,950
YOUR MONKEY FOUND A NEW CAREER

369
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,752
IN THE ENTERTAINMENT FIELD.

370
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,354
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

371
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,157
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

372
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:03,762
SO... WHAT IS THIS INFORMATION WORTH TO YOU, MY FRIEND?

373
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:06,165
ARE YOU TRYING TO GET ME TO BRIBE YOU?

374
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,167
MAYBE.

375
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,171
BUT YOU ALREADY TOLD ME EVERYTHING.

376
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:23,882
 CHECK IT OUT.

377
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,685
HE ACTUALLY IS THE MONKEYSHINE MONKEY.

378
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,287

379
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,088
 WELL, SO WHAT

380
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,589
ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

381
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,291
I GUESS I'M GOING TO CALL THE BEER COMPANY

382
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,093
AND TRY TO FIND OUT WHERE HE IS.

383
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,694
THAT'S WHAT I DID WHEN I LOST

384
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,696
MY CLYDESDALES.

385
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,698
OKAY, HI AGAIN.

386
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:43,402
 HI, PHOEBE!

387
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,404
TODAY, WE'RE GOING TO START WITH SOME SONGS

388
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,806
ABOUT BARNYARD ANIMALS.

389
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,210
? OH, THE COW IN THE MEADOW GOES MOO ?

390
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,112
? OH, THE COW IN THE MEADOW GOES MOO ?

391
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:56,715
? THEN THE FARMER HITS HIM ON THE HEAD AND GRINDS HIM UP ?

392
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,317
? AND THAT'S HOW WE GET HAMBURGERS ?

393
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:05,224
NOW, CHICKENS!

394
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,027
You're the only one who can save her, Drake.

395
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,228
Damn it, I'm a doctor!

396
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,829
I'm not God.

397
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,132
WELL, THERE GOES MY WHOLE BELIEF SYSTEM.

398
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,733

399
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:15,534
IT'S ERIKA.

400
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,536
OH, MY GOD! QUICK, TURN OFF THE TV.

401
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,737
NO, NO, NO.

402
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,339
WAIT, I WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

403
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,142
I GET LESLIE OUT OF THE COMA, THEN WE MAKE OUT.

404
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,143
HOW CAN THAT BE?

405
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,744
YOU WERE JUST KISSING SABRINA.

406
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:30,149
RACHEL, IT'S A WORLD WHERE JOEY IS A NEUROSURGEON.

407
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,053
HEY, ERIKA. COME ON IN.

408
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,654
HOW DID YOU GET HERE SO FAST?

409
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,256
I JUST SAW YOU IN SALEM.

410
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,657
RIGHT.

411
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,060
THEY, UH... THEY CHOPPERED ME IN.

412
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,761
WHAT'S UP?

413
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,763
WELL, AND I SEE YOU'RE HAVING A LITTLE PARTY, TOO.

414
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,365
IS SHE HERE?

415
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,566
HUH? HUH? WHO?

416
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,968
SABRINA. I KNOW ABOUT YOU TWO.

417
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:53,172
I SAW YOU TODAY, KISSING IN THE DOCTORS' LOUNGE.

418
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,974
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

419
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:56,975
THAT WAS...

420
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,177
YOU TOLD ME

421
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,179
I WAS THE ONLY ONE.

422
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,882
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, THAT'S IT.

423
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:07,086
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD SEE EACH OTHER ANYMORE, ALL RIGHT?

424
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,888
LOOK, I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THIS A LONG TIME AGO

425
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,490
BUT I AM NOT DRAKE RAMORAY, OKAY?

426
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,092
I'M NOT EVEN A DOCTOR.

427
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:13,892
I'M AN ACTOR.

428
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,894
I JUST PRETEND TO BE A DOCTOR.

429
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,496
OH, MY GOD, DO THE PEOPLE

430
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,498
AT THE HOSPITAL KNOW ABOUT THIS?

431
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,104
SOMEBODY WANT TO HELP ME OUT HERE?

432
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,506
OH, I KNOW. I KNOW.

433
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,908
Where am I?

434
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,110
University Hospital.

435
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,912
The same place you've been for the last 18 years.

436
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,116
HOW CAN YOU BE HERE AND THERE?

437
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,518
BECAUSE IT'S A TELEVISION SHOW.

438
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,820
DRAKE, WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

439
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,423
NICE GIRL.

440
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:47,126
NOT GREAT WITH CONCEPTS.

441
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,428
I'M NOT DRAKE.

442
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,229
THAT'S RIGHT.

443
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,430
HE'S NOT DRAKE.

444
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,231
HE'S...

445
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,334
HANS RAMORAY, DRAKE'S EVIL TWIN.

446
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:01,940
IS THIS TRUE?

447
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,444
YES, YES, IT IS TRUE.

448
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,446
AND I KNOW THIS BECAUSE...

449
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,448
BECAUSE HE PRETENDED TO BE DRAKE

450
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,049
TO SLEEP WITH ME.

451
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,157
 AND THEN HE TOLD ME

452
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,358
HE WOULD RUN AWAY WITH ME.

453
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,660
AND HE DIDN'T.

454
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,564
AND YOU LEFT THE TOILET SEAT UP, YOU BASTARD!

455
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,272
IS ALL THIS TRUE?

456
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,277
YES.

457
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,078
I'M AFRAID IT IS.

458
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,481
YOU DESERVE MUCH BETTER THAN ME, ERIKA.

459
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,483
YOU DESERVE TO BE WITH THE REAL DRAKE.

460
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,286
HE'S THE ONE YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH.

461
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,086
GO TO SALEM.

462
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,688
FIND HIM.

463
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,690
HE'S THE GUY FOR YOU.

464
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,891
OH, HANS.

465
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,896
HANS?

466
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,499
HANS?

467
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:01,700
YO, EVIL TWIN.

468
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,102
RIGHT.

469
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,304
GOOD BYE, ERIKA.

470
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:08,507
GOOD LUCK IN SALEM.

471
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,310
TAKE CARE.

472
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,812
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU, HANS.

473
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:21,520
ALL RIGHT. THE PEOPLE WHO THREW THE WATER...

474
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,722
HEY, HEY, HELPING YOU OUT, HELPING YOU OUT.

475
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,324
FIRED?

476
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,925
WHY?

477
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,527
THE LIBRARY BOARD HAS HAD

478
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,128
A LOT OF COMPLAINTS FROM PARENTS

479
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,931
ABOUT SOME OF THE STUFF IN YOUR SONGS.

480
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,032
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

481
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,034
THIS IS THE LIBRARY, YOU KNOW?

482
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,636
I MEAN, BOOKS, FREE SPEECH.

483
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,238
YOU KNOW, NEWSPAPERS ON STICKS.

484
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,839
I KNOW.

485
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,941
AND WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS, YOU KNOW?

486
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,142
DID YOU TELL YOUR "BOARD"

487
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,144
ABOUT HOW THE KIDS WANT TO HEAR THE TRUTH?

488
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,947
NO.

489
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,551
I SEE.

490
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:56,855
MAYBE IF YOU JUST PLAYED SOME REGULAR KIDDIE SONGS.

491
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:57,656
NO.

492
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,658
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO BE?

493
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:04,863
LIKE SOME STUPID, BIG, LIKE, PURPLE DINOSAUR?

494
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,465
I'M NOT SAYING YOU HAVE TO BE BARNEY.

495
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:07,666
WHO'S BARNEY?

496
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,275
HEY, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BELIEVE THIS.

497
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,176
OOH, LET ME GUESS.

498
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,579
WHAT? WHAT? SOME WEEBLES ACTUALLY DO FALL DOWN? HUH?

499
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,180
A STITCH IN TIME

500
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,782
NOW ONLY SAVES SEVEN?

501
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,384
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

502
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,487
WELL...

503
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,889
NEVER MIND.

504
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,291
WHAT? WHAT?

505
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,593
WELL, I TRACKED DOWN MARCEL, AND GET THIS:

506
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:35,794
HE'S HEALTHY, HE'S HAPPY

507
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,696
AND HE'S RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK

508
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,098
FILMING OUTBREAK II: THE VIRUS TAKES MANHATTAN.

509
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,300
 YOU'RE KIDDING.

510
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,901
THIS IS AMAZING.

511
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:43,702
I KNOW.

512
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:44,903
I FINALLY GET A PART ON TV

513
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,306
AND THE MONKEY'S MAKING MOVIES.

514
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,309
OKAY, RACHEL, I'M READY.

515
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,910
OKAY.

516
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:55,814
EXCUSE ME.

517
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,416
IS THIS WHERE THE SINGING LADY IS

518
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,617
WHO TELLS THE TRUTH?

519
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,820
UM... YEAH, I GUESS THAT'S ME.

520
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,221

521
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,423
SHE'S HERE!

522
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,024

523
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:15,834
? SOMETIMES MEN LOVE WOMEN ?

524
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,637
? AND SOMETIMES MEN LOVE MEN ?

525
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:21,340
? AND THEN THERE ARE BISEXUALS ?

526
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,543
? THOUGH SOME JUST SAY THEY'RE KIDDING THEMSELVES ?

527
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:28,747
? LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA ?

528
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:31,149
? LA LA LA LA LA LA- LA LA LA LA. ?

529
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:35,954
 THIS IS SO EXCITING.

530
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,556
I HAVEN'T SEEN MY MONKEY IN ALMOST A YEAR.

531
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,459
WHAT, YOU NEVER LOOK DOWN IN THE SHOWER?

532
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:41,660
OH, PLEASE.

533
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,261
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE ONE JOKE

534
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:44,863
IN THE MONKEY AS PENIS GENRE?

535
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,865
COME ON, PEOPLE, BACK UP, PLEASE.

536
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,667
BACK UP. COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

537
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,470
EXCUSE ME. WHERE CAN WE FIND THE MONKEY?

538
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,771
I'M SORRY, GUYS, IT'S A CLOSED SET.

539
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:53,972
I'M SORRY.

540
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,574
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

541
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,775
I'M I'M A FRIEND OF HIS.

542
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,777
WE, UH, WE USED TO LIVE TOGETHER.

543
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:01,980
YEAH, AND I HAVE A TIME SHARE IN THE POCONOS WITH FLIPPER.

544
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,383

545
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,084
 ROSS, THERE HE IS.

546
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:08,387
HEY, BUDDY!

547
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,988

548
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,189
MARCEL!

549
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,197

00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,400

551
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,202
? THE LION SLEEPS TONIGHT ?

552
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:30,108

553
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:33,111
