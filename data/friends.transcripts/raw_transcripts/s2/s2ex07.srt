1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:03,403
OKAY, WHAT IS IT ABOUT ME?

2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,005
DO I NOT LOOK FUN ENOUGH?

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,608
IS THERE SOMETHING... REPELLENT ABOUT ME?

4
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:10,510
SO, HOW WAS THE PARTY?

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,012
WELL, IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN WORSE.

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,014
A WOMAN LITERALLY PASSED THROUGH ME.

7
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,615
OKAY, SO WHAT IS IT?

8
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:17,217
AM I HIDEOUSLY UNATTRACTIVE?

9
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:18,718
NO, YOU ARE NOT.

10
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,320
YOU ARE VERY ATTRACTIVE.

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,722
YOU KNOW WHAT, I GO THROUGH THE EXACT SAME THING.

12
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:24,324
EVERY TIME I PUT ON A LITTLE WEIGHT

13
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:25,925
I START QUESTIONING EVERYTHING.

14
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:28,828
WHOA, WHOA.

15
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:31,231
I'VE... I'VE PUT ON A LITTLE WEIGHT?

16
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,233
DID YOU WANT TO...

17
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,834
YEAH, UH...

18
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:38,038
NO, NOT "WEIGHT."

19
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,040
YOU KNOW, MORE LIKE "INSULATION."

20
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,843
CHANDLER, I'M UNEMPLOYED, IN DIRE NEED OF A PROJECT.

21
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,245
YOU WANT TO WORK OUT?

22
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,446
I I CAN REMAKE YOU.

23
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,647
UH, YOU KNOW, I WOULD

24
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,249
BUT THAT MIGHT GET IN THE WAY

25
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,850
OF MY LYING AROUND TIME, SO...

26
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,052
PLEASE.

27
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,354
COME ON. LET HER DO IT.

28
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:55,455
ALL RIGHT, OKAY, ALL RIGHT

29
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:56,656
BUT IF WE PUT ON SPANDEX

30
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:58,658
AND MY BOOBS ARE BIGGER THAN YOURS

31
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,260
I'M GOING HOME.

32
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,761
YOUR BOOBS ARE FINE.

33
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,363
LOOK, I NEVER SHOULD HAVE SAID ANYTHING.

34
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,565
COME HERE. COME HERE.

35
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,170
OH... CAN'T... MAKE... HANDS... MEET.

49
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,426
OKAY...

50
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,027
HEY.

51
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:10,029
LET'S DO IT.

52
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,235
WHAT?

53
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,838
NOTHING. JUST NEVER SEEN YOU IN LITTLE STRETCHY PANTS BEFORE.

54
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,241
IT'S CUTE.

55
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,444
AND WE'RE CHANGING.

56
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,647

57
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,249

00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,850

59
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,454
?I'VE GOT TO BE A MACHO MAN?

60
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:38,858
? I'VE GOT TO BE A MUCHO, MUCHO MACHO, YEAH... ?

61
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:39,759

62
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,261
COME ON, GIVE ME FIVE MORE.

63
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,862
FIVE MORE!

64
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,365
NO!

65
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,966
FIVE MORE AND I'LL FLASH YOU.

66
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:47,767
ONE!

67
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,171
TWO!

68
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,774
TWO AND A HALF!

69
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,178
OKAY, JUST SHOW ME ONE OF THEM.

70
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,980
? MACHO, MACHO MAN ?

71
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,982
? I'VE GOT TO BE A MACHO MAN... ?

72
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,385
OW! OW! OW! OW! OW!

73
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,988
OW! OW! OW! OW! OW!

74
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,793
OW! OW! OW! OW! OW!

75
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,495
SHE'S INSANE.

76
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,096
THE WOMAN IS INSANE.

77
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,098
IT'S BEFORE WORK. IT'S AFTER WORK.

78
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,300
IT'S DURING WORK.

79
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,903
SHE'S GOT ME DOING BUTT CLENCHES AT MY DESK.

80
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:26,306
AND NOW, THEY WON'T BRING ME

81
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,106
MY MAIL ANYMORE.

82
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,708
JUST TELL HER YOU WANT TO STOP.

83
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,909
I CAN'T, OKAY?

84
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,911
WHILE SHE'S OUT OF WORK, I'M ALL SHE'S GOT.

85
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,714
SO THAT'S WHY I WAS THINKING MAYBE WE COULD ALL PITCH IN

86
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,316
AND BUY HER HER OWN RESTAURANT.

87
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,517

88
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,018
HEY. HEY, PHEEBS, HOW DID IT GO

89
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,220
WITH SCOTT LAST NIGHT?

90
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,421
OH, UM, IT WAS NICE.

91
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,423
TOOK HIM TO A ROMANTIC RESTAURANT.

92
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,825
ORDERED CHAMPAGNE. NICE.

93
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:47,527
THE GUY STILL WON'T PUT OUT, HUH?

94
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,230
NOPE, ZILCH, NOTHIN', HUH UH.

95
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,332
OH, SORRY, PHEEBS. SORRY, PHEEBS.

96
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,634
LOOK, I... YOU KNOW, I DON'T MIND TAKING IT SLOW.

97
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,236
I LIKE HIM A LOT.

98
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,238
YOU KNOW, HE'S REALLY INTERESTING

99
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,439
AND HE'S REALLY SWEET AND...

100
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,040
WHY WON'T HE GIVE IT UP?

101
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,344
WELL, MAYBE HE, UH, DRIVES HIS CAR

102
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,346
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD

103
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,348
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

104
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,949
NO, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

105
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,951
HE'S NOT BRITISH.

106
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,356
MAYBE HE'S GAY.

107
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,957
OH!

108
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,760
UM, NO, I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM, NO.

109
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,762
BECAUSE WE WENT, UM, DANCING THE OTHER NIGHT

110
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,164
AND JUST THE WAY HE HELD ME SO CLOSE

111
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,567
AND THE WAY HE WAS LOOKING INTO MY EYES

112
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,370
I JUST... I DEFINITELY FELT SOMETHING.

113
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,072
YEAH, BUT HOW MUCH CAN YOU TELL FROM A LOOK?

114
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,275
NO, NO, I FELT IT ON MY HIP. I COULD TELL.

115
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,679
YO, BING!

116
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,281

117
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,182
JOEY, BE A PAL.

118
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,985
LIFT UP MY HAND AND SMACK HER WITH IT.

119
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,589
OH, OH, RACHEL, DON'T LOOK.

120
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,190
WHAT?

121
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,593
COME ON, YOU GUYS, I DON'T CARE.

122
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,595
I HAVE A DATE TONIGHT.

123
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:56,996

WELL, YOU KNOW, AS MUCH FUN AS THAT WAS

129
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,709
I'VE DECIDED TO OPT FOR SANITY.

130
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,911
SO, YOU'RE REALLY OKAY ABOUT ALL THIS?

131
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,514
OH, YEAH. COME ON. I'M MOVING ON.

132
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,016
HE CAN PRESS HER UP AGAINST THAT WINDOW

133
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,618
AS MUCH AS HE WANTS.

134
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,219
FOR ALL I CARE

135
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,622
HE CAN THROW HER THROUGH THE DAMN THING.

136
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,624
HI, GUYS.

137
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,825

HOPEFULLY.

158
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,164
WELL... WHOA! LOOK AT THAT!

159
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,766
I GOT TO GO. I GOT A DATE.

160
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,967

OKAY, WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TAKE THESE

166
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,182
WHEN WE LEAVE HERE.

167
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,791
I DON'T KNOW IF MONICA TOLD YOU

168
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,193
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST DATE I'VE GONE ON

169
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,795
SINCE MY DIVORCE.

170
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,397
SO, IF I SEEM A LITTLE NERVOUS

171
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,598
I AM.

172
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,000
HOW LONG DO CATS LIVE?

173
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,803
I'M SORRY?

174
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,805
CATS. HOW LONG DO THEY LIVE?

175
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,407
FIGURING YOU DON'T, YOU KNOW

176
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,409
THROW THEM UNDER A BUS OR SOMETHING.

177
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,413
UM... MAYBE 15, 16 YEARS.

178
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,815
WELL, THAT'S JUST GREAT.

179
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,017
UH, CHEERS!

180
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,619

MONICA TOLD YOU I WAS CUTER THAN THIS, DIDN'T SHE?

183
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,232
OH, NO, MICHAEL.

184
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,434
IT'S NOT YOU.

185
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,035
I'M SORRY, IT'S JUST...

186
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,236
IT'S THIS THING.

187
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:20,039
IT'S PROBABLY NOT AS BAD AS IT SOUNDS

188
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,842
BUT THIS FRIEND OF MINE IS IS GETTING A CAT

189
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,043

00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,248
HUH.

193
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:35,254

194
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,657

00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,659
YEAH, HE WISHES.

196
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,663
OH, I'M SORRY.

197
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:44,664
LOOK AT ME.

198
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:45,865
OKAY, MICHAEL...

199
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,467
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU.

200
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,768
ALL RIGHT.

201
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,770
OKAY? OKAY.

202
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,371
SO...

203
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,375
YOU EVER GET A PET WITH A GIRLFRIEND?

204
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,279
SO, I FIGURED IT OUT.

205
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,481
WHAT?

206
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,883
WHY SCOTT DOESN'T WANT TO SLEEP WITH ME.

207
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,885
IT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT SEXY ENOUGH.

208
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,187
OH, PHOEBE, THAT'S CRAZY.

209
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,789
WHEN I FIRST MET YOU

210
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,390
YOU KNOW WHAT I SAID TO CHANDLER?

211
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,592
UH UH.

212
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,994
I SAID, "EXCELLENT BUTT, GREAT RACK."

213
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,197
REALLY?

214
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,600
THAT'S SO SWEET.

215
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,004
I MEAN, I'M OFFICIALLY OFFENDED

216
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,606
BUT IT'S SO SWEET.

217
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:27,807
PHEEBS, LOOK.

218
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,809
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE DEAL IS

219
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,811
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO ASK HIM.

220
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,913
YOU'RE RIGHT.

221
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,114
YOU'RE RIGHT.

222
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,315
YOU ARE SO "YUM."

223
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,037
I MEAN, IT'S A CAT, YOU KNOW?

224
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,439
IT'S A... IT'S A CAT.

225
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,342
WHY CAN'T THEY GET ONE OF THOSE BUGS?

226
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,944
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THOSE FRUIT FLIES.

227
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,145
THOSE THINGS THAT LIVE

228
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,146
FOR, LIKE, A DAY OR SOMETHING.

229
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,148
WHAT ARE THEY CALLED? WHAT ARE THEY CALLED?

230
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:09,949
WHAT ARE THEY CALLED?

231
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,851
FRUIT FLIES?

232
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,252
YES!

233
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,453
THANK YOU.

234
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,055
SO, WOULD YOU LIKE ANY DESSERT?

235
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,256
NO!

236
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,457
NO DESSERT.

237
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,860
JUST THE CHECK... PLEASE.

238
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,461
OH, NO.

239
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,864
YOU'RE NOT HAVING FUN, ARE YOU?

240
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,365
NO, NO, I AM.

241
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:29,569
BUT ONLY BECAUSE, FOR THE LAST HOUR AND A HALF

242
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,772
I'VE BEEN PLAYING THE MOVIE DINER IN MY HEAD.

243
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,774
OH, LOOK AT ME.

244
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,776
LOOK AT ME.

245
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:40,379
I'M ON A DATE WITH A REALLY GREAT GUY.

246
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,381
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS ROSS

247
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,184
AND HIS CAT

248
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,786
AND HIS JULIE.

249
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,989
LOOK, DO YOU WANT A PIECE OF PIE OR SOMETHING?

250
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:53,192
NO!

251
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,093

252
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,294
TOO LATE FOR THAT.

253
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,697
MAN, I'VE JUST... I'VE SCREWED THIS ALL UP.

254
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,298
I JUST WANT TO GET OVER HIM.

255
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,101
GOD, I JUST WANT... WHY CAN'T I DO THAT?

256
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,002
OY!

257
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,004
LOOK, I'VE BEEN THROUGH A DIVORCE.

258
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,006
TRUST ME, YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.

259
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,608
YOU JUST CAN'T SEE IT NOW

260
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,610
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T HAD ANY CLOSURE.

261
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,011
OH!

262
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,613
CLOSURE.

263
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,814
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

264
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,015
THAT'S WHAT I NEED.

265
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,017
GOD, YOU'RE BRILLIANT!

266
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,321
WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT? HOW DO I GET THAT?

267
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:27,126
WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO ONE WAY, REALLY.

268
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,327
IT'S JUST... YOU KNOW

269
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,530
WHATEVER IT TAKES SO THAT YOU CAN FINALLY SAY TO HIM

270
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,132
"I'M OVER YOU."

271
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,134
"I'M OVER YOU."

272
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,136
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

273
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,639
CLOSURE.

274
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,041
OH. HELLO?

275
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,643
EXCUSE ME.

276
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,844
EXCUSE ME, HEL...

277
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:45,645
WHOA?

278
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:46,846
HANG ON.

279
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,047
HELLO, EXCUSE ME, HI.

280
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,248
WHAT?!

281
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,049
HI, I'M SORRY.

282
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,250
I NEED TO BORROW YOUR PHONE

283
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,451
FOR JUST ONE MINUTE.

284
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,053
I'M TALKING.

285
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:55,655
I CAN SEE THAT.

286
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,256
I... JUST ONE PHONE CALL.

287
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,258
I'LL BE VERY QUICK.

288
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,661
I'LL EVEN PAY FOR IT MYSELF.

289
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,463
OKAY, YOU'RE BEING A LITTLE WEIRD ABOUT YOUR PHONE.

290
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,268
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

291
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,270

292
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,872
THANK YOU.

293
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,674

294
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,676
SO GOOD WITH PEOPLE.

295
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,582
MACHINE.

296
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,985
JUST WAITING FOR THE BEEP.

297
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,586
GOOD.

298
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,389
ROSS, HI.

299
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,391
IT'S RACHEL.

300
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:35,194
I'M JUST CALLING TO SAY THAT... UM...

301
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,796
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

302
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,198
AND I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU

303
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,000
AND YOUR CAT.

304
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,601
WHO, BY THE WAY

305
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:46,005
I THINK YOU SHOULD NAME MICHAEL.

306
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,409
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU SEE THERE

307
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,011
I'M THINKING OF NAMES

308
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,814
SO, OBVIOUSLY, I AM OVER YOU.

309
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,816
I... AM OVER...

310
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,017
YOU.

311
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,419
AND THAT, MY FRIEND

312
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:03,622
IS WHAT THEY CALL "CLOSURE."

313
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,637
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO

314
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:19,638
NO, NO!

315
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,742
MONICA, IT'S SUNDAY MORNING.

316
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,343
I'M NOT RUNNING ON A SUNDAY.

317
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,544
WHY NOT?

318
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,347
BECAUSE IT'S SUNDAY!

319
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,349
IT'S GOD'S DAY.

320
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,953
HEY, YOU SAY STOP, AND WE STOP.

321
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,554
OKAY!

322
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:36,355
STOP.

323
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,758
NO! COME ON! WE CAN'T STOP!

324
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,160
COME ON! WE GOT THREE MORE POUNDS TO GO!

325
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,363
I AM THE ENERGY TRAIN, AND YOU ARE ON BOARD.

326
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,965
WOO WOO!

327
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,166
WOO WOO!

328
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,568
WOO WOO!

329
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,076
WOO.

330
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,978

331
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,379
HEY, RACH.

332
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,381

333
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,885
OH. AND HOW WAS THE DATE?

334
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:09,088
UM, I THINK THERE WAS A RESTAURANT.

335
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,090
I KNOW THERE WAS WINE.

336
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,092
WOW, WELL, UH...

337
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,895
UH, ACTUALLY, JULIE'S DOWNSTAIRS GETTING A CAB.

338
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,096
I JUST NEED

339
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,097
THE CAT TOYS.

340
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,698
DID MONICA SAY...?

341
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,301
WHAT, WHY... WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT?

342
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,303
I'M SO... I DON'T KNOW.

343
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,506
I... I FEEL LIKE I HAD A DREAM ABOUT YOU LAST NIGHT.

344
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,508
BUT... I DON'T REMEMBER.

345
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,312
OKAY.

346
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,213
OH, OH, OH.

347
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,414

348
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:38,217
DID WE SPEAK ON THE PHONE LAST NIGHT?

349
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,819
DID YOU CALL ME?

350
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,221
NO. I STAYED AT JULIE'S LAST NIGHT.

351
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,422
HUH.

352
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,825
OH, ACTUALLY, I HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN HOME YET.

353
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,426
DO YOU MIND IF I CHECK MY MESSAGES?

354
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,428
OH, YEAH. GO AHEAD.

355
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,434
RACH, I GOT A MESSAGE FROM YOU.

356
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,440
WHO'S MICHAEL?

357
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,641
OH, MY GOD.

358
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:03,843
OH, MY GOD, ROSS, NO.

359
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,044
HANG UP THE PHONE!

360
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,245
GIVE ME THE PHONE, ROSS!

361
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,446
GIVE ME THE PHONE!

362
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,048
GIVE ME THE PHONE!

363
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,249
GIVE ME THE...!

364
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,156
YOU'RE OVER ME?

365
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:18,757
OH, GOD!

366
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,659
WHA...? YOU'RE, UH...

YOU'RE... YOU'RE OVER ME?

369
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,464

370
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,166
OH, MY GOD.

371
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,567
OH, GOD...

372
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:32,071
WHEN... WHEN WERE YOU...

373
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,874
UNDER ME?

374
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,277
OH, GOD...

375
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,778
RACH?

376
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,380
RACHEL, DO YOU...?

377
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,581
I MEAN, WERE YOU, UH...?

378
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:43,782

379
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:44,984
WHAT?

380
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,585
OKAY. OKAY, OKAY.

381
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:47,786
WELL...

382
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:52,191
BASICALLY, LATELY I'VE, UH...

383
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,593

HOW COME YOU'RE WATCHING A RABBI PLAY ELECTRIC GUITAR?

00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,418
I CAN'T FIND THE REMOTE.

430
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,221
OH. THANK YOU.

00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:16,435
SO... SO HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

439
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:17,936
WELL, I FINALLY TOOK YOUR ADVICE

440
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,538
AND ASKED HIM WHAT WAS GOING ON.

441
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,939
AND WHAT DID HE SAY?

442
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:21,740
HE SAID HE UNDERSTANDS

443
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,543
HOW SEX CAN BE, LIKE, A VERY EMOTIONAL THING FOR A WOMAN

444
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,945
AND HE WAS JUST AFRAID THAT I WAS GOING TO GET

445
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,147
ALL, YOU KNOW, LIKE

446
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,149
"OOH, IS HE GOING TO CALL ME THE NEXT DAY?"

447
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,151
AND, YOU KNOW, "WHERE IS THIS GOING?"

448
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,353
AND, YOU KNOW, BLAH BLAH BLAH... YEAH...

449
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,255
HE SAID HE WANTED TO HOLD OFF

450
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,657
UNTIL HE WAS PREPARED TO BE REALLY SERIOUS.

451
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,459
WOW.

452
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,262
YEAH. SO I SAID, "OKAY, RELAX, PLEASE."

453
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,463
YOU KNOW?

454
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,864
I MEAN

455
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,567
SEX CAN BE JUST ABOUT TWO PEOPLE RIGHT THERE

456
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,169
IN THE MOMENT, YOU KNOW.

457
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,571
IF HE WANTS TO SEE ME AGAIN, HE CAN CALL

458
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,073
AND IF NOT, THAT'S FINE, TOO.

459
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,276
SO AFTER A LOT OF TALKING...

460
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,881
...I CONVINCED HIM.

461
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,985

00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,788
HE GOT YOU TO BEG TO SLEEP WITH HIM.

463
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:13,392
HE GOT YOU TO SAY HE NEVER HAS TO CALL YOU AGAIN

464
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,394
AND...

465
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,297

466
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,900

I DON'T WANT ONE THAT'S ABOUT TO DIE.

484
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,649
OH, SEE, NOW WE SHOULD HAVE WORKED THAT OUT

485
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,850

I CAN'T HAVE TWO CATS! I MEAN...

GOOD NIGHT, GUNTHER.

509
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,912
HI.

510
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:17,115
I DIDN'T GET A CAT.

511
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,518
OH, THAT'S, UM...

512
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,119
INTERESTING.

513
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,121
NO. NO, IT'S NOT INTERESTING, OKAY?

514
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,123
IT'S VERY, VERY NOT INTERESTING.

515
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,725
IT'S ACTUALLY 100% COMPLETELY

516
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,327
THE OPPOSITE OF INTERESTING.

517
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,028
I GOT IT, ROSS.

518
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,530
YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO TELL ME

519
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,731
YOU EVER HAD FEELINGS FOR ME.

520
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,032
WHAT?!

521
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,234
I WAS DOING GREAT WITH JULIE

522
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,835
BEFORE I FOUND OUT ABOUT YOU.

523
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,238
HEY, I WAS DOING GREAT BEFORE I FOUND OUT ABOUT YOU.

524
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,640
YOU THINK IT'S EASY FOR ME TO SEE YOU WITH JULIE?

525
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,642
WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING BEFORE I MET HER!

526
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:44,843
I DIDN'T KNOW THEN!

527
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,646
AND HOW COME YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO ME?

528
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,248
THERE WAS NEVER A GOOD TIME.

529
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,849
RIGHT! BECAUSE YOU ONLY HAD A YEAR

530
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,851
AND WE ONLY HUNG OUT EVERY NIGHT.

531
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,453
NOT... NOT... NOT...

532
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,455
EVERY NIGHT.

533
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,656
YOU KNOW

534
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,658
AND AND IT'S NOT LIKE I DIDN'T TRY, RACHEL

535
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:00,859
BUT THINGS GOT IN THE WAY

536
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,461
YOU KNOW, LIKE LIKE ITALIAN GUYS

537
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,463
OR EX FIANCEES

538
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,664
OR, OR, OR...

539
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:09,668
ITALIAN GUYS.

540
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,070
HEY, THERE WAS ONE ITALIAN GUY, OKAY?

541
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,473
AND DO YOU EVEN HAVE A POINT?

542
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,276
THE POINT IS I... I DON'T NEED THIS RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

543
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,278
IT'S IT'S TOO LATE. I'M WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

544
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,479
I'M HAPPY. THIS SHIP HAS SAILED.

545
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,280
OKAY, SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

546
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,481
YOU CAN JUST

547
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,682
SORT OF PUT AWAY FEELINGS

548
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,684
OR WHATEVER THE HELL IT WAS THAT YOU FELT FOR ME?

549
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,286
HEY, I'VE BEEN DOING IT SINCE THE NINTH GRADE.

550
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:28,887
I'VE GOTTEN PRETTY DAMN GOOD AT IT.

551
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,088
ALL RIGHT, FINE, YOU GO AHEAD

552
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,490
AND YOU DO THAT, ALL RIGHT, ROSS? FINE, FINE.

553
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,891
BECAUSE I DON'T NEED YOUR STUPID SHIP!

554
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,092
GOOD.

555
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,394
GOOD.

556
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,595
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

557
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:37,796
NOW I GOT CLOSURE!

558
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,402
OH!

559
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,804

560
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,210

561
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,242

562
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,851
TRY THE BOTTOM ONE.

563
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:03,482
MONICA, IT'S 6:30 IN THE MORNING.

564
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,083
WE'RE NOT WORKING OUT.

565
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,685
IT'S OVER.

566
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,087
NO WAY! WITH ONE POUND TO GO? COME ON!

567
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:09,888
? WE'RE WORKING ?

568
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,089
? WE'RE MOVING ?

569
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,492
? WE'RE IN THE ZONE, WE'RE GROOVING. ?

570
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,695
OKAY, I DON'T... I DON'T MIND THE LAST POUND, OKAY?

571
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,498
IN FACT, I KIND OF LIKE THE LAST POUND.

572
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:23,602
OKAY? SO DON'T MAKE ME DO ANYTHING THAT I'LL REGRET.

573
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:27,606
OH! WHAT YOU GOING TO DO, FAT BOY? HUH?

574
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,207
WHAT?

575
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,012
NOTHING. EXCEPT TELL YOU, UH, I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL

576
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,213
HOW MUCH ENERGY YOU HAVE.

577
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,415
WELL! THANKS.

578
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,616
I MEAN

579
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:38,817
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING

580
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:41,219
HOW TOUGH IT'S BEEN FOR YOU TO FIND WORK.

581
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,121
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU...

582
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:45,123
YOU KNOW, I MEAN

583
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,526
YOU CAN'T TELL YOUR PARENTS YOU WERE FIRED

584
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,127
BECAUSE THEY'D BE DISAPPOINTED.

585
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:52,731
UH HUH.

586
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,332
AND IT'S NOT AS IF YOU HAVE

587
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,735
A BOYFRIEND'S SHOULDER TO CRY ON.

588
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,737
WELL, NO, BUT, I...

589
00:23:58,737 --> 00:23:59,938
I MEAN, IF IT WERE ME

590
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:01,940
I THINK I'D HAVE DIFFICULTY

591
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,342
JUST GETTING OUT OF BED AT ALL.

592
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:13,151
YOU KNOW, I TRY TO STAY POSITIVE.

593
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,153
SO, YOU...

594
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,956
YOU FEEL LIKE GOING FOR A RUN?

595
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,360
ALL RIGHT.

596
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,963
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

597
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:28,166
IF YOU WANT, YOU COULD JUST TAKE A NAP RIGHT HERE.

598
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,969
OKAY.

599
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,971
JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

600
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,573
OKAY.
