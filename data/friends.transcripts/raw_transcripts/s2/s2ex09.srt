1
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:04,404
 OOH, OOH, OOH, OOH!

2
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:08,408
UGLY NAKED GUY IS DECORATING HIS TREE.

3
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:11,911
AND OH, MY GOD, YOU SHOULD SEE THE SIZE

4
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:13,913
OF HIS CHRISTMAS BALLS.

5
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:15,115
HEY. HEY.

6
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,917
HOW MUCH DID YOU GUYS TIP THE SUPER THIS YEAR?

7
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,519
WE WERE GOING TO GIVE $50 DOLLAR.

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,520
BUT IF YOU GUYS GAVE MORE

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,721
WE DON'T WANT TO LOOK BAD.

10
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:24,024
ACTUALLY, THIS YEAR, WE JUST MADE HIM

11
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,025
HOMEMADE COOKIES.

12
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,226
AND $25 DOLLAR IT IS.

13
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,429
YOU GAVE HIM COOKIES?

14
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,231
MONEY IS SO IMPERSONAL.

15
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,233
COOKIES SAYS SOMEONE REALLY CARES.

16
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:36,236
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE BROKE.

17
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,437
BUT COOKIES DO SAY THAT.

18
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:38,938
I CAN SEE THAT.

19
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:42,042
A PLATE OF BROWNIES ONCE TOLD ME A LIMERICK.

20
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,845
PHEEBS, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

21
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,648
WERE THESE, UH, "FUNNY" BROWNIES?

22
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,650
NOT ESPECIALLY.

23
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,853
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK THEY HAD POT IN THEM.

24
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,359
SO, YOU GUYS, WHO ELSE DID YOU TIP WITH COOKIES?

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,960
UH, THE MAILMAN...

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,562
THE SUPER...

27
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,164

28
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,566
 OH, AND THE NEWSPAPER DELIVERY GUY.

29
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,168
OH, MY GOD.

30
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,369
 WHAT?

31
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,771
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THIS.

32
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,273
 OH, WOW!

33
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,275
OOH! GOSH!

34
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,878
OH, THERE'S A COOKIE SMASHED IN THE SPORTS SECTION.

35
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,281
OH, LOOK! AND HE DID MY CROSSWORD PUZZLE.

36
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,283
YEAH, BUT NOT VERY WELL.

37
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,486
UNLESS "FOURTEEN ACROSS: GERSHWIN MUSICAL" ACTUALLY IS

38
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,289
"BITE ME, BITE ME, BITE ME, BITE ME."

52
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,039
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S CHRISTMAS ALREADY, YOU KNOW?

53
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,741
I MEAN, ONE DAY YOU'RE EATING TURKEY.

54
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:24,544
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOUR LORDS ARE A LEAPING

55
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,146
AND YOUR GEESE ARE A LAYING.

56
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,048
WHICH IS WHY GEESE ARE SO RELAXED

57
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,650
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

58
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,253
HEY, GUYS.

59
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,454
 HEY.

60
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,857
HEY, RACH.

61
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:40,660
I, UH, GOT YOU A LITTLE PRESENT.

62
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,264
I'LL OPEN IT.

63
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,066
IT'S A SLINKY.

64
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,469
REMEMBER?

65
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,670
? WHAT WALKS DOWNSTAIRS ?

66
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,672
? ALONE OR IN PAIRS ?

67
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,274
? EVERYONE KNOWS IT'S... ?

68
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,676
? JUST A BIG SPRING. ?

69
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,678
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE STILL MAD AT ME

70
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,680
BECAUSE OF THE WHOLE...

71
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,082
HORRIBLE AND DEGRADING LIST OF REASONS NOT TO BE WITH ME?

72
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,084
HOW ABOUT FROM NOW ON WE JUST CALL IT

73
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,686
THE "UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT"?

74
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,290
HEY, GUNTHER.

75
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,292
YOU GOT STAIRS IN YOUR PLACE?

76
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,092
YEAH.

77
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,294
GO NUTS.

78
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,497
HEY, GUYS.

79
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,499
 HEY.

80
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,000
WHAT'S IN THE BAG?

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,403
MMM, JUST SOME PRESENTS.

00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,604
COME ON, SHOW US WHAT YOU BOUGHT.

83
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,407
YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.

84
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,210
OKAY.

85
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,214
OKAY, THIS IS A PICTURE FRAME

86
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,216
FROM BEN TO MY PARENTS.

87
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,017
AW, THAT'S CUTE.

88
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:41,020
I GOT SOME "HERS AND HERS" TOWELS FOR SUSAN AND CAROL.

89
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,225
AND, UH...

90
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,627
I GOT THIS BLOUSE FOR MOM.

91
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,128
ROSS, THAT IS GORGEOUS.

92
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,732
LOOK AT THESE AUTHENTIC FAKE MEDALS.

93
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,734
MOM'S GOING TO BE VOTED BEST DRESSED

94
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,136
AT THE MAKE BELIEVE MILITARY ACADEMY.

95
00:03:58,838 --> 00:03:59,739
HEY.

96
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,341
HEY, PHEEBS.

97
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,942
HAPPY CHRISTMAS EVE EVE.

98
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,143
YOU, TOO.

99
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:05,345
OH, MY GOD.

100
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,946
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

101
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,548
UH, MACY'S, THIRD FLOOR.

102
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,149
HOME FURNISHINGS.

103
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,751
THIS IS MY FATHER.

104
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,554
THIS IS A PICTURE OF MY DAD.

105
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,158
PHEEBS, THAT'S THE GUY THAT COMES IN THE FRAME.

106
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,561
NO, IT ISN'T. THIS IS MY DAD. ALL RIGHT, I'LL SHOW YOU.

107
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,963
PHOEBE, I THOUGHT YOUR DAD WAS IN PRISON.

108
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,565
NO, NO. THAT'S MY STEPDAD.

109
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,967
MY REAL DAD'S THE ONE THAT RAN OUT ON US

110
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,569
BEFORE I WAS BORN.

111
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,571
HOW HAVE YOU NEVER BEEN ON OPRAH?

112
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,174
OKAY, LOOK, SEE? THIS IS HIM.

113
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,977
MY MOTHER GAVE ME THIS PICTURE BEFORE SHE DIED.

114
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,178
SAME GUY.

115
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,284
HONEY, UH, THIS IS A PICTURE OF THE FRAME GUY

116
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,686
POSING IN FRONT OF A BRIGHT BLUE SCREEN

117
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:47,887
WITH A COLLIE.

118
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,889
THAT'S NOT A BLUE SCREEN.

119
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,491
IT'S JUST...

120
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,294
MAYBE IT WAS JUST REALLY CLEAR THAT DAY.

121
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,197
OKAY. I HAVE TO TALK TO MY GRANDMOTHER.

122
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:00,199
 BUT WAIT A MINUTE, HONEY...

123
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,002
 PHEEBS... PHEEBS...

124
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,504
WHOA.

125
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,705
WOW.

126
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,408
SO, ANYWAY, I'M TRYING TO GET MY BOSS'S EX WIFE

127
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,609
TO SLEEP WITH ME.

128
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,011
 JOEY!

129
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,415
OH, BUT WHEN PHOEBE HAS A PROBLEM, EVERYONE'S ALL EARS.

130
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,420
"ES THER LIVINGSTON..."

131
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,623
GONE!

132
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,625
AND...

133
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,226
HI, POOH.

134
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,428
HI, GRAM.

135
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,629
WHAT YOU DOING?

136
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,432
OH, JUST UPDATING THE PHONE BOOK.

137
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:35,234
UM, GRAM?

138
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:38,438
UM, CAN I SEE THE PICTURES OF MY DAD AGAIN?

139
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,039
OH.

140
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,641
OH, SURE, SURE.

141
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:42,842
UH...

142
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,444
HOW COME?

143
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,946
JUST, YOU KNOW, TO... SEE THEM.

144
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,548
OH, SURE. YEAH.

145
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,950
ALL RIGHT, WELL...

146
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,753
THIS IS THE ONE OF YOUR FATHER IN A MEADOW.

147
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:58,558
AND, UH, HELPING A LITTLE BOY FLY A KITE.

148
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,361
AND HERE HE IS AT A GRADUATION.

149
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,365
ANOTHER GRADUATION.

150
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,570
ANOTHER GRADUATION.

151
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,871
OKAY.

152
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,673
IS THIS REALLY MY FATHER?

153
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,675
IS IT REALLY YOUR F...

154
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,276
I CA...

155
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,278
WELL, OF COURSE IT IS.

156
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,480
I SMELL SMOKE.

157
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,282
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE SOMEONE'S PANTS ARE ON FIRE.

158
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:24,884
WELL, I...

159
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,486
YOU KNOW, IN ALL THE YEARS

160
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,189
THAT WE HAVE BEEN GRANDMOTHER AND GRANDDAUGHTER

161
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,691
YOU HAVE NEVER LIED TO ME.

162
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,693
ALL RIGHT, THAT IS NOT YOUR FATHER.

163
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,095
THAT'S JUST A PICTURE OF A GUY IN A FRAME.

164
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,399
OH, GOD...

165
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,001
IT WAS YOUR MOTHER'S IDEA.

166
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,404
SHE DIDN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW YOUR REAL FATHER

167
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,206
BECAUSE IT HURT HER SO MUCH WHEN HE LEFT.

168
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,208
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GO ALONG WITH IT...

169
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,410
BUT, WELL, THEN SHE DIED

170
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,812
AND IT WAS HARDER TO ARGUE WITH HER.

171
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,917
NOT IMPOSSIBLE, BUT HARDER.

172
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,118
ALL RIGHT, SO...

173
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,521
WELL, HE'S NOT A FAMOUS TREE SURGEON?

174
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,525
AND THEN I GUESS, OKAY

175
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,327
HE DOESN'T LIVE IN A HUT IN BURMA

176
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,329
WHERE THERE'S NO PHONES?

177
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,732
LAST I HEARD, HE WAS A PHARMACIST

178
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,333
SOMEWHERE UPSTATE.

179
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,335
OKAY. THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

180
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:19,138
WHY WOULD THE VILLAGERS WORSHIP A PHARMACIST?

181
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,142
HONEY...

182
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,343
OH.

183
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,945
YEAH.

184
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,848
ANYWAY, THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

185
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,852
THAT...

186
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,055
AND THIS.

187
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,760
THIS...

188
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,463
IS THE REAL HIM.

189
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,265
OH.

190
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,869
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER MY FATHER

191
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,871
ALL DRESSED UP IN THE RED SUIT

192
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,674
WITH THE BIG BLACK BOOTS AND THE PATENT LEATHER BELT...

193
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,275
SNEAKING AROUND DOWNSTAIRS.

194
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,277
HE DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY TO SEE HIM.

195
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,479
BUT HE'D BE DRUNK

196
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,881
SO HE'D STUMBLE, CRASH INTO SOMETHING

197
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,483
AND WAKE EVERYBODY UP.

198
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,686
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS.

199
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,088
WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT CHRISTMAS?

200
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,091
HI.

201
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,794
HEY. ANYONE HEAR FROM PHOEBE YET?

202
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:15,995
NO, NOTHING.

203
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,597
I HOPE SHE'S OKAY.

204
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,999
YEAH. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S GOING THROUGH.

205
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,401
HOW DO YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S GOING THROUGH?

206
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,003
SHE TOLD US.

207
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,208
SO WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE, MONICA?

208
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,810
JUST SOME STUFF FOR THE PARTY.

209
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,811
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

210
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,813
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE CHRISTMAS SHOPPING?

211
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,815
YOU GUYS HAVEN'T GOTTEN YOUR PRESENTS YET?

212
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,016
TOMORROW IS CHRISTMAS EVE.

213
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:37,817
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

214
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,219
DON'T YOU HAVE TO BE CLAYMATION

215
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,821
TO SAY STUFF LIKE THAT?

216
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:44,924
BY THE WAY, MON

217
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,926
I DON'T THINK THE MAILMAN LIKED YOUR COOKIES.

218
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,528
HERE ARE THE ORNAMENTS YOUR MOM SENT.

219
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,930

220
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,032
WELL...

221
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,834
MAYBE THE MAILMAN LIKED THE COOKIES.

222
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,236
WE JUST DIDN'T GIVE HIM ENOUGH.

223
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:00,339
MONICA, PIGEONS LEARN FASTER THAN YOU.

224
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,541

225
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,949
HEY, RACH... YOU KNOW WHAT?

226
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,752
I THINK I KNOW WHAT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

227
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,955
HOW ABOUT YOU MAKE A LIST ABOUT ME?

228
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,156
FORGET IT, ROSS.

229
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,357
I'M NOT GOING TO STAND HERE

230
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,559
AND MAKE A LIST OF...

231
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,961
OKAY. YOU'RE WHINY.

232
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,563
YOU ARE... OBSESSIVE.

233
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,164
YOU ARE INSECURE.

234
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,766
YOU'RE GUTLESS.

235
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,768
YOU DON'T JUST SORT OF SEIZE THE DAY.

236
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,369
YOU LIKED ME FOR, WHAT, A YEAR

237
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,371
AND YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

238
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,575
AND, UH... OH, YOU WEAR TOO MUCH OF THAT GEL IN YOUR HAIR.

239
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,381
SEE? THERE... YOU, UH...

240
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,184
ALL RIGHT. YOU DID WHAT I SAID.

241
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,485
YEAH, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

242
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,087
YOU'RE RIGHT. I DO FEEL BETTER.

243
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:49,689
THANK YOU, ROSS.

244
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,495
YEAH. IN ALBANY.

245
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,699
COULD I HAVE THE NUMBER OF FRANK BUFFAY?

246
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,904
OKAY. UM, IN ITHACA?

247
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,707
ALL RIGHT, UM, SARATOGA?

248
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,308
ONEONTA?

249
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,910
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

250
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,113
YOU SHOULDN'T CALL YOURSELF "INFORMATION."

251
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,219
HEY.

252
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,621
HELLO, GRANDMA.

253
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,423
IF THAT IS, IN FACT, YOUR REAL NAME.

254
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,625
COME ON NOW, POOH.

255
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,828
DON'T STILL BE MAD AT ME.

256
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,830
HOW'S IT GOING?

257
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,031
OH, NOT SO GOOD.

258
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,033
UPSTATE'S PRETTY BIG.

259
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,234
HE'S PRETTY SMALL.

260
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,435
YOU DO THE MATH.

261
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:40,439
WELL, I THINK YOU'RE BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM.

262
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,242
OH, HONEY, I KNOW HE'S YOUR DADDY

263
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:47,246
BUT, TO ME, HE'S STILL THE IRRESPONSIBLE CREEP

264
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:51,651
WHO KNOCKED UP YOUR MOM AND STOLE HER GREMLIN.

265
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,352
I KNOW, I JUST...

266
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:56,155
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHO HE WAS, YOU KNOW?

267
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,758
YEAH. I KNOW.

268
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,961
OKAY.

269
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,363
I WASN'T COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU

270
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,365
WHEN I TOLD YOU THAT, UH...

271
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,668
I DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE HE LIVED.

272
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,869
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

273
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:14,974
HE LIVES AT 74 LAUREL DRIVE IN MIDDLETOWN.

274
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,879
IF YOU HIT THE DAIRY QUEEN, YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR.

275
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,881
YOU CAN TAKE MY CAB.

276
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,482
WOW!

277
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,484
THANK YOU.

278
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,688
NOW, REMEMBER, NOBODY ELSE DRIVES THAT CAB.

279
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,889
UH HUH. GOT IT.

280
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,191
OH! I'M GOING TO SEE MY DAD.

281
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,593
OH, THANK YOU.

282
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,996
OH... OH...

283
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,197
OKAY.

284
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,599
WISH ME LUCK, GRANDPA.

285
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,111
HEY. PHOEBE HERE WITH THE CAB YET?

286
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,914
YEAH. SHE BROUGHT THE INVISIBLE CAB.

287
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,615
HOP IN.

288
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,217
WELL, SHE BETTER GET HERE SOON.

289
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,219
THE OUTLET STORES CLOSE AT 7:00.

290
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,022
DON'T WORRY. I FIGURE IT WILL BE TWO HOURS TO PHOEBE'S DAD'S HOUSE.

291
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,424
THEY'LL MEET, THEY'LL CHAT, THEY'LL SWAP LIFE STORIES.

292
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,726
EVEN IF PHOEBE TELLS THE ONE

293
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,327
WHERE SHE'S AN EGYPTIAN SLAVE GIRL

294
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,929
WE'LL STILL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME.

295
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,230

296
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,431
HEY, HERE SHE COMES.

297
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,632
HEY.

298
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:14,834
HEY!

299
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,636
HI.

300
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,739
HEY!

301
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,340
HEY.

302
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,942
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

303
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:26,345
IN, LIKE, TWO HOURS, I'M GOING TO HAVE A DAD. EESHK!

304
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,246
EESHK.

305
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,447
YEAH, BIG STUFF.

306
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:29,648
OKAY, LET'S GO.

307
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:30,850
OKAY.

308
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,451
ALL RIGHT, HERE. YOU HAVE TO HOLD THIS.

309
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,254
OKAY.

310
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,057
"BRAKE: LEFT, GAS: RIGHT"?

311
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,259
UH HUH. YEAH. THAT'S MY CHEAT SHEET.

312
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:44,764
WHERE'S MY SEAT BELT?

313
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,766
OH, NO, THAT SIDE DOESN'T HAVE ONE.

314
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,668
THE PARAMEDICS HAD TO CUT THROUGH IT.

315
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,073
HEY!

316
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:54,874
HEY.

317
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,182
COME ON, JUST TELL ME, PLEASE.

318
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:04,383
PLEASE.

319
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,985
FOR THE 16th TIME

320
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,788
NO, I DO NOT THINK YOU'RE OBSESSIVE.

321
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,389
OH, GOSH, IT'S HOT IN HERE.

322
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,590
RACH, GET THE HEAT.

323
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,393
ROSS, COULD YOU TURN THE HEAT DOWN, PLEASE?

324
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,796
SURE. AND BY THE WAY, THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

325
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,397
BETWEEN BEING OBSESSIVE...

326
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,598
ROSS, THE HEAT.

327
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,600
FINE. OKAY.

328
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,802
HEAT, HEAT, HEAT.

329
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,804
AND I'M THE OBSESSIVE ONE.

330
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:32,011
OKAY, THIS WAY IS ON, SO THIS IS...

331
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,814
OFF.

332
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,816
DID YOU JUST BREAK THE RADIATOR?

333
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,017
NO.

334
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,820
NO, I WAS TURNING THE KNOB AND, AND...

335
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,222
HERE IT IS.

336
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,123
WELL, PUT IT BACK.

337
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,527
IT, UH...

338
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:49,728
IT WON'T GO BACK.

339
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,730
OH... I'LL CALL THE SUPER.

340
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,432
HERE. LET ME TRY.

341
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,633
OH. OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

342
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,837
I FORGOT ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO FUSE METAL.

343
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,040
HEY, IT'S FUNNY'S COUSIN, NOT FUNNY.

344
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,641
HI, MR. TREEGER.

345
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,643
HI. IT'S RACHEL GREEN FROM UPSTAIRS.

346
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:08,647
YES, SOMEBODY BROKE OUR KNOB ON THE RADIATOR

347
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,050
AND IT'S REALLY HOT IN HERE.

348
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,253
YES, IT'S HOT ENOUGH TO BAKE COOKIES.

349
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,458
WELL, DO YOU THINK WE COULD HAVE A NEW ONE BY 6:00?

350
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,659
WHAT? NO, NO. TUESDAY?

351
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,261
WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL TUESDAY.

352
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,663
WE'RE HAVING A PARTY TONIGHT.

353
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:25,865
OKAY, TIP THE MAN.

354
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,267
NO. IF HE DOESN'T LIKE OUR COOKIES, TOO BAD.

355
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,869
I AM NOT GOING TO BE BLACKMAILED.

356
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,671
LOOK, IF WORSE COMES TO WORSE, IT GETS A LITTLE WARM

357
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,273
WE'LL CALL IT A THEME PARTY.

358
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,474
HEY, HERE'S A THEME--

359
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,476
COME ON IN, LIVE LIKE BACON.

360
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,680
 OOH, THIS IS IT.

361
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,383
74.

362
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,586
OH, SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS FOR.

363
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,188
WOW.

364
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:49,989
THIS IS IT.

365
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,590
I'M GOING TO MEET MY DAD.

366
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,393
THIS IS, LIKE, THE BIGGEST THING EVER, HUH?

367
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,594
YEAH. SURE IS.

368
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:56,795
OKAY.

369
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,797
HERE I GO. I'M GOING IN.

370
00:14:58,797 --> 00:14:59,598
ALL RIGHT.

371
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:00,799
GOOD LUCK, PHEEBS.

372
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,801
OKAY.

373
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,403
HERE I GO.

374
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,208
HERE I GO.

375
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,411
I'M GOING.

376
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:27,626
HI. WELCOME TO OUR TROPICAL CHRISTMAS PARTY.

377
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,228
YOU CAN PUT YOUR COATS AND SWEATERS

378
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,430
AND PANTS AND SHIRTS IN THE BEDROOM.

379
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,834
IT'S HARD TO TELL BECAUSE I'M SWEATING

380
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:39,438
BUT I USE EXACTLY WHAT THE GEL BOTTLE SAYS.

381
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,542
AN AMOUNT ABOUT THE SIZE OF A PEA.

382
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,345
HOW CAN THAT BE TOO MUCH?

383
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,449
 ICE?

384
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,351
ICE? ICE SQUARES, ANYONE?

385
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,953
TAKE A NAPKIN.

386
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,554
ALL RIGHT.

387
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,655
MONICA.

00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:57,456
MONICA.

389
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,058
MONICA, YOUR GUESTS

391
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,261
REALLY?

392
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,263
I'M PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE.

393
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,265
HEY, HEY, HEY, GET IN LINE, BUDDY.

394
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,466

00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,572
MR. TREEGER.

396
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,174

00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:15,975
OH, YEAH.

00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,777
WELL, HEY, WELCOME TO OUR SAUNA.

399
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:19,979
IS IT HOT?

400
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,580
MY BODY ALWAYS STAYS COOL.

401
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,983
PROBABLY BECAUSE I HAVE SO MUCH SKIN.

402
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,586
HEY, CHEESE.

403
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,687
ALL RIGHT.

404
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,289
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE CHANCE.

405
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,490
MONICA, GIVE HIM CASH.

406
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,092
RACHEL, GIVE HIM YOUR EARRINGS.

407
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,094

408
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:35,894
NO.

409
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,096
I WILL NOT CAVE.

00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:37,896
YEAH, I'M WITH MON.

411
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,098
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

412
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,500
YOU KNOW HOW YOU SAY I NEVER SEIZE THE DAY?

413
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,504
EVEN THOUGH HE'S YOUR SUPER, I'M SEIZING.

414
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,108
MR. TREEGER?

415
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:49,908

422
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,522
OH, HEY.

423
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,725
DO YOU THINK THERE'S A CHANCE YOU CAN FIX THAT RADIATOR NOW?

424
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,327
NO CAN DO. LIKE I TOLD THE GIRL

425
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:11,430
I CAN'T GET A NEW KNOB UNTIL TUESDAY.

426

427
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,432

THE PLACE IS NOT OPEN TILL TUESDAY.

439
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,860

00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,063
SO, WAIT...

00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,469
IT REALLY SHOWED YOU CARED.

445
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,477

AND...

489
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,785
I DON'T THINK I'M READY TO LOSE A REAL ONE.

BECAUSE, I MEAN, I KNOW HE'S THERE

518
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,762
SO THAT'S ENOUGH FOR NOW.

519
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,364
HEY, GUYS, IT'S AFTER MIDNIGHT.
