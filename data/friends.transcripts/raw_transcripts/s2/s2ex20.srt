00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,107
HEY.

00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:08,108
WHAT YOU GUYS DOING?

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,510
MONICA'S MAKING US WATCHOLD YELLER.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,213
SO WHY ARE YOU GUYS SO UPSET?

5
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:14,814
IT'S OLD YELLER.

6
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:16,416
IT'S A HAPPY MOVIE.

7
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:17,417
WHAT?

8
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,019
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,220
COME ON.

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,421
HAPPY FAMILY GETS A DOG.

11
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,023
FRONTIER FUN.

12
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,826
YEAH, BUT, PHEEBS, WHAT ABOUT THE END?

13
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:29,229
WHEN YELLER SAVES THE FAMILY FROM THE WOLF

14
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,430
AND EVERYONE'S HAPPY?

15
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,631
THAT'S NOT THE END.

16
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,233
YUH HUH. THAT'S WHEN MY MOTHER

17
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,635
WOULD SHUT OFF THE TV AND SAY "THE END."

18
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,339
WHAT ABOUT THE PART WHERE HE HAS RABIES?

19
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,941
HE DOESN'T HAVE RABIES. HE HAS BABIES.

20
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,545
THAT'S WHAT MY MOM SAID.

21
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,547
UH, PHOEBE, I DON'T THINK YOUR MOM

22
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,350
WOULD WANT YOU TO SEE WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

23
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,152
WHY? WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN?

24
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,954
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS PART BEFORE.

25
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:57,957
HEY, TRAVIS, WHATCHA DOING WITH THAT GUN?

26
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,062
OH, NO.

27
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,464
NO, NO, TRAVIS, PUT DOWN THE GUN.

28
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,066
NO, NO, NO, HE'S YOUR BUDDY.

29
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,267
HE'S YOUR YELLER. NO.

30
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,868
NO, NO. THE END! THE END!

31
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:11,671

32
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:15,675
OKAY, WHAT KIND OF A SICK DOGGIE SNUFF FILM IS THIS?!

46
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,825
HEY, HAVE YOU GUYS EATEN?

47
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,427
BECAUSE RICHARD AND I JUST FINISHED

48
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,429
AND WE'VE GOT LEFTOVERS.

49
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,030
CHICKEN AND POTATOES.

50
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,034
WHAT AM I WEARING?

51
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,437
ACTUALLY, NOTHING BUT RUBBER GLOVES.

52
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,842
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THESE TIMES

53
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,744
YOU'RE GOING TO REALLY BE NAKED

54
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,746
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO COME OVER.

55
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,549
OOH, THAT WOULD TEACH ME A LESSON.

56
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:30,750
YEAH.

57
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,352
ALL RIGHT, I'VE GOT A LEG

58
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,553
THREE BREASTS AND A WING.

59
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,655
HOW DO YOU FIND CLOTHES THAT FIT?

60
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,359
OH, HEY, MONICA, WE GOT A QUESTION.

61
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,960
ALL RIGHT, FOR THE ZILLIONTH TIME

62
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,763
YES, I SEE OTHER WOMEN IN THE SHOWER AT THE GYM

63
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,365
AND, NO, I DON'T LOOK.

64
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,966
NO, NOT THAT ONE.

65
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,168
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

66
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,170
WHO TO BRING TO THE KNICKS GAME TONIGHT.

67
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,371
WE HAVE AN EXTRA TICKET.

68
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,972
YEAH, ROSS CAN'T GO.

69
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,574
SO IT'S BETWEEN MY FRIEND ERIC PROWER

70
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:55,775
WHO HAS BREATH ISSUES

71
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,477
AND DAN, WITH THE POKING.

72
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,078
"DID YOU SEE THAT PLAY?"

73
00:02:59,078 --> 00:02:59,879
"DO YOU WANT

74
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,080
SOME MORE BEER?"

75
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,282
"IS THAT SPIKE LEE?"

76
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,483
OKAY.

77
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,986
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU ASK RICHARD?

78
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,389
OKAY. HEY, RICHARD.

79
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,791
IF YOU HAD AN EXTRA TICKET

80
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,793
TO THE KNICKS GAME...

81
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,196
AND YOU HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A FRIEND

82
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,598
WHO SMELLED AND ONE WHO...

83
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,200
BRUISES YOU

84
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,401
WHO WOULD YOU PICK?

85
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,002
WOW.

86
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,004
WELL, BEING A HUGE KNICKS FAN MYSELF

87
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,606
I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE SOMEONE

88
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,409
WHO'S A HUGE KNICKS FAN.

89
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,110
OKAY.

90
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,112
THAT'S ERIC.

91
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,914
GLAD TO BE OF HELP.

92
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,516
MATCHES.

93
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,618
I MEANT

94
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,620
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE RICHARD TO THE GAME?

95
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,821

96
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,823
WHAT?

97
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,425
I DON'T KNOW...

98
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,626
COME ON.

99
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,628
HE KEEPS HIS FINGERS TO HIMSELF

100
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,030
AND HE'S ALWAYS MINTY FRESH.

101
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,932
RICHARD'S REALLY NICE AND EVERYTHING.

102
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,534
IT'S JUST WE DON'T KNOW HIM REALLY WELL

103
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,536
YOU KNOW, AND PLUS, HE'S, YOU KNOW, OLD...

104
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,541
ERTHAN SOME PEOPLE

105
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,744
BUT, UH, YOUNGER THAN SOME BUILDINGS.

106
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,846
SO HE'S A LITTLE OLDER.

107
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,448
BIG DEAL.

108
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,850
I MEAN, HE'S IMPORTANT TO ME.

109
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,053
YOU KNOW, IF YOU ASK HIM, HE MIGHT TAKE YOU IN HIS JAG.

110
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,259
HOW DO WE SAY "YES" NOW

111
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,661
AND MAKE IT SEEM LIKE WE'RE NOT DOING IT

112
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,063
JUST TO RIDE IN THE COOL CAR?

113
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,065
OKAY, THIS COULD BE TOUGH.

114
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,067
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

115
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,770
MONICA, WE'LL BRING HIM

116
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,973
BUT ONLY IF HE TAKES THE JAGUAR.

117
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,777
OOH, YOU ALMOST HAD IT.

118
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:43,883

119
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,084
NO, NO. YOU'RE FINE.

120
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,286
YOU'RE FINE.

121
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,487
HELLO.

122
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,288
HI.

123
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,290
HI, HONEY.

124
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,692
YOU GUYS ARE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED.

125
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:53,893
WHAT? WHAT?

126
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,094
WE WERE SITTING OVER THERE

127
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,696
PLAYING ON THE FLOOR

128
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,698
AND HE GRABS THE TABLE AND HE PULLS HIMSELF UP.

129
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,302
HE PULLED HIMSELF UP.

130
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,903
STANDING MAN.

131
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,805
I'M SORRY YOU GUYS MISSED IT

132
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,606
BUT I DID TAPE IT

133
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,608
SO IF YOU GUYS WANT TO SEE IT...

134
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:09,909
UH, WE KNOW.

135
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,511
HE ALREADY DID IT LAST WEEK.

136
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,314
YOU CAN WATCH OUR TAPE IF YOU WANT.

137
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,115
SEE? I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

138
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,918
I MISSED... I MISSED THE FIRST TIME OF EVERYTHING.

139
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,321
I MISSED THE FIRST TIME HE ROLLED OVER

140
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,522
THE FIRST TIME HE CRAWLED.

141
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,723
WHAT ELSE DID I MISS?

142
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,725
HAS HE SPOKEN YET? IS HE DRIVING?

143
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,727
DOES HE HAVE A FAVORITE LIQUEUR?

144
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:28,528
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY

145
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,930
HE'S GETTING CLOSER ON THE TALKING THING.

146
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,532
HE CAN'T QUITE SAY "MAMA" YET

147
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,733
BUT ONCE HE SAID "YEMEN."

148
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,934
SEE?

149
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,135
I DON'T KNOW.

150
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,337
I'M SO SICK OF MISSING STUFF.

151
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,339
I WANT HIM FOR MORE THAN A DAY.

152
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,940
I WANT HIM FOR A WHOLE WEEKEND.

153
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,141
NO, LISTEN...

154
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,544
THAT'LL BE FINE. THAT WILL BE GREAT.

155
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,647
REALLY?

156
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,049
I MEAN, I HAD A WHOLE SPEECH PREPARED.

157
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,452
OH, SHOOT. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FUN.

158
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,455

159
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,056
OH, LOOK, DID... DID YOU JUST SEE THAT?

160
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,459
DID YOU SEE? HE JUST WAVED. HE JUST WAVED!

161
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,660
HE'S NEVER WAVED BEFORE!

162
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,261
YOU'VE NEVER WAVED BEFORE!

163
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,463
YES, HE HAS.

164
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,064
VERY GOOD.

165
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,267
HEY.

166
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,068
HEY, PHEEBS.

167
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,269
WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

168
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,672
OKAY. LOVE STORY, BRIAN'S SONG

169
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,273
AND TERMS OF ENDEARMENT.

170
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,676
WOW. ALL YOU NEED NOW IS THE KILLING FIELDS

171
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:17,877
AND SOME GUACAMOLE

172
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,479
AND YOU GOT YOURSELF A PAR TAY.

173
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,483
YEAH. I TALKED TO MY GRANDMA ABOUT THE OLD YELLER INCIDENT

174
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,285
AND SHE TOLD ME THAT MY MOM USED TO NOT SHOW US

175
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:30,690
THE ENDS OF SAD MOVIES TO SHIELD US FROM THE PAIN AND SADNESS

176
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,493
YOU KNOW, BEFORE SHE KILLED HERSELF.

177
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:35,995
HEY.

178
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:36,796
HEY.

179
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,398
WHERE IS HE? WHERE'S RICHARD?

180
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:39,599
DID YOU DITCH HIM?

181
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,601
YEAH, RIGHT AFTER WE STOLE HIS LUNCH MONEY

182
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,802
AND GAVE HIM A WEDGIE.

183
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,905
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

184
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,706
HE'S PARKING THE CAR.

185
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,307
DID YOU GUYS HAVE FUN?

186
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,309
YOUR BOYFRIEND IS SO COOL.

187
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,511
REALLY?

188
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,513
YEAH, HE LET US DRIVE HIS JAGUAR.

189
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,915
JOEY FOR 12 BLOCKS, ME FOR 15.

190
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,517
 WOW.

191
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,918
HE MUST LIKE YOU THE BEST.

192
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,620
OH, AND WHAT ABOUT THAT THING HE DID

193
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,022
WHEN HE TIPPED THE GUY WHO SHOWED US TO OUR SEATS?

194
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:04,524
YOU NEVER EVEN SAW THE MONEY.

195
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:05,725
IT WAS LIKE THIS.

196
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:06,926
"HEY, CHANDLER

197
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,928
THANKS FOR SHOWING US TO OUR SEATS."

198
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,129
"YOU'RE WELCOME.

199
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,532
HEY, JOEY, THANKS FOR PARKING THE CAR."

200
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,133
"NO PROBLEM.

201
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,334
HEY, CHANDLER..."

202
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,536
I THINK THEY GET IT.

203
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,737
OKAY.

204
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,441
THERE'S THE MAN!

205
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,042
HEY!

206
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,445
HEY, YOU'RE GETTING BETTER.

207
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,346
I'M GOING TO KEEP THIS, BY THE WAY.

208
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:28,648
OKAY...

209
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,650
HE KEPT MY DOLLAR.

210
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:38,658
 SO, YOUR FIRST WHOLE WEEKEND WITHOUT BEN.

211
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:39,659
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO DO?

212
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,661
WE'RE GOING DOWN TO COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG.

213
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,262
A WOMAN I WENT TO COLLEGE WITH

214
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,665
JUST BECAME THE FIRST FEMALE BLACKSMITH DOWN THERE.

215
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:46,466
WELL, YOU KNOW

216
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,468
THEY'RE A LITTLE BEHIND THE TIMES

217
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,669
IN COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG.

218
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,671
OKAY, WELL, LOOK, I BETTER GO

219
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,673
BEFORE MOMMY STARTS WEEPING.

220
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:54,474
BYE.

221
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,675
WE LOVE YOU.

222
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,876
"BYE, MOMMY. BYE, MOMMY."

223
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,878
HAVE A GOOD TIME. BYE.

224
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,279
OKAY, BEN...

225
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,080
ROSS?

226
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,281
YEAH?

227
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,483
LOOK.

228
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:13,092
JOEY, DO YOU KNOW WE CAN SEE YOU FROM HERE?

229
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,495
HOW COME RICHARD LOOKS SO MUCH COOLER

230
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,096
WITH ONE OF THESE THAN ME?

231
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,198
FOR STARTERS, YOU MAY WANT TO LIGHT IT

232
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,399
AND LOSE THE SPATULA.

233
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,301
 YOU KNOW WHAT?

234
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:23,603
I THINK IT'S CUTE--

235
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,204
YOU TRYING TO BE LIKE RICHARD.

236
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,106
NOT LIKE HIM, PER SE

237
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:30,710
JUST NOT UNLIKE HIM.

238
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,221
LOOK, IT'S THE ARTIST FORMALLY KNOWN AS CHANDLER.

239
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:46,626
I WAS JUST TRYING SOMETHING HERE, YOU KNOW?

240
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,628
JOEY, WHY DIDN'T YOU GROW A MUSTACHE?

241
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,829
OH, WE FLIPPED FOR IT.

242
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,231
I GOT THE CIGAR, HE GOT THE MUSTACHE.

243
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,334
WE FIGURED IF WE BOTH GREW THEM

244
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:56,936
WE'D LOOK LIKE DORKS.

245
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,738
YEAH, YOU REALLY SIDE STEPPED

246
00:08:58,738 --> 00:08:59,739
THAT LAND MINE.

247
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:00,940
HEY, LISTEN, WE GOT TO GO.

248
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,942
I PROMISED RICHARD WE'D MEET HIM DOWNSTAIRS.

249
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,143
YOU'RE MEETING RICHARD?

250
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,344
YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO A RANGER GAME.

251
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,145
DIDN'T HE TELL YOU?

252
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,346
HE TOLD ME HE WAS

253
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,147
GOING OUT WITH THE GUYS.

254
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,749
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE THE GUYS.

255
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:10,750
YOU HEAR THAT?

256
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:11,951
WE'RE "THE GUYS."

257
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,353
WE'RE "THE GUYS."

258
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,555
WITH THAT MUSTACHE

259
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,557
DOESN'T CHANDLER REMIND YOU OF AUNT SYLVIA?

260
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,357
THANK YOU!

261
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,868
HI. WE'RE VISITING.

262
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,469
YAY!

263
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,872
IT'S BEN AND HIS... DA DA.

264
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,675
DA DA.

265
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,276
CAN YOU SAY "DA DA"?

266
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,878
OH...

267
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,880
I'M GOING TO TELL YOUR MOMMIES YOU SAID IT ANYWAY

268
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,681
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL TRY.

269
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,282
NO LUCK, HUH?

270
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,085
NO. A WHILE AGO, I GOT A "SEH" OUT OF HIM

271
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,888
WHICH I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, MIGHT TURN INTO

272
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,290
"SEH CONDARY CAREGIVER," BUT...

273
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,294
HEY, WOULD YOU HOLD HIM FOR A SEC?

274
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,896
BECAUSE I GOT TO TAKE THIS OFF.

275
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,397
OH. YEAH.

276
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,999
SURE. OKAY.

277
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,806
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

278
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,609
I'M HOLDING BEN.

279
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,210
YEAH, WELL

280
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,212
HE'S A BABY, NOT A BOMB.

281
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,214
OKAY.

282
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,016
JUST HOLD HIM LIKE YOU'D HOLD A FOOTBALL.

283
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,819
THIS IS HOW I WOULD HOLD A FOOTBALL.

284
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,120
OKAY, HERE, HERE.

285
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,321
THERE WE GO.

286
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:23,522
OKAY. I'M SORRY.

287
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,524
I'M JUST NOT VERY GOOD WITH BABIES.

288
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,126
I MEAN, I HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND THEM.

289
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,128
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, SINCE I WAS ONE.

290
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,130
THAT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

291
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,331
REALLY? YEAH, DEFINITELY.

292
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,333
I'M SURE YOU'LL FEEL TOTALLY DIFFERENT

293
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:35,935
WHEN IT'S OUR BABY. WHAT?

294
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,536
WHAT?

295
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,939
YOU THINK ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT?

296
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,540
UH... YEAH.

297
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:45,144
I MEAN, ACTUALLY, I KIND OF THINK

298
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,546
THAT WE'LL HAVE... WE'LL HAVE TWO BABIES.

299
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:51,550
TWO... TWO BABIES?

300
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,152
YEAH. YOU KNOW, A BOY AND A GIRL.

301
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,154
HOPEFULLY, THE GIRL WILL COME FIRST

302
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,156
SO BEN HERE WON'T FEEL TOO COMPETITIVE.

303
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:01,961
UM... TH THEN WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?

304
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,363
WELL, WE WON'T WANT TO RAISE KIDS IN THE CITY

305
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,965
SO WE'LL PROBABLY MOVE TO SCARSDALE.

306
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,967
SCAR... UH HUH. THAT WAY, I FIGURE

307
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,568
WE'LL BE FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM OUR PARENTS

308
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,570
THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO SEE THEM ALL THE TIME

309
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,772
BUT CLOSE ENOUGH THAT THEY CAN

310
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:13,973
COME OVER AND BABY SIT WHENEVER WE WANT.

311
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,776
AND, YES, I KNOW THE TAXES ARE A LITTLE HIGHER

312
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,377
THAN, LET'S SAY, NASSAU COUNTY

313
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,780
BUT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM'S SUPPOSEDLY GREAT.

314
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,682
WOW.

315
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,084
WOW, THAT'S GREAT.

316
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,086
GREAT.

317
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,688
OKAY, WOW, YOU KNOW WHAT?

318
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,090
I'M OFF MY BREAK NOW

319
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,492
SO, UH, UM, HERE--

320
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,293
YOU TAKE THIS

321
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,295
AND, UM...

322
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,496
I AM GOING TO GO POUR

323
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,498
THESE VERY NICE PEOPLE SOME COFFEE.

324
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:40,700
OKAY.

325
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,901
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

326
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,102
I DON'T HAVE A POT.

327
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,203
I DON'T HAVE A POT.

328
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,305
WELL, HEY, MAYBE I'VE GOT ONE AT HOME...

329
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,106
OR IN SCARSDALE.

330
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:48,307
HEY, IS THAT A DOOR?

331
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,809
RACH?

332
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,315
HEY.

333
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,718
HEY, PHEEBS, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

334
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,319
OH, OKAY, MURDER, CANCER

335
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,722
SOCCER TEAMS EATING EACH OTHER IN THE ANDES.

336
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,125
I WAS REALLY JUST MAKING SMALL TALK.

337
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,927
OKAY, WELL, I WAS JUST VENTING.

338
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,030
SO YOU WATCHED THE MOVIES, HUH?

339
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,833
UH HUH. WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE WORLD?

340
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,434
I MEAN... NO, NO, NO.

341
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,637
BECAUSE E.T. LEAVES AND ROCKY LOSES.

342
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:19,839
CHARLOTTE DIES.

343
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,440
CHARLOTTE WHO?

344
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,042
WITH THE WEB. THE SPIDER.

345
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:24,343
SHE DIES.

346
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,945
SHE HAS BABIES AND DIES.

347
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,748
IT'S, LIKE, "HEY, WELCOME HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL." THUD.

348
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,550
ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT TO FEEL BETTER?

349
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,152
YEAH.

350
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,754
OKAY.

351
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,955
HERE. WATCH THIS.

352
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,556
IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.

353
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,558
YES, I'VE HEARD OF THIS.

354
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,160
SO YOU CAN'T LOSE.

355
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,762
IT'S THERE IN THE TITLE.

356
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,164
THE WONDERFULNESS IS BAKED RIGHT IN.

357
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,768
PLEASE, I ALMOST FELL FOR THAT WITH PRIDE OF THE YANKEES.

358
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,971
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO SEE A FILM ABOUT YANKEE PRIDE

359
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:55,274
AND THEN, BOOM, THE GUY GETS LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE.

360
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:56,876
THE GUY WAS LOU GEHRIG.

361
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,278
DIDN'T YOU KIND OF SEE IT COMING?

362
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,180
 PHOEBE, JUST WATCH THAT.

363
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,983
I PROMISE YOU IT WILL RESTORE ALL YOUR FAITH IN HUMANITY.

364
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,685
HEY, BIG GUY, GAME TIME.

365
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,387
HEY, BE RIGHT THERE.

366
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,989
THERE'S A GAME?

367
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,992
YEAH, I JUST GOT MY PICK UP STICKS

368
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,593
BACK FROM THE SHOP.

369
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,996
BRING YOUR NERVES OF STEEL.

370
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,398
IT'S THE BASKETBALL PLAY OFFS.

371
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,400
LISTEN, HONEY, I APPRECIATE THIS

372
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,004
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP HANGING OUT WITH THEM FOR ME.

373
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,006
I MEAN, THEY HAVE EACH OTHER.

374
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,607
OH, NO, HONEY, I MEAN, DON'T WORRY.

375
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,609
I LIKE HANGING OUT WITH THOSE GUYS.

376
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:31,811
IT'S FUN FOR ME.

377
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,213
THEY'RE DIFFERENT THAN MY OTHER FRIENDS.

378
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,815
THEY DON'T START SENTENCES

379
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:39,018
WITH, "YOU KNOW WHO JUST DIED SHOVELING SNOW?"

380
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,419
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S GREAT.

381
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,620
THEN JUST GO.

382
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,622
GO, KNICKS!

383
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,524
UH, IT'S THE COLLEGE PLAY OFFS.

384
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,026
OH. THEN... GO, VASSAR!

385
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,227
THEY'RE NOT IN IT.

386
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,428
OKAY, THEN JUST GO.

387
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,030
OKAY.

388
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,132
WHY DOES THIS BOTHER ME SO MUCH?

389
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,534
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

390
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,735
WHO TELLS THEIR BOYFRIEND

391
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,138
THEY WANT TO SPEND 24 HOURS A DAY WITH HIM.

392
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,739
SURE.

393
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,641
HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT MUCH FREE TIME.

394
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,243
I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO I DO?

395
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,444
DOES IT MATTER?

396
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,247
YOU'RE ULTIMATELY JUST GOING TO DIE OR GET DIVORCED

397
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,549
OR HAVE TO BLOW YOUR PET'S HEAD OFF.

398
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,451
UCH!

399
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,252
ME, TOO.

400
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:14,854
RACHEL, I GOT A QUESTION.

401
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,856
RICHARD MADE PLANS AGAIN WITH THE GUYS.

402
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,258
YEAH, WELL, ROSS JUST MADE PLANS

403
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,559
FOR THE WHOLE CENTURY.

404
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,561
I THINK I'M GOING TO GO TO MY ROOM AND READ COSMO.

405
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,563
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING HELPFUL IN THERE.

406
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,165
IF NOT, AT LEAST MAYBE I CAN LEARN HOW

407
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,968
TO DO AN AT HOME BIKINI WAX WITH LEFTOVER CHRISTMAS CANDLES.

408
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,370
OKAY, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED BACK THERE?

409
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,372
I DON'T KNOW. YOU TELL ME.

410
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,175
ONE MINUTE, I'M HOLDING BEN LIKE A FOOTBALL.

411
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,177
THE NEXT THING I KNOW, I'VE GOT TWO KIDS

412
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,980
I'M LIVING IN SCARSDALE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE TAXES.

413
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,082
WELL, I'M SORRY. I THINK ABOUT STUFF, YOU KNOW?

414
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,484
I MEAN, YOU'RE AT WORK, YOU'RE ASSEMBLING BONES

415
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:46,685
YOUR MIND WANDERS.

416
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,287
ROSS, YOU HAVE PLANNED OUT

417
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,089
THE NEXT 20 YEARS OF OUR LIVES.

418
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,091
WE'VE BEEN DATING FOR SIX WEEKS.

419
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,092
OH, COME ON. WHAT?

420
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,293
YOU NEVER THINK ABOUT OUR FUTURE?

421
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,895
YES, BUT I THINK ABOUT WHOSE APARTMENT

422
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,496
WE'RE GOING TO SLEEP AT TOMORROW NIGHT

423
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,899
AND WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE DINNER NEXT SATURDAY NIGHT.

424
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,401
I DO NOT THINK ABOUT WHAT OUR CHILDREN'S NAMES ARE GOING

425
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:03,602
TO BE.

426
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:04,503
YOU KNOW WHAT

427
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,505
OUR CHILDREN'S NAMES ARE GOING TO BE.

428
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,208
NO. NO. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I READ A BOOK

429
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,210
AND THERE WAS A GIRL NAMED EMILY

430
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,413
AND I THOUGHT... I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT BE GOOD.

431
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,116
WHAT WAS THE BOOK?

432
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,319
"THE BIG BOOK OF CHILDREN'S NAMES."

433
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,721
OKAY, ROSS, ROSS, OKAY, LISTEN.

434
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,323
WHAT WE HAVE IS AMAZING.

435
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:25,925
YEAH.

436
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,727
BUT I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE EVERYTHING DECIDED FOR ME.

437
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,329
I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE LIKE THAT.

438
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,931
THAT'S WHAT I HAD WITH BARRY.

439
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,532
THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS I LEFT.

440
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,534
I LIKE NOT KNOWING RIGHT NOW.

441
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,136
AND I'M SORRY IF THAT SCARES YOU

442
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,337
BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE WITH ME

443
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,939
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT.

444
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,040
OKAY, FINE.

445
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,840
THANK YOU.

446
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,641
WE'RE NOT DONE.

447
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,643
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

448
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,245
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

449
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,846
THAT YOU'RE WITH A GUY

450
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,448
WHO'S NOT GOING TO STOP PLANNING HIS FUTURE WITH YOU

451
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,450
BECAUSE HE KNOWS WE'RE GOING TO END UP TOGETHER

452
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,651
AND IF THAT SCARES YOU, TOUGH

453
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,253
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT.

454
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:55,454
FINE. I WILL.

455
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,655
GOOD. BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

456
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,457
YEAH. OH, YEAH? I LOVE YOU, TOO.

457
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,059
WELL, THAT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'VE SAID THAT.

458
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:00,859
YES, IT IS.

459
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:01,660
I'M GOING TO KISS YOU.

460
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,461
WELL, YOU BETTER.

461
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,069
HEY.

462
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,270
HEY.

463
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,871
OH, THANKS FOR THE GREAT MOVIE TIP.

464
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,274
OH, YEAH. DID YOU LIKE IT?

465
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,976
I DON'T KNOW IF I WAS HAPPIER

466
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,577
WHEN GEORGE BAILEY DESTROYED THE FAMILY BUSINESS

467
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,179
OR DONNA REED CRIED

468
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,982
OR WHEN THE MEAN PHARMACIST MADE HIS EAR BLEED.

469
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,883
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GIVE YOU THE EAR THING

470
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,686
BUT DON'T YOU THINK THE ENDING WAS PRETTY WONDERFUL?

471
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,088
I DIDN'T WATCH THE ENDING.

472
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,689
I WAS TOO DEPRESSED.

473
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,691
IT JUST KEPT GETTING WORSE AND WORSE.

474
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,094
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED IT'S A SUCKY LIFE

475
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,297
AND JUST WHEN YOU THINK IT CAN'T SUCK ANY MORE, IT DOES.

476
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,699
KICK SAVE

477
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,102
AND DENIED.

478
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,703
BUT HE GETS IT BACK

479
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:47,506
PASS TO THE MIDDLE, LINES IT UP

480
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,707
AND, BAM, YES!

481
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:52,111
COULD THAT SHOT BE ANY PRETTIER?

482
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,113
MAN, YOU ARE INCREDIBLE.

483
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,115
WELL, WE HAD A TABLE IN COLLEGE.

484
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,318
REALLY? I DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAD FOOSBALL IN THE 1800s.

485
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,720
NICE MUSTACHE, BY THE WAY.

486
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,322
WHEN PUBERTY HITS

487
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,724
THAT THING'S REALLY GOING TO KICK IN.

488
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,629
HONEY, NOT TO SOUND TOO FLORENCE HENDERSON

489
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:11,830
BUT DINNER'S ON THE TABLE.

490
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,432
OKAY, JUST ONE MORE POINT.

491
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,637
 SCORE!

492
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:21,040
NOW CAN WE GO?

493
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,842
SEE, THAT'S WHY WE DON'T LET HER PLAY.

494
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,046
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

495
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,647
MM HMM.

496
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:29,848
UH OH.

497
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:30,949
HEY, LISTEN, DON'T BE MAD AT HIM.

498
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,151
IT'S OUR FAULT.

499
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,452
I'M SORRY WE'VE BEEN HOGGING

500
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,054
SO MUCH OF HIS TIME.

501
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,655
YEAH, HE'S JUST REALLY GREAT TO HANG OUT WITH.

502
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,257
NO, SERIOUSLY. WELL...

503
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,259
CHANDLER AND I WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS.

504
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,860
HE IS SO MUCH COOLER THAN OUR DADS.

505
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,663
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, OUR DADS ARE OKAY AND ALL

506
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:47,066
BUT RICHARD IS JUST... OW! OW!

507
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,468
WHAT ARE YOU KICKING ME FOR?

508
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,070
HUH?

509
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,472
I'M TRYING TO TALK HERE.

510
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:57,876
UH... YOU GUYS SEE ME AS A DAD?

511
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,078
OH, YEAH.

512
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,679
NO.

513
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,281
NO.

514
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,084
 YOU'RE JUST CLEARLY NOT FAMILIAR

515
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,886
WITH OUR YOUNG PERSON'S VERNACULAR.

516
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,490
SEE, WHEN WE SAY "DAD," WE MEAN "BUDDY."

517
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,092
WE MEAN "PAL."

518
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,293
UH HUH. YEAH.

519
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,496
NO, SERIOUSLY, JOEY'S MY DAD.

520
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,100
MONICA'S MY DAD.

521
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,104
I'VE EVEN GOT SOME DADS DOWN AT WORK.

522
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,305
THAT'S FINE.

523
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,906
WELL, YOUR OTHER DAD AND I

524
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,309
ARE GOING TO GO HAVE A ROMANTIC EVENING

525
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,112
AND I GUESS I'LL JUST SEE YOU KIDS AROUND.

526
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,713
NIGHTY NIGHT.

527
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,715
 YOU'RE NOT A DAD.

528
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,117
YOU'RE NOT A DAD.

529
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,919
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GOT US INTO TROUBLE.

530
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,134
SO, ARE YOU OKAY?

531
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:56,335
YEAH.

532
00:18:56,735 --> 00:19:00,739
IT'S JUST I FEEL LIKE I'M ABOUT A HUNDRED.

533
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:04,743
I THOUGHT I WAS JUST ONE OF THE GUYS.

534
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,345
COME HERE.

535
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:09,548
I'LL MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE ONE OF THE GUYS.

536
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,055
YOU KNOW, FOR A REALLY COOL GUY

537
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,657
YOU SUCK AT FOOSBALL.

538
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,460
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

539
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,061
I WAS KILLING THEM.

540
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,063
YEAH, WELL, THEY SUCK, TOO.

541
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,667
THEN YOU TAKE THE POOPY DIAPER

542
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,669
AND YOU PUT IT IN THE POOPY DIAPER PAIL.

543
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,870
OKAY, ROSS, JUST SO YOU KNOW

544
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,472
CALLING IT A "POOPY DIAPER"

545
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,073
DOESN'T MAKE THIS PROCESS ANY CUTER.

546
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,675

547
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,476
HELLO.

548
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:38,677
 It's us.

549
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,279
COME ON UP.

550
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,081
I'M GOING TO GET THE REST OF HIS STUFF TOGETHER.

551
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:46,084
OKAY, WE CAN DO THIS, NOW, CAN'T WE, BEN?

552
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,686
YES, WE CAN.

553
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,688
YES, WE CAN.

554
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,192
THERE. I DID IT.

555
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,594
OH HO! I DID IT.

556
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:56,795
OOH!

557
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,397
LOOK AT THAT.

558
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:01,200

578
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,138
 WHAT DID HE SAY?

579
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,740
SOMETHING ABOUT "HI."

580
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,142
OH, THAT'S SO EXCITING.

00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,144

00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,458
YOU'RE RIGHT.

591
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,460
WE'VE GOT A CAB WAITING DOWNSTAIRS.

592
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,661
THIS WAS FUN.

593
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,364
WE SHOULD REALLY DO IT AGAIN SOMETIME, BEN.

594
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,965
WHAT DO YOU SAY? OKAY.

595
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,967
SO I'VE GOT HIM... TUESDAY.

596
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:09,768
TUESDAY. RIGHT.

597
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,370
OKAY, BYE, YOU GUYS.

598
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,571
TAKE CARE.

599
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,772
BYE, BEN.

600
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,374
 BYE.

601
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,378
DID HE JUST... DID HE JUST SAY "BYE"?

602
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,579
HE SAID "BYE."

603
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:22,180
HE SAID "BYE" TO ME!

604
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:23,782
HE SAID "BYE" TO ME!

605
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,484
YES, HE DID.

606
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,886
SUDDENLY I'M SEEING HIM GO OFF TO COLLEGE.

607
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,488
WE GOT TO GO.

608
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,490
WE GOT THAT CAB DOWNSTAIRS.

609
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,691
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

610
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,293
SEE YOU LATER.

611
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,494
BYE.

612
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,095
 BYE.

613
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,196
BYE!

614
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,999
 BYE.

615
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,401
BYE!

616
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,803
OHH!

618
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,813
Oh, wow. Look at this nice deep hole I've been digging.

619
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:58,116
Hey, Bert, isn't this a nice hole here?

620
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,718
OKAY, BEN, THIS IS THE PART

621
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,921
WHERE ERNIE BURIES BERT IN THE SAND AND CAN'T FIND HIM.

622
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,724
NOW, I'VE LOOKED AHEAD ON THE TAPE

623
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,126
AND HE DOES FIND HIM AGAIN.

624
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,728
BUT, OKAY, BEFORE THAT HAPPENS

625
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:13,332
THERE'S SOME PRETTY ROUGH GOING FOR A WHILE.

626
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,134
BUT I THINK WE CAN HANDLE IT.

627
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:20,939
AND THERE'S JUST THE ALPHABET, BUT WE KNOW THAT ENDS WELL.

628
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,140
SO... OKAY, HERE WE GO.

629
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,644
Bert? Bert? Bert?

630
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,946
Hey, what happened to my friend Bert?

631
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,848
He was here just a moment ago.

632
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,850
Oh, no, my old friend Bert is lost.

633
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,852
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
