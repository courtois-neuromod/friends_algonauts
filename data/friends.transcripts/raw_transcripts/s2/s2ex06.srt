7
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:15,715

8
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:18,518
WHY IS HE STILL CRYING?

9
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,020
DON'T WORRY.

10
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,024
IT'S NOTHING THAT CAN'T BE SOLVED BY HAPPY KEYS.

11
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,325
YEAH, I ALWAYS FEEL MUCH BETTER

12
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,727

HUH? HUH? THERE WE ARE.

17
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:40,040
MAYBE IT'S ME.

00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,741
DON'T BE SILLY. BEN LOVES YOU.

19
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:44,144
HE'S JUST BEING MR. CRANKY PANTS.

20

25
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,661

26
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,464
CAN I... UH... SEE SOMETHING?

27
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,267

28
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:10,870

29
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,373

30
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:15,775

31
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:18,178

32
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,379
COOL.

33
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,880
HE HATES ME.

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,482
MY NEPHEW HATES ME.

35
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,484
I'M UNEMPLOYED, AND MY NEPHEW HATES ME.

36
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,086
OH, STOP. DON'T DO THIS.

37
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,687
YOU'RE JUST UNEMPLOYED.

38
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,692
WHAT IF MY OWN BABY HATES ME? WHAT THEN?

39
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:33,993
MONICA, THIS IS NUTS.

40
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,595
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO BE

41
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,597
BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO DEAL

42
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,498
WITH THIS PROBLEM?

43
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,900
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A BOYFRIEND YET.

44
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,407
JOEY, SHE DOES NOT LOOK FAT.

45
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:52,112

58
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,053
HERE YOU GO.

59
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,655
OH, HEY, MON.

60
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,858

61
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:40,860
GOO! GOO! GOO!

62
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,263

63
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,564
THAT IS SO FUNNY.

64
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,765
LET ME SEE THAT A SEC.

65
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,972

66
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,474
UGH...

67
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,675
YOU OKAY, ROSS?

68
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,677
I DON'T KNOW. UGH...

69
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,580
WHAT'S IN THIS PIE?

70
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,182
I DON'T KNOW.

71
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,984
BUTTER AND EGGS AND FLOUR AND LIME AND KIWI...

72
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,886
KIWI? KIWI?

73
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,689
YOU SAID IT WAS A KEY LIME PIE.

74
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,691
NO, I DIDN'T. I SAID KIWILIME.

75
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,693
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO SPECIAL.

76
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,696
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO KILL ME.

77
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,098
I'M ALLERGIC TO KIWI.

78
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,300
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

79
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,702
YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO LOBSTER AND PEANUTS AND...

80
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,504

81
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,906
OH, MY GOD.

82
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,908
IT'S DEFINITELY GETTING WORSE.

83
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:31,511
IS YOUR TONGUE SWELLING UP?

84
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,814
EITHER THAT OR MY MOUTH IS GETTING SMALLER.

85
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:35,715
GET YOUR COAT.

86
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,317
WE'RE GOING TO THE HOSPITAL.

87
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,518
WILL HE BE OKAY?

88
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:39,719
YEAH. HE NEEDS A SHOT.

89
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,522
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, IT'S GETTING BETTER.

90
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,524
IT IS. LET'S NOT GO.

91
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,125
ANYONE UP FOR SCRABBLE?

92
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,128
JACKET NOW!

93
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,330
BUT WHAT ABOUT BEN?

94
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,732
WE CAN'T BRING A BABY TO THE HOTHPITAL.

95
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,334
WE'LL WATCH HIM.

96
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,335

97
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,936
I DON'T THINK SO.

98
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:59,339
WHAT? I HAVE SEVEN CATHOLIC SISTERS.

99
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,741
I'VE TAKEN CARE OF HUNDREDS OF KIDS.

100
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,343
COME ON.

101
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,245
WE WANT TO DO IT, DON'T WE?

102
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,647
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING BASKETBALL

103
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,049
BUT I GUESS THAT'S OUT THE WINDOW.

104
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,453
IF YOU TAKE HIM FOR HIS WALK, BWING HIS HAT.

105
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,656
THERE'S MILK IN THE FWIDGE AND DIAPERS IN THE BAG.

106
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,459
HAT, MILK, DI... GOT IT.

107
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,960
LET'S GO.

108
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,763

109
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,766
THRO UP A THRO THRO-- A THRO THRO.

110
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,370
CONSIDER IT DONE!

111
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,871
YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT?

112
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,875
YEAH. MY UNCLE SAL HAS A REALLY BIG TONGUE.

113
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,177
IS HE THE ONE WITH THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE?

114
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,586
RACH, WANT TO HEAR THE NEW SONG

115
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,588
I'M THINKING OF SINGING THIS AFTERNOON?

116
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,089
I WROTE IT IN THE SHOWER.

117
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,691

COULD I SEE YOU FOR A MINUTE?

127
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,025
WHAT'S UP?

128
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,428
F.Y.I., I'VE DECIDED

129
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,029
TO PAY A PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN

130
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,031
TO PLAY HERE ON SUNDAY AFTERNOONS.

131
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,633
HER NAME IS STEPHANIE...

132
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,234
SOMETHING.

133
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,236
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE VERY GOOD.

134
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,639
BUT WHAT ABOUT PHOEBE?

135
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,442
RACHEL, IT'S NOT THAT YOUR FRIEND IS BAD.

136
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:46,045
IT'S... IT'S THAT SHE'S SO BAD

137
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,248
SHE MAKES ME WANT TO PUT MY FINGER

138
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,051
THROUGH MY EYE INTO MY BRAIN

139
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:54,053
AND SWIRL IT AROUND.

140
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,456
OKAY.

141
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,458
OKAY, SO YOU'RE NOT A FAN.

142
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,059
BUT, I MEAN, COME ON.

143
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,061
YOU CANNOT DO THIS TO HER.

144
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,063
UH...

145
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,665

YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK WE BROUGHT ENOUGH STUFF.

152
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,389
DID YOU FORGET TO PACK THE BABY'S ANVIL?

153
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,391
IT'S GOING TO BE WORTH IT.

154
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,293
IT'S A KNOWN FACT THAT WOMEN LOVE BABIES.

155
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,696
WOMEN LOVE GUYS WHO LOVE BABIES.

156
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,698
IT'S THE WHOLE SENSITIVE THING.

157
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,700
AIM HIM AT THAT PACK OF BABES.

158
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,102
MAYBE ONE OF THEM WILL BREAK AWAY.

159
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,104
NO, NO, WAIT. FORGET THEM.

160
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,407
WE GOT ONE HARD LEFT.

161
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,808
GIVE ME THE BABY.

162
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,009
NO, I'VE GOT HIM.

163
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,210
COME ON, SERIOUSLY.

164
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,212
OH, SERIOUSLY YOU WANT HIM?

165
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,714
HELLO.

166
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,716
HELLO. HELLO.

167
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,218
AND WHO IS THIS LITTLE CUTIE PIE?

168
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,621
WELL, DON'T THINK ME IMMODEST, BUT...

169
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,222
ME?

170
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,225
YOU WANT TO SMELL HIM?

171
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,628
I ASSUME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BABY NOW.

172
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:10,630
OH, YEAH.

173
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,632
HE'S GOT THAT GREAT BABY SMELL.

174
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,634
GET A WHIFF OF HIS HEAD.

175
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,638
I THINK MY UTERUS JUST SKIPPED A BEAT.

176
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,040
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

177
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,142
IT'S GREAT YOU'RE DOING THIS.

178
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:26,045
WELL, WE ARE GREAT GUYS.

179
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,347
MY BROTHER AND HIS BOYFRIEND HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ADOPT.

180
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,750
WHAT AGENCY DID YOU TWO GO THROUGH?

181
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,356
BUT THIS IS MY GIG.

182
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,358
THIS IS WHERE I PLAY.

183
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,761
MY NAME IS WRITTEN OUT THERE IN CHALK.

184
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,564
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T JUST ERASE CHALK.

185
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,368
HONEY, I'M SORRY.

186
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,771
AND HE'S GOING TO BE PAYING THIS WOMAN?

187
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,173
WHY DOESN'T HE GIVE HER A THRONE?

188
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,175
AND A CROWN, AND, LIKE, A...

189
00:07:56,175 --> 00:08:00,379
YOU KNOW... GOLD STICK WITH A BALL ON TOP?

190
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,981
TERRY IS A JERK.

191
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,184
THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALWAYS SAYING, "TERRY'S A JERK."

192
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,587
THAT'S WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

193
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,489
YEAH, OKAY.

194
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,891
YOU PROBABLY DID EVERYTHING YOU COULD.

195
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,094
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

196
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:19,098
LET ME JUST SEE WHAT ELSE I CAN DO.

197
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,301
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET HER GO ON AFTER

198
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,503

199
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,305
YOU WON'T BE HERE, YOU DON'T PAY HER.

200
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,107

TERRY, I'LL EVEN CLEAN THE CAPPUCCINO MACHINE.

202
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,912
YOU DON'T CLEAN THE CAPPUCCINO MACHINE?

203
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,515
OF COURSE...

204
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,517

205
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,319
I MEAN, I WILL CLEAN IT.

206
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,021
I WILL CLEAN IT.

BECAUSE SHE'S A PROFESSIONAL.

220
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:12,351
I'M NOT GOING TO BE THE ONLY ONE WHO'S NOT GETTING PAID.

221
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,553
BUT, PHEEBS...

00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,662
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PLACES IN THIS CITY

226
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,464
WHERE PEOPLE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PAY TO HEAR ME PLAY.

227
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,567

228
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,770

229
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,772

THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING TO GET A SHOT.

233
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,981
MAYBE THEY CAN TAKE THE NEEDLE

234
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,985
AND THQUIRT IT INTO MY MOUTH LIKE A THQUIRT GUN.

235
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,186
HONEY, WHY DON'T WE JUST WAIT

236
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,788
AND SEE WHAT THE DOCTOR SAYS?

237
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,790
THEY'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING.

238
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,391
THESE ARE THE '90s!

239
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,893
HELLO, THERE.

240
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,094
I'M DR. KARLEN.

241
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:59,498
I SEE SOMEONE'S HAVING A LITTLE ALLERGIC REACTION.

242
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:03,302
DOCTOR, CAN I SEE YOU FOR JUST A MOMENT, PLEASE?

243
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,904
MY BROTHER HAS

244
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:08,107
A SLIGHT PHOBIA ABOUT NEEDLES.

245
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,109
DID YOU TELL HIM ABOUT MY THQUIRT GUN IDEA?

246
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,212
MY BROTHER, THE Ph.D.

247
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,816
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE'S ANY WAY TO TREAT THIS ORALLY.

248
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,818
NO. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES

249
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:22,822
IT HAS TO BE AN INJECTION AND IT HAS TO BE NOW.

250
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,423
THO?

251
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,126

THAT'S GOOD. HAVE A SEAT.

253
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,530
DOCTOR SAYS IT'S GOT TO BE A NEEDLE.

254
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,933
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE BRAVE, OKAY?

255
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,736
CAN YOU DO THAT FOR ME?

256
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,738
OKAY.

257
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,139
OKAY. OH, BOY!

258
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,541
YOU ARE DOING SO GOOD.

259
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,945
YOU WANT TO SQUEEZE MY HAND?

260
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,146
YEAH.

261
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,148
DON'T SQUEEZE IT SO HARD.

262
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,951
REALLY, DON'T SQUEEZE IT SO HARD.

263
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,953
OW! LET GO OF MY HAND!

264
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,858
THAT'S A GOOD PLAN.

265
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,260
NEXT TIME WE WANT TO PICK UP WOMEN

266
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,262
WE'LL JUST GO TO THE PARK AND MAKE OUT.

267
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,864

CAN YOU TELL HIM THAT?

275
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,685
BECAUSE HE THINKS HE LOOKS TOO PINK.

276
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,487
SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS OUT DOING TODAY?

277
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,890

ARE YOU SURE HE DIDN'T BREAK IT?

305
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,258
IT REALLY HURTS.

OH! OH, WAIT!

00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:00,960
THAT ONE'S DEFINITELY BEN.

388
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,362

00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,472
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

396
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,675
WE'LL FLIP FOR IT-- DUCKS OR CLOWNS.

398
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,078
YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA?

399
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,679
CALL IT IN THE AIR.

00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:40,299
DUCKS IS HEADS BECAUSE DUCKS HAVE HEADS.

00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:47,106
WHAT KIND OF SCARY ASS CLOWNS CAME TO YOUR BIRTHDAY?

410
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,915
? THERE'LL BE NO STRINGS TO BIND YOUR HANDS ?

411
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:01,320
? NOT IF MY LOVE CAN'T BIND YOUR HEART ?

412
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,326
? AND THERE'S NO NEED TO TAKE A STAND ?

413
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:11,330
? FOR IT WAS I WHO CHOSE TO START ?

414
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,137

415
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:24,543

421
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,257

426
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,477
? MAYBE THE SUN'S LIGHT WILL BE DIM ?

427
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:02,081
? SO IT WON'T MATTER ANYHOW ?

428
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,487
? IF MORNING'S ECHO SAYS WE'VE SINNED ?

429
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:12,491
? WELL, IT WAS WHAT I WANTED NOW ?

430
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:20,099
? AND IF WE'RE VICTIMS OF THE NIGHT ?

431
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,703
? I WON'T BE BLINDED BY THE LIGHT ?

432
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:29,408
? JUST CALL ME ANGEL OF THE MORNING ?

433
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,210

438
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:51,230
? I WON'T BEG YOU TO STAY ?

439
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,632

440
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,036
? THROUGH THE TEARS ?

441
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,242
? OF THE PAIN ?

442
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,646
? OF THE YEARS ?

443
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,449
? BABY ?

444
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:11,750
? BABY ?

445
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,152

453
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:37,276

454
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,883
HEY.

00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,084
OH, HI.

00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,887
HERE. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE COLD.

457
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,489
THANK YOU.

458
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,497
WHOA, LOOK AT YOU.

459
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,698
YOU DID PRETTY WELL.

460
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:03,001
$8.27 DOLLAR.

461
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,804
BUT NOT REALLY, BECAUSE I PUT IN THE FIRST TWO.

462
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:08,106
JUST TO, YOU KNOW, GET THE BALL ROLLING

463
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:11,310
AND TO MAKE MYSELF FEEL BETTER.

464
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,511
DO YOU?

465
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,112
NO.

466
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:17,716
YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE, LIKE, PLAYING FOR MONEY THING

467
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,318
IS SO NOT GOOD FOR ME.

468
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,919
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

469
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,921
WHEN I SANG "SU SU SUICIDE"

470
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:28,126
I GOT, LIKE... I GOT $1.75 DOLLAR.

471
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,229
BUT THEN "SMELLY CAT"?

472
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,534
I GOT 25 CENTS AND A CONDOM.

473
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,636
SO, YOU KNOW, NOW

474
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,639
I JUST FEEL REALLY BAD FOR "SMELLY CAT."

475
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,442
WELL, YOU KNOW, HONEY

476
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:47,446
I DON'T THINK EVERYBODY GETS "SMELLY CAT."

477
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,249
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, IF ALL YOU'VE EVER ACTUALLY HAD

478
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,452

479
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,154
BUT IT'S NOT EVEN THAT, YOU KNOW?

480
00:20:56,154 --> 00:21:00,158
I USED TO DO MY SONGS BECAUSE IT MADE ME HAPPY.

481
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:03,762
NOW IT'S, LIKE, IT'S JUST ALL ABOUT THE MONEY, YOU KNOW?

482
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,966
WELL, PEOPLE MISSED YOU IN THERE.

483
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:11,970
AND, IN FACT, THERE WAS ACTUALLY A REQUEST FOR "SMELLY CAT."

484
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,772
REALLY?! FROM WHO?

485
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,674
WELL, ME.

486
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,577

488
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,981
OH...

489
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,583
OH!

490
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:28,186
HI. DID I ACCIDENTALLY DROP A CONDOM IN YOUR CASE?

491
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,294
IT'S KIND OF AN EMERGENCY.

492
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,895
YEAH. HERE YOU GO.

493
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,196
HEY, THANKS A LOT.

00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,198
HEY, CHRISTINE, I GOT IT!

495
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:50,108
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE FOR ME TODAY.

496
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,511
I'M SORRY I ALMOST BROKE YOUR HAND.

497
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,712
OH, THAT'S OKAY.

498
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,014
I'M SORRY I POISONED YOU.

499
00:21:56,014 --> 00:22:00,018
HEY, REMEMBER THE TIME I JAMMED THAT PENCIL INTO YOUR HAND?

500
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,620
REMEMBER IT?

501
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,823
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS-- A FRECKLE?

502
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,425
WHAT ABOUT THE TIME

503
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,628
I HIT YOU IN THE FACE WITH THE SYLVIANS' PUMPKIN?

504
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,229
REMEMBER WHEN I STUCK THAT BROOM

505
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,231
IN YOUR BIKE SPOKES AND YOU FLIPPED

506
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,833
AND HIT YOUR HEAD ON THE CURB?

507
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,435
NO.

508
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,437
BUT I REMEMBER PEOPLE TELLING ME ABOUT IT.

509
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,638
OH.

510
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,841
I HOPE BEN HAS A LITTLE SISTER.

511
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,042
YEAH.

512
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,445
I HOPE SHE CAN KICK HIS ASS.

513
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:27,646

514
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,048
I'M GOING TO GET A NEW BAND AID.

515
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:33,652
HOW ABOUT THE TIME I CUT THE LEGS OFF YOUR MALIBU KEN?

516
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,054
THAT WAS YOU?!

517
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,358
UH... THEY WERE INFECTED.

518
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,360
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT.

00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:46,465
