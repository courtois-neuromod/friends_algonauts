1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,404
CHANDLER, MON, THERE'S ONLY ONE BANANA NUT MUFFIN LEFT.

2
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:06,006
I ORDERED MINE FIRST.

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,008
YEAH, BUT I'M SO MUCH FASTER.

4
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:10,810
GIVE IT TO ME.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:11,711
NO.

6
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,713
GIVE IT TO ME!

7
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:16,116
OKAY, YOU CAN HAVE IT.

8
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:24,924
THERE YOU GO.

9
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:26,526
ENJOY YOUR COFFEE.

10
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:29,729
THAT WAS THERE WHEN I GOT HERE.

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,733
HEY, YOU GUYS, YOU WILL NEVER GUESS

12
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,735
WHO'S COMING TO NEW YORK.

13
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:38,838
QUICK, PHOEBE, TELL US BEFORE HE CAN SWALLOW.

14
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,340
RYAN, THAT GUY I WENT OUT WITH

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,541
WHO'S IN THE NAVY.

16
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,742

17
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,844
YOU WENT OUT WITH A GUY IN THE NAVY?

18
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,446
I MET HIM WHEN I WAS PLAYING GUITAR

19
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,647
IN WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK.

20
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,049
RYAN THREW IN SALTWATER TAFFY

21
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,650
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CHANGE.

22
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,453
IS THAT WHEN YOU WROTE "SALTWATER TAFFY MAN"?

23
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,255
NO.

24
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,458
NO. HE IS MY SUBMARINE GUY.

25
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,460
HE RESURFACES, LIKE, EVERY COUPLE YEARS

26
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,663
AND WE HAVE THE MOST AMAZING THREE DAYS TOGETHER.

27
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:06,066
ONLY, THIS TIME, HE'S COMING FOR TWO WEEKS.

28
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,068
TWO WHOLE WEEKS-- WHICH MEANS YAY!

29
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:12,572
THIS GUY GOES DOWN FOR, LIKE, TWO YEARS AT A TIME?

30
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,375

31
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,777
THAT WILL TEACH YOU TO LICK MY MUFFIN.

32
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,180

33
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,984
HI.

34
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:26,586
OH, NO. WHAT HAPPENED?

35
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,787
I JUST SPOKE TO CAROL.

36
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:28,988
BEN'S GOT THE CHICKEN POX.

37
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,590
YOU'RE KIDDING. OH, NO.

38
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,192
SO IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY HAD IT

39
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,194
CHANCES ARE YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT.

40
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:35,795
I'VE HAD IT. I'VE HAD IT.

41
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:36,996
HAD IT. HAD IT.

42
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,199
I'VE NEVER HAD IT. I FEEL SO LEFT OUT.

57
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,556
HONEY, YOU MADE THE BED AGAIN.

58
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,259
I TOLD YOU, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

59
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,059
THIS ISN'T CAMP.

60
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,862
OH. THEN I GUESS THE PANTY RAID LAST NIGHT

61
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,464
WAS TOTALLY UNCALLED FOR.

62
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,065
OKAY.

63
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,467
I AM GOING TO TAKE A SHOWER

64
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,068
AND TODAY I WILL BE SINGING

65
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,670
JIM CROCE'S "LEROY BROWN."

66
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:02,682
MONICA?

67
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,084
HEY, MON, I HAVE A QUESTION.

68
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,286
IS LEROY

69
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,388
THE "BADDEST" MAN IN THE WHOLE DAMN TOWN

70
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,990
OR THE "FATTEST" MAN IN THE WHOLE DAMN TOWN?

71
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,192
THE BADDEST.

72
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,795
OTHERWISE THE SONG WOULD BE "FAT, FAT LEROY BROWN."

73
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,697
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

74
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:22,302
I'M JUST WAITING FOR YOU, SWEETIE.

75
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:27,106
ARE YOU REMAKING THE BED?

76
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,308
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

77
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,110
THE WAY YOU DID IT, IT WAS JUST FINE.

78
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,513
THEN YOU'RE REDOING IT BECAUSE...?

79
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,515
IF I TELL YOU, YOU'LL THINK I'M CRAZY.

80
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:39,719
YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH RUNNING THAT RISK EITHER WAY.

81
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,522
OKAY, YOU SEE...

82
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:46,125
THE DUVET TAG SHOULDN'T BE AT THE TOP LEFT CORNER.

83
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,528
IT SHOULD BE AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER.

84
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,830
WELL, THAT'S NOT SO CRAZY.

85
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,831
I'M JUST EASING YOU IN.

86
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,234
ALL RIGHT.

87
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,736
YOU SEE THESE LITTLE FLOWER BLOSSOMS?

88
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,638
THEY SHOULD BE FACING UP, NOT DOWN

89
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:02,642
BECAUSE THE HEAD OF THE BED IS WHERE THE SUN WOULD BE.

90
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,648
YOU DON'T LOVE ME ANYMORE, DO YOU?

91
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:14,153
ACTUALLY, IF IT'S POSSIBLE, I LOVE YOU MORE.

92
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,855
REALLY?

93
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,557
MM HMM.

94
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:18,458
WOW.

95
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,460
THEN COME ON, I WANT TO SHOW YOU

96
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,263
HOW TO FOLD THE TOILET PAPER INTO A POINT.

97
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,267
 HEY, LOOK, JOEY, I'M JUST SAYING

98
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,269
IF YOU NEED SOMETHING TO HOLD YOU OVER

99
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,472
I CAN GET YOU A JOB RIGHT HERE AS AN ENTRY LEVEL PROCESSOR.

100
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,275
BUT DON'T YOU NEED EXPERIENCE FOR A JOB LIKE THAT?

101
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,378
IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO LEARN, AND AS FOR PEOPLE REALIZING

102
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,780
THAT YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE DOING

103
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,981
HEY, YOU'RE AN ACTOR.

104
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,983
ACT LIKE A PROCESSOR, PEOPLE WILL THINK

105
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:44,784
YOU'RE A PROCESSOR.

106
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,085
HEY, CHANDLER, HERE'S

107
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,687
THIS MORNING'S PROJECTIONS.

108
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,290
THANKS. SCOTT ALEXANDER, JOEY TRIBBIANI.

109
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,493
JOEY IS A, UH, FELLOW PROCESSOR.

110
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,395
NO KIDDING?

111
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,797
OH, YEAH.

112
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,799
I PROCESS.

113
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,002
PEOPLE WANT THE PROCESSING, I'M THE ONE THEY CALL.

114
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,305
WHERE DO YOU WORK?

115
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,707
UH... RIGHT NOW, I'M IN BETWEEN THINGS.

116
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:08,708
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

117
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,310
ONE DAY, YOU'RE PROCESSING.

118
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,911
THE NEXT DAY, YOU'RE...

119
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,513
NOT SO MUCH PROCESSING ANYMORE.

120
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,214
I WAS JUST TELLING JOEY

121
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,216
ABOUT THE OPENING IN FLEISCHMAN'S GROUP.

122
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,418
FLEISCHMAN'S GROUP?

123
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,021
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T TOUCH HIS SANDWICHES.

124
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,627
ARE ALL YOU PROCESSORS DORKS?

125
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,735
UCH, THIS LIPSTICK LOOKS JUST GREAT ON YOU.

126
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,938
YOU LOOK FABULOUS, HONEY, YOU REALLY DO.

127
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,540
ARE YOU SURE? REALLY?

128
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,944
SEE? YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

129
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,946
FOR GOD SAKES, DIM THE LIGHTS.

130
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:50,550
I... I... I... I'M HIDEOUS.

131
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,251
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

132
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,453
RYAN'S BEEN UNDERWATER.

133
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,455
HE'S JUST GOING TO BE SO GLAD

134
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,857
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE BARNACLES ON YOUR BUTT.

135
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,271
 COME IN.

136
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,574
HEY, BABY, I'M BA...

137
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,477
HEY, RYAN, WHAT'S UP?

138
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,480
WHAT'S GOING ON?

139
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,682
NO, YOU HAVE TO STAY BACK.

140
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,084
I... I HAVE THE POX.

141
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:30,089
CHICKEN OR SMALL?

142
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:33,693
CHICKEN, WHICH IS SO IRONIC, CONSIDERING I'M A VEGETARIAN.

143
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,496
WHY AREN'T YOU AT HOME IN BED?

144
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,598
BECAUSE MY GRANDMOTHER'S NEVER HAD CHICKEN POX.

145
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,600
PLEASE, PLEASE TELL ME YOU HAVE

146
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,403
BECAUSE, OH, MY GOD, I FORGOT HOW CUTE YOU ARE.

147
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,905
I'M SORRY. I NEVER HAD THEM.

148
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,707
OH! OH!

149
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,108
IF I HAD ONE WISH

150
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,110
IT WOULD BE TO BUILD A TIME MACHINE

151
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,712
GO BACK TO WHEN I WAS SEVEN

152
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,714
WHEN JIMMY HAUSER HAD THE CHICKEN POX.

153
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,517
I WOULD GRAB THAT KID AND RUB HIM ALL OVER MY FACE.

154
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,118
OR YOU COULD JUST WISH

155
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,521
THAT I DIDN'T HAVE THEM NOW.

156
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,222
CAN I PLEASE SEE YOUR FACE?

157
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:06,025
NO. YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE A FACE COVERED WITH POX.

158
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,428
YOUR FACE COULD BE COVERED WITH LOX

159
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,029
I WOULDN'T CARE.

160
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,631
AND YOU HATE FISH.

161
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,434
THAT'S SO SWEET.

162
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:19,238
ALL RIGHT, OKAY, YOU CAN SEE.

163
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,440
THIS... IS ME.

164
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,443

165
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,746
OH, SORRY.

166
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,948
OH, I AM SCARY.

167
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,849
NO, THE LIGHTNING.

168
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,851
IT WAS AN UNFORTUNATE COINCIDENCE.

169
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,554
YOU LOOK LOVELY.

170
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:35,755
LOVELY.

171
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:36,956
I HATE THIS.

172
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,059
I HAD THE MOST AMAZING TWO WEEKS PLANNED FOR US.

173
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,061
AND ALMOST EVERYTHING I HAD IN MIND

174
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,464
WE HAD TO BE A LOT CLOSER THAN THIS.

175
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,967
PHOEBE, I HAVE SPENT THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS

176
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,969
IN A STEEL TUBE WITH MEN...

177
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,673
THINKING ABOUT THIS MOMENT.

178
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:59,278
I AM NOT GOING TO LET A BUNCH OF ITCHY SPOTS STAND BETWEEN US.

179
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,088
OKAY, THIS IS THE MOST ROMANTIC DISEASE

180
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,289
I'VE EVER HAD.

181
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,696
HEY.

182
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,297
HEY. HOW'S THE FIRST DAY GOING?

183
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,499
PRETTY GOOD. IT'S LIKE YOU SAID--

184
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,901
IT'S MOSTLY JUST PUTTING NUMBERS FROM ONE COLUMN

185
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,102
INTO ANOTHER COLUMN.

186
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:23,903
WELL, THERE YOU GO.

187
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,605
HEY, EVERYBODY IS SO NICE.

188
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,808
I HAD A GOOD TALK WITH THAT LADY WITH THE RED HAIR, JEANNIE.

189
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:32,712
JEANNIE, THE HEAD OF EAST COAST OPERATIONS JEANNIE?

190
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,815
YEAH. TURNS OUT OUR KIDS GO TO THE SAME SCHOOL.

191
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,820
SMALL WORLD, HUH?

192
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,923
WEIRD WORLD.

193
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,124
YOUR KIDS?

194
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,026
I FIGURE MY CHARACTER HAS KIDS.

195
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:51,030
YOU KNOW, THERE ISN'T A PART OF THAT SENTENCE

196
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,632
THAT I DON'T NEED EXPLAINED.

197
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,433
WELL, SEE, WHEN YOU'RE ACTING

198
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,836
YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT.

199
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,238
MY CHARACTER-- JOSEPH THE PROCESSING GUY--

200
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,140
HAS TWO LITTLE GIRLS

201
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,343
ASHLEY AND BRITTANY.

202
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,547
ASHLEY COPIES EVERYTHING BRITTANY DOES.

203
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,455
OH, WELL, INVISIBLE KIDS CAN BE THAT WAY SOMETIMES.

204
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,458
YOU KNOW, JOSEPH AND HIS WIFE, KAREN

205
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,261
ARE THINKING OF HAVING A THIRD KID.

206
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,263
YOU KNOW WHAT?

207
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,265
JUST DID.

208
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,567
REALLY? WOW.

209
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,969
THAT'S SOME PRETTY POWERFUL IMAGINARY SPERM

210
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,170
YOU MUST HAVE THERE.

211
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,384
YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES THE ITCHING EVEN WORSE?

212
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,688
THAT YOU DON'T STOP TALKING ABOUT IT?

213
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:49,889
FINE.

214
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,490
LET'S JUST PLAY, OKAY?

215
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,092
GOOD. OKAY.

216
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,895
HERE WE GO, DOUBLE SIXES.

217
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,698
HERE WE GO.

218
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,800
HERE WE GO.

219
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,001
COME TO MAMA.

220
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,403
GETTING READY TO ROLL THE DICE.

221
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:05,605
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

222
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,806
ARE YOU SCRATCHING?

223
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,809
NO. THIS IS WHAT I DO FOR LUCK, OKAY?

224
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,210
YOU'RE SCRATCHING.

225
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,411
GIVE ME THE DICE.

226
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:13,613
NO!

227
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,214
GIVE ME THE DICE!

228
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,415
NO! HERE! THERE!

229
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,917
OOH! DOUBLE SIXES!

230
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,518
WE CAN'T SCRATCH.

231
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,720
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T.

232
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,921
WE'LL SCAR.

233
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,323
I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT IT.

234
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,925
IT'S JUST SO HARD.

235
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,927
I JUST WANT TO GRAB ALL THESE HOUSES

236
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,929
AND RUB THEM ALL OVER MY BODY.

237
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:30,730
NO!

238
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,931
YES.

239
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:32,732
COME ON!

240
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,333
YOU KNOW YOU WANT IT.

241
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,935
YOU KNOW YOU WANT IT, TOO.

242
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,136
LET'S JUST BE BAD.

243
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:37,937
IT'LL FEEL SO GOOD.

244
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,138
OH, COME ON.

245
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,339
COME ON.

246
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,141
OH, GOD, HELP ME.

247
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,342
UH HUH.

248
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,443
GOOD, HUH?

249
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,045
OH, YEAH.

250
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,246
NOW DO ME.

251
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,748
DO MY BACK.

252
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:49,949
OH, COME ON, HARDER.

253
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,550
THERE YOU GO.

254
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,351
DON'T MOVE.

255
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,953
WHY? WHY?

256
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,355
OH! OH!

257
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,758

258
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,360
 STOP THAT! STOP THAT RIGHT NOW!

259
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,163
YOU KNOW, I MIGHT OF EXPECTED THIS OF YOU, PHOEBE

260
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,765
BUT, RYAN, YOU'RE A MILITARY MAN.

261
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:09,769
SHE MADE ME DO IT.

262
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,772
THAT'S A NICE COLOR ON YOU.

263
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,974
YEAH? WELL, IT COMES IN PINK AND BLOTCHY, BABY.

264
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:18,577
I HOPE YOU GET A WEENIE POCK.

265
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,480

266
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,684
YOU AND MILTON HAVE TO JOIN US ON THE BOAT.

267
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,285
KAREN'LL PACK A LUNCH.

268
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,887
YOU'LL BRING THE KIDS.

269
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,488
WE'LL MAKE A DAY OF IT.

270
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,090
WE'LL HAVE TO SET THAT UP.

271
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,692
OH, I BETTER GET BACK.

272
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,293
HOPE THE BABY FEELS BETTER.

273
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,494
OH, THANKS. THANKS.

274
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:36,696
BYE BYE, JEANNIE.

275
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,297
BYE BYE, JOSEPH.

276
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,700
WHAT A PHONY.

277
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,903
WELL, I'M SURE YOU'LL TEACH HER A LESSON

278
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,706
WHEN SHE STEPS OFF THE DOCK ONTO NOTHING.

279
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,508
HEY, MR. DOUGLAS.

280
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,110
LISTEN, BING, I RECEIVED YOUR MEMO.

281
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,512
SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THE SYSTEMS REPORT

282
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:54,714
UNTIL NEXT FRIDAY?

283
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,915
MY GROUP WANT TO SPEND

284
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,516
THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND WITH THEIR FAMILIES.

285
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,118
I HAVE A FAMILY.

286
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,319
I'M GOING TO BE HERE.

287
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,122
YEAH, BING, WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

288
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,327
IT'S ABOUT CUTTING MY PEOPLE A LITTLE SLACK

289
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,528
YOU KNOW, FOR MORALE.

290
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,931
LOOK, IF YOU WANT TO SEE SOME ROUGH NUMBERS

291
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,333
I CAN GET THEM TO YOU BY WEDNESDAY.

292
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,736
"ROUGH NUMBERS"?

293
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,538
THIS COMPANY WAS NOT BUILT ON ROUGH NUMBERS.

294
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,540
AM I RIGHT, MR. DOUGLAS?

295
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,744
HAVE THE FINAL NUMBERS ON MY DESK BY TUESDAY.

296
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,746
IF YOU SAY SO, SIR.

297
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,947

298
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,949
JOSEPH'S GOOD, ISN'T HE?

299
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,953
WELL, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU.

300
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,154
HEY, HEY.

301
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,957
I JUST FIGURED JOSEPH'S THE KIND OF GUY

302
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,558
WHO LIKES TO MIX IT UP

303
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:42,762
YOU KNOW, GET IN THERE, RUFFLE SOME FEATHERS.

304
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,564
WHY?

305
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:49,568
LOOK, I'M SORRY, BUT THAT'S WHAT JOSEPH DOES.

306
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,170
OKAY?

307
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,172
IF YOU TRY TO PULL SOMETHING

308
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,574
HE'LL CALL YOU ON IT.

309
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,176
"WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL?"

310
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,377
HE'LL SAY.

311
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,283
OOH, DUCT TAPE.

312
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,086
WAS I SUPPOSED TO BRING SOMETHING, TOO?

313
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,588
THIS IS FOR THE SCRATCHY TWINS OUT THERE.

314
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,391
I TAPED OVEN MITTS TO THEIR HANDS.

315
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,994
YOU'RE STRICT.

316
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,996
YEAH, WELL, IT'S FOR THEIR OWN GOOD.

317
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,597
YOU KNOW, I LIKE

318
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:22,201
THE WAY YOU HAVE EFFICIENTLY FOLDED THIS TAB UNDER.

319
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,803
SEE, IN A TAPE EMERGENCY

320
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,205
YOU COULD SHAVE VALUABLE SECONDS OFF YOUR TIME.

321
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,607
EXACTLY.

322
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:29,809
OH.

323
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,813
I LOVE THAT I CAN BE TOTALLY NEUROTIC AROUND YOU NOW.

324
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,014
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

325
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,615
DON'T YOU LIKE IT BETTER

326
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:39,418
NOW THAT EVERYTHING ON YOUR DESK IS PERPENDICULAR?

327
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:42,621
IT IT'S NOT A RIGHT ANGLE, IT IS A WRONG ANGLE.

328
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:43,823
VERY GOOD.

329
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,623
THANK YOU.

330
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:45,825
YOU KNOW WHAT?

331
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,827
TOMORROW, I'M GOING TO DO YOUR CLOCKS.

332
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,629
YOU'RE GOING TO DO WHAT TO MY CLOCKS?

333
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,331
I'M GOING TO SET THEM TO MY TIME.

334
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,634
WELL, I'M CONFUSED.

335
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,437
I THOUGHT WE SHARED TIME.

336
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,439
NO, NO.

337
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,242
SEE, IN MY BEDROOM, I SET MY CLOCK SIX MINUTES FAST.

338
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,844
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?

339
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,646
BECAUSE IT'S IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TIME ZONE

340
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:08,848
THAN THE KITCHEN?

341
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,449
YOU KNOW WHAT? FORGET IT.

342
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,051
NO, COME ON, TELL ME.

343
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,053
NO, BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

344
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:14,854
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY

345
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,856
OF THESE CUTE LITTLE OBSESSIVE THINGS.

346
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,858
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE. THAT IS NOT TRUE.

347
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,860
OH, YEAH? WELL, TELL ME ONE OF YOURS.

348
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,461
OKAY.

349
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,266
AH!

350
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,868
ONE OF MY THINGS IS

351
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:34,874
I ALWAYS SEPARATE MY SWEAT SOCKS FROM MY DRESS SOCKS.

352
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:36,876
YEAH.

353
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,878
WHAT IF THEY GET MIXED UP?

354
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,280
BOY, I WOULD JUST, UH...

355
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,083
I WOULD FREAK OUT.

356
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,686
YOU WOULD NOT.

357
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:48,888
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

358
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,489
I HATE THIS.

359
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,690
YOU'RE TOO NORMAL.

360
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,493
CAN'T BELIEVE MY BOYFRIEND DOESN'T HAVE A THING.

361
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,495
MY BOYFRIEND DOESN'T HAVE A THING.

362
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,899
SEE, IF ANYONE OVERHEARD THAT, I DIDN'T COME OFF WELL THERE.

363
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,606
HEY!

364
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,809
MR. DOUGLAS IS LOOKING FOR YOU.

365
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,211
WHY? W W WHY?

366
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,812
WHY IS MR. DOUGLAS LOOKING FOR ME?

367
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,414
BECAUSE HE HAS A STRONG SUSPICION

368
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,217
THAT YOU DROPPED THE BALL ON THE LENDER PROJECT.

369
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,818
WHAT... W WHY...

370
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,820
WHY DOES HE SUSPECT THAT?

371
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,623
BECAUSE, AT FIRST, HE THOUGHT IT WAS JOSEPH.

372
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,625
BUT AFTER HE ASKED JOSEPH ABOUT IT

373
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,627
TURNS OUT IT WAS YOU.

374
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,729
ANYWAY, I JUST THOUGHT

375
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,031
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

376
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,533
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT!

377
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,135
LOOK, JOEY, I'M SORRY.

378
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,938
I REALIZE THIS IS THE ROLE OF A LIFETIME FOR YOU

379
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,240
AND IF I COULD JUST FIRE JOSEPH, I WOULD

380
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,441
BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

381
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,244
SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO LET BOTH OF YOU GO.

382
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,845
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

383
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,248
EVERYBODY LOVES JOSEPH.

384
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,449
I DON'T.

385
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,650
I HATE JOSEPH.

386
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,851
OKAY?

387
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,254
I THINK HE'S A BROWN NOSING SUCK UP.

388
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,455
OH, YEAH?

389
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,656
WELL, YOU CAN'T FIRE JOSEPH.

390
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:58,857
YOU KNOW WHY?

391
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,859
BECAUSE HE'S NOT IN YOUR DEPARTMENT.

392
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,263
HAA.

393
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,365
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

394
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,168
ALL RIGHT, SO I CAN'T FIRE JOSEPH

395
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,570
BUT I CAN SLEEP WITH HIS WIFE.

396
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,975
NOT KAREN?

397
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,176
YEAH, KAREN.

398
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,578
I'M THINKING ABOUT HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH HER.

399
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:20,779
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

400
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,381
I JUST DID.

401
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,184

402
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,987
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING TO ME, MAN?

403
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,588
OH. WELL, IT'S NOT ME.

404
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:30,789
IT'S MY CHARACTER.

405
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,791
"CHANDY."

406
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,892
THE ROGUE PROCESSOR

407
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:37,496
WHO SEDUCES HIS COWORKERS' WIVES FOR SPORT

408
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,697
AND LAUGHS ABOUT IT

409
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:39,898
THE NEXT DAY AT THE WATER COOLER.

410
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:42,301
IN FACT, I HAVE HER PANTIES RIGHT THERE IN MY DRAWER.

411
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,203
REALLY?

412
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,205
NO, FREAK SHOW! SHE'S FICTIONAL!

413
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,206
ALL RIGHT!

414
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,407
HEY, TAKE IT EASY.

415
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,409
IF IT MEANS THAT MUCH TO YOU

416
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,612
I'LL, UH... I'LL GO FIND SOMETHING ELSE.

417
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,514
THANK YOU.

418
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,717
IT'S JUST THAT...

419
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,820
I'M GOING TO MISS JOSEPH.

420
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,422
I LIKED HIM.

421
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,424
HIS WIFE... SHE WAS HOT.

422
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,227
AND THE KIDS...

423
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,428
YOU KNOW, HE WAS GOING

424
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,430
TO PUT IN A POOL NEXT SUMMER.

425
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:13,832
OW!

426
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,336
CAN I PLEASE TAKE THESE OFF?

427
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,937
I SWEAR I WON'T SCRATCH.

428
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:19,938
SORRY, HON.

429
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,540
MONICA'S ORDERS.

430
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,443
WELL, THAT WASN'T EASY.

431
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,047
OKAY, DINNER'S ON.

432
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,250
AND THERE'S A PEACH COBBLER WARMING IN THE OVEN.

433
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,252
SO THE PLATE'S GOING TO BE HOT

434
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,654
BUT THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM FOR YOU.

435
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,256

436
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,457
ALL RIGHT, YOU KIDS.

437
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,658
BYE, NOW.

438
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:40,559
BYE.

439
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,760
 LOOK.

440
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,762
A LOW BUDGET PUPPET SHOW.

441
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:44,963
IT'S SUCH A SHAME

442
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,766
YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT FINGER I'M HOLDING UP.

443
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,368
ALL RIGHT.

444
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,772
WINE?

445
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:54,973
PLEASE.

446
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,684
WHOOP. SPILLED SOME.

447
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:06,885
I GOT IT.

448
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,698
I MUST TELL YOU.

449
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,300
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL TONIGHT.

450
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,901
WHAT?

451
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,504
SORRY.

452
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,109
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

453
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,310
OH.

454
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,726
YOU KNOW WHAT?

455
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,328
THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.

456
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,336
OH.

457
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,537
OH, YES.

458
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,339
OH. OH.

459
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,540
GOOD.

460
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,343

461
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,544
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?

462
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,146

463
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,947
HEY, YOU GUYS. DID YOU...?

464
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,659
MONICA, WAKE UP.

465
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,860
MONICA.

466
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,462
WHAT'S UP?

467
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,063
I THOUGHT OF A THING.

468
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,269
YEAH?

469
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,470
YEAH.

470
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,474
I HAVE TO SLEEP-- HAVE TO-- ON THIS SIDE OF THE BED.

471
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,077
NO, HONEY.

472
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,480
YOU HAVE TO SLEEP ON THIS SIDE OF THE BED

473
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,283
BECAUSE I HAVE TO SLEEP ON THIS SIDE OF THE BED.

474
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:49,087
OR SO I WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE.

475
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,089
OH....

476
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,291
BIG DEAL.

477
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,293
SO YOU HAVE A SIDE OF THE BED.

478
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,295
EVERYBODY HAS A SIDE OF THE BED.

479
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,095
HEY, COME ON.

480
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,097
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD MY REASON YET.

481
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,099
ALL RIGHT, GO ON.

482
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:04,703
OKAY. I HAVE TO SLEEP ON THE WEST SIDE

483
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,307
BECAUSE I GREW UP IN CALIFORNIA

484
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:13,912
AND OTHERWISE THE OCEAN WOULD BE ON THE WRONG SIDE.

485
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,518
OH, MY GOD.

486
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,119
YOU'RE A FREAK.

487
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,321
YEAH.

488
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,922
HOW ABOUT THAT?

489
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,729
SO, RYAN, WHERE YOU SHIPPING OFF TO?

490
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,831
I REALLY CAN'T SAY.

491
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,533
DO YOU HAVE ANY NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON BOARD?

492
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,435
I CAN'T SAY.

493
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,538
DO YOU GET TO LOOK THROUGH ONE OF THOSE PERISCOPE THINGIES?

494
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,740
I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T SAY.

495
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,643
WOW. IT'S NEAT LEARNING ABOUT SUBMARINES.

496
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,144
I BETTER GET OUT OF HERE.

497
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,746
I'M GOING TO MISS MY FLIGHT.

498
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,947
I'LL WALK YOU OUT.

499
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:50,148
PLEASURE.

500
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:51,350
TAKE CARE.

501
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:59,358
SO, DO YOU, UH, THINK WE COULD GET YOU

502
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,160
ONE OF THOSE, UH, UNIFORM THINGS?

503
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,162
YOU LIKE THAT, DO YOU?

504
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,364
OH, YEAH.

505
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,565
I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS.

506
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:07,766
OKAY.

507
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:10,369
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS IS HOW

508
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,970
WE SPENT OUR TWO WEEKS TOGETHER?

509
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,273
WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF THE ROMANTIC THINGS

510
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,075
I HAD PLANNED, LIKE HAVING A PICNIC IN CENTRAL PARK

511
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,677
AND COFFEE AT CENTRAL PERK.

512
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,379
OH, I JUST GOT THAT.

513
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,980
OH.

514
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,289
TAXI.

515
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,497
BYE, YOU.

516
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,902

517
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,612
OH, I'M SORRY. WE'RE CLO...

518
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:57,916
HEY, SAILOR.

519
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,918
IS THIS WHAT YOU HAD IN MIND?

520
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:00,919

521
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,120
I'LL SAY.

522
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:07,326

523
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,128
I'M SHIPPING OUT TOMORROW.

524
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,130
WELL, THEN, UH...

525
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,134
WE BETTER MAKE THIS NIGHT COUNT.

526
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,438
OH, WAIT.

527
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,840
I FORGOT TO TURN OFF THE CAPPUCCINO MACHINE.

528
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,041
SORRY.

529
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:23,842
OH.

530
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,049
ANCHORS AWAY.

531
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,852

532
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,854
OH, AND MY PURSE, MY PURSE.

533
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,856
MY PURSE, MY PURSE.

534
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,057
SORRY. OOH.

535
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:41,860
THANK YOU.

536
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,462
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

537
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,063
I FORGOT TO TURN OFF THE BATHROOM LIGHT.

538
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:47,666
WHY DON'T I JUST MEET YOU UPSTAIRS?

540
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,373
HONEY...!
