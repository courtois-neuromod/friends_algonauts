1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,605

2
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:08,008
MAN, I SURE MISS JULIE.

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,810
SPANISH MIDGETS...

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,613
SPANISH MIDGETS WRESTLING...

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,217
JULIE. OKAY, YES, I SEE HOW YOU GOT THERE.

6
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,619

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,322

8
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:25,125
YOU EVER FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT THING'S FOR?

9
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,127
I'M TRYING THIS NEW SCREENING THING.

10
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,529
I FIGURE IF I'M ALWAYS ANSWERING THE PHONE

11
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,531
PEOPLE WILL THINK I DON'T HAVE A LIFE.

12
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,533
MY GOD, RODRIGO NEVER GETS PINNED.

13
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,135
 Here comes the beep.

14
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,736
You know what to do.

15
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:37,537

16
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,939
 Hello. I'm looking for Bob.

17
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,141
This is Jade.

18
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,543
I don't know if you're still at this number

19
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,346
but I was just thinking about us and how great it was

20
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,348
and, well, I know it's been three years

21
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,951
but I was kind of hoping we could hook up again, you know?

22
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,354
I barely had the nerve to make this call

23
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:55,955
so you know what I did?

24
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:57,957
WHAT?

25
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:00,360
I got a little drunk... and naked.

40
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:54,314
SO, UH... WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?

41
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,716
Oh, you know, the usual:

42
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,318
teaching aerobics

43
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,220
partying way too much.

44
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,423
Oh, and in case you were wondering

45
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:07,327
those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.

46
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:11,030
CAN YOU HOLD ON A MOMENT?

47
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,232
I HAVE ANOTHER CALL.

48
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,833
I LOVE HER.

49
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,034
I KNOW.

50
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,236
I'M BACK.

51
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,439
So are we going to get together or what?

52
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,640
UM, ABSOLUTELY.

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,742
UH, HOW ABOUT TOMORROW AFTERNOON?

54
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,545
YOU KNOW CENTRAL PERK IN THE VILLAGE, SAY FIVE ISH?

55
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,547
Great. I'll see you then.

56
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:28,748
OKAY.

57
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,551
OKAY.

58
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,754
HAVING A PHONE HAS FINALLY PAID OFF.

59
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:38,258
OKAY, EVEN THOUGH YOU DO DO A GOOD BOB IMPRESSION

60
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,860
I'M THINKING WHEN SHE SEES YOU TOMORROW

61
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,063
SHE MAY REALIZE THAT, "HEY, YOU'RE NOT BOB."

62
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,166
AW, YOU SEE, TATTOO

63
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,969
MISS JADE'S FANTASY IS TO REKINDLE THE LOVE

64
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,971
SHE ONCE HAD WITH BOB.

65
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,072
YOU KNOW WHAT MY FANTASY IS?

66
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,674
THAT YOU TALK LIKE A NORMAL PERSON.

67
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,676
I AM HOPING THAT WHEN BOB

68
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,579
DOESN'T SHOW UP, SHE WILL SEEK COMFORT

69
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,382
IN THE OPEN ARMS OF THE WRY STRANGER

70
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,583
AT THE NEXT TABLE.

71
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:04,984
OH, MY GOD.

72
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,586
YOU ARE PURE EVIL.

73
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,589
OKAY, PURE EVIL.

74
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,191
HORNY AND ALONE.

75
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,396
I'VE DONE THIS.

76
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,003
YEAH, YEAH, EVERYBODY'S HERE.

77
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:27,207
HEY, EVERYBODY, SAY HI TO JULIE IN NEW MEXICO.

78
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,209
HI. HI, JULIE.

79
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,810
HI, JULIE.

80
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,011

81
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,013
OKAY, WHILE ROSS IS ON THE PHONE

82
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,416
EVERYBODY OWES ME 62 BUCKS FOR HIS BIRTHDAY.

83
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,817
UM...

84
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:41,020

88
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,934
LOOK, GUYS, I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE STEEP.

89
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,337
YEAH, WHOOSH!

90
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:00,139

YOU KNOW, I THINK I MIGHT JUST.

101
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:21,361
SO, UH, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING FOR DINNER TONIGHT?

102

SO I GUESS I'LL JUST STAY HOME AND EAT DUST BUNNIES.

105
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,472

106
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,675
DO YOU GUYS EVER GET THE FEELING THAT, UM...

I CAN NEVER GET A GIRL LIKE THAT

144
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,257
WITH CONVENTIONAL METHODS.

145
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,859
THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

146
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,461
SHE WANTED TO CALL BOB.

BOB IS WHO SHE WAS MEANT TO BE WITH.

00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:08,267
YOU MAY BE DESTROYING TWO PEOPLE'S CHANCE FOR HAPPINESS.

150
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,869
WE DON'T KNOW BOB.

151
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,471

167
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,112
BUT THAT'S ME.

168
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,313

00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,698
I DON'T KNOW, CHANDLER.

00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:20,900
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

337
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,902

WE SWITCHED MEAT SUPPLIERS AT WORK

343
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,215

00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,817
BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE.

345
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,619
HEY, CHANDLER, WHAT IS IN THAT ENVELOPE?

346
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:44,623

CHARITY?

359
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,158

00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,963
YOUR NICE THING MAKES US FEEL ABOUT THIS BIG.

362
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,765
ACTUALLY, IT MAKES US FEEL THAT BIG.

363
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,767
WHAT? I DON'T... I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

364
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:29,969
I MEAN, YOU..

365
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,971
IT'S LIKE WE CAN'T WIN WITH YOU GUYS.

366
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,373
YEAH, IF YOU GUYS FEEL THIS BIG

367
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,975
MAYBE THAT'S NOT OUR FAULT.

368
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,977
MAYBE THAT'S JUST... HOW YOU FEEL.

369
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:42,581
OH... NOW YOU'RE TELLING US HOW WE FEEL.

370
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,984
OKAY, WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

371
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,786
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO PASS ON THE CONCERT

372
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,990
BECAUSE I'M JUST NOT IN A VERY HOOTIE PLACE RIGHT NOW.

373
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,094

374
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:55,895

375
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,397

376
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,799
THEN YOU'LL HAVE EXTRA SEATS, YOU KNOW

377
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,401
FOR ALL YOUR TIARAS AND STUFF.

378
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,803
WHY DID YOU LOOK AT ME WHEN YOU SAID THAT?

379
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,011
SO, I GUESS NOW WE CAN'T GO.

380
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,313
COME ON, YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

381
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,715
WE ALWAYS HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING TOGETHER?

382
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,117
YOU KNOW WHAT?

383
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,718
YOU'RE RIGHT.

384
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:20,319
FINE.

385
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,520
FINE.

386
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,421
FINE!

387
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,222
FINE.

388
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,123
FINE.

389
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,324
ALL RIGHT.

390
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:27,826
WE'RE GOING TO GO.

391
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,234
IT'S NOT FOR ANOTHER SIX HOURS.

392
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,435
WE'RE GOING TO GO THEN.

393
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,744
CHANDLER?

394
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:46,845
YEAH?

395
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,847
OH, GEEZ... OH... ARE YOU READY?

396
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,049
YES. LET ME GRAB

397
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,051
MY JACKET AND TELL YOU I HAD SEX TODAY.

398
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,652
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

399
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:57,856
WHAT? YOU... YOU HAD SEX TODAY?

400
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:01,260
WOW, IT SOUNDS EVEN COOLER WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE SAYS IT.

401
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,662
I WAS AWESOME, OKAY?

402
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,865
SHE WAS BITING HER LIP TO STOP FROM SCREAMING.

403
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,467
WOW.

404
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,268
NOW, I KNOW IT'S BEEN A WHILE

405
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:10,869
BUT I TOOK THAT AS A GOOD SIGN.

406
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:15,474

407
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,877
STILL DOING THE SCREENING THING?

408
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,679
I HAD SEX TODAY.

409
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:24,283
I NEVER HAVE TO ANSWER THAT PHONE AGAIN.

410
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,885
 Here comes the beep. You know what to do.

411
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:27,686

412
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,288
Hey, Bob, it's Jade.

413
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,890
Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt

414
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,492
when you didn't show up

415
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,194
the other day

416
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,997
and, just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.

417
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,598
BOB HERE.

418
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:40,799
Oh, hi.

419
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,803
SO, UH, YOU MET SOMEONE, HUH?

420
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,705
Yes. Yes, I did.

421
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,908
In fact, I had sex with him two hours ago.

422
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,711
SO, UH...

423
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,313
HOW WAS HE?

424
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,914
Eh.

425
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,224
"EH?"

426
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,827
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you.

427
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:16,835
I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.

428
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:20,439
WELL, THAT MAKES ME FEEL SO GOOD.

429
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,642
It was just so awkward and bumpy.

430
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,044

431
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,946
WELL, MAYBE HE HAD SOME KIND OF NEW, UH, COOL STYLE

432
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,948
THAT YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH

433
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,151
AND MAYBE YOU HAVE TO GET USED TO IT.

434
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,553
There really wasn't much time to get used to it

435
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,754
if you know what I mean.

436
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,366
YOU KNOW WHAT?

437
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,768
I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO ENJOY THIS.

438
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:50,869
YEAH, I KNOW.

439
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,071
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

440
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,672
WE ALL SHOULD BE HERE.

441
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,075
SO, LET'S GO.

442
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,083
WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD STAY FOR ONE SONG.

443
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,684
YEAH. I MEAN, IT'D BE RUDE TO THEM

444
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,286
FOR US TO LEAVE NOW.

445
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,688
THE OTHER GUYS ARE PROBABLY HAVING A GREAT TIME.

446
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:16,095
COME ON, YOU GUYS, ONE MORE TIME.

447
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,296
OKAY.

448
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,497
ONE.

449
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,099
NO.

450
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:29,708
THAT WAS AMAZING!

451
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,310
EXCELLENT! THAT WAS EXCELLENT.

452
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,412
I CAN'T BELIEVE THE GUYS MISSED THIS.

453
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,213
WHAT GUYS?

454
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,414
OH, YEAH.

455
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,616
EXCUSE ME.

456
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,618
YOU'RE MONICA GELLER, AREN'T YOU?

457
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,819
DO I KNOW YOU?

458
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,421
YOU USED TO BE MY BABY SITTER.

459
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,624
OH, MY GOD, LITTLE STEVIE FISHER?

460
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,425
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

461
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,127
GOOD. GOOD.

462
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,328
I'M A LAWYER NOW.

463
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,730
YOU CAN'T BE A LAWYER. YOU'RE EIGHT.

464
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,732
WELL, LISTEN, IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU.

465
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:54,933
I GOT TO RUN BACKSTAGE.

466
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,135
WAIT. BACKSTAGE?

467
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,137
OH, YEAH. MY FIRM REPRESENTS THE BAND.

468
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,139
ROSS. CHANDLER.

469
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,141
LOOK, YOU GUYS WANT

470
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,342
TO MEET THE GROUP?

471
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,543
YEAH, WE DO.

472
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,344
COME ON.

473
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,545
SO, LOOK, ARE YOU ONE OF THE ONES

474
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,547
THAT FOOLED AROUND WITH MY DAD?

475
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,754
HEY, YOU GUYS.

476
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:16,555
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

477
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:17,756
OH, THANK YOU.

478
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:18,957
THANKS.

479
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:23,562
SO, UH... HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT LAST NIGHT?

480
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,964
WELL, IT PRETTY MUCH SUCKED.

481
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,566
HOW WAS YOURS?

482
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:28,967
OURS PRETTY MUCH SUCKED, TOO.

483
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,969
BUT I DID RUN INTO LITTLE STEVIE FISHER.

484
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,171
DO YOU REMEMBER HIM?

485
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,173
OH, YEAH. I USED TO BABY SIT HIM.

486
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,175
HEY, HOW'S HIS DAD?

487
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,179
GOOD.

488
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,480
ASIDE FROM THAT

489
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,081
THE WHOLE EVENING WAS PRETTY MUCH A BUST.

490
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,884
YEAH, WE... WE REALLY MISSED YOU GUYS.

491
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,287
YEAH, LOOK, UH... WE WERE JUST SAYING

492
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,289
THIS WHOLE THING IS SO STUPID.

493
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:54,293
WE JUST HAVE TO REALLY, REALLY, REALLY NOT LET STUFF LIKE THIS

494
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,894
ABOUT MONEY GET, LIKE...

495
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,095
IS THAT A HICKEY?

496
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:03,101
OH, NO, I JUST... I FELL DOWN.

497
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,406
ON SOMEONE'S LIPS?

498
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,408
WHERE'D YOU GET THE HICKEY?

499
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,610
YOU KNOW, A PARTY OR...

500
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,811
WHAT PARTY?

501
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,513
WELL, IT WASN'T A PARTY

502
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,316
SO MUCH AS A... A GATHERING OF PEOPLE...

503
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:23,021
...WITH FOOD AND MUSIC AND... AND... AND THE BAND.

504
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:26,225
YOU PARTIED WITH HOOTIE AND THE BLOWFISH?

505
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,828
YES, APPARENTLY, STEVIE AND HOOTIE ARE LIKE THIS.

506
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,831
WHO GAVE YOU THAT HICKEY?

507
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,634
THAT WOULD BE THE WORK OF A BLOWFISH.

508
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,339
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

509
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,940
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

510
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,542
WE'RE JUST, LIKE, SITTING AT HOME

511
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:46,345
JUST TRYING TO GUESS JOEY'S FINGERS, AND...

512
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,747
AND YOU GUYS ARE OUT

513
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,749
LIKE, PARTYING AND HAVING FUN

514
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,952
AND, YOU KNOW, ALL "HEY, BLOWFISH, SUCK ON MY NECK."

515
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,457
HEY, LOOK, DON'T BLAME US.

516
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,459
YOU GUYS COULD HAVE BEEN THERE, YOU KNOW.

517
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,660
OH, WHAT?

518
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,463
AS PART OF YOUR POOR FRIENDS OUTREACH PROGRAM?

519
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,564

520
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:06,765
GREAT. IT'S WORK.

521
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,166
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

522
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,168
I'M SORRY THAT WE MAKE MORE MONEY THAN YOU

523
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,571
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT.

524
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,772
WE WORK REALLY HARD FOR IT.

525
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,774
AND WE DON'T WORK HARD?

526
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,776
YEAH, HI. IT'S MONICA. I JUST GOT A PAGE.

527
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,978
I'M JUST SAYING THAT SOMETIMES WE LIKE TO DO STUFF

528
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,179
THAT COSTS A LITTLE MORE.

529
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,181
OH, AND YOU FEEL LIKE WE HOLD YOU BACK?

530
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:23,982
YES.

531
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:24,783

532
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,286
NO.

533
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,088

534
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:30,989
LEON, LEON, WAIT.

535
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,591
SHH! GUYS.

536
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,293
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

537
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,095
THOSE STEAKS WERE JUST A GIFT FROM THE MEAT VENDOR.

538
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,697
THAT WAS NOT A KICKBACK.

539
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,499
I MEAN, COME ON, I'LL JUST REPLACE THEM

540
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,501
AND WE CAN FORGET THE WHOLE THING.

541
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,605
WHAT CORPORATE POLICY?

542
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,308
NO...

543
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,412
YEAH.

544
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,013
OKAY.

545
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,220
I JUST GOT FIRED.

546
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,022
OH!

547
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,624
OH.

548
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:06,825
WHY?

549
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,628
HERE'S YOUR CHECK.

550
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,229
THAT'LL BE $4.12 DOLLAR.

551
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,831
LET ME GET THAT.

552
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,135
YOU GOT FIVE BUCKS?

553
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,744

554
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,346
 Here comes the beep.

555
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,547
You know what to do.

556
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,148

557
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:32,150
 Hi. It's me.

558
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,555
Listen, Bob, I'm... I'm probably way out of line here.

559
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,957
I mean, it has been three years

560
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,760
and you're probably seeing someone else now

561
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,162
but if we could just have one night together

562
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:50,268
just for old time's sake-- one hot, steamy, wild night.
