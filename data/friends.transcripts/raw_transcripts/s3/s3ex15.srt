00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,505
HEY, HOW MUCH YOU GIVE ME TO EAT THIS WHOLE JAR

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,007
OF OLIVES?

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,009
I WON'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,510
BUT YOU'LL OWE ME $2.95.

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,012
DONE.

6
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,015
HEY. I NEED AN ATLAS.

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,016
I NEED AN ATLAS.

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,017
WHY?

9
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,518
DO YOU HAVE A REPORT DUE?

10
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,021
I HAVE A DATE WITH THIS DIPLOMAT I MET

11
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,524
WHILE I WAS GIVING FREE MASSAGES OUTSIDE THE U.N.

12
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,027
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE HIS COUNTRY IS.

13
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,530
OKAY, LET'S START WITH THE FREE MASSAGES AT THE U.N.

14
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,032
OH, IT'S MY NEW THING.

15
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,534
I FIGURE, "BODIES AT PEACE MAKE PEACE."

16
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,036
WOW. YOU MIGHT JUST GET

17
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,039
THE FIRST NOBEL PRIZE IN RUBBING.

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,541
SO WHAT COUNTRY IS THIS GUY FROM?

19
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,544
UM, ICHNECH... TRAIAN... ISTAN.

20
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,547
THERE'S A "G" IN THERE.

21
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,050
WHERE'S THAT?

22
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,551
IN YOUR ATLAS.

23
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,053
I DON'T HAVE AN ATLAS.

24
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,554
OH, WELL, WAIT.

25
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,056
I DO HAVE A GLOBE.

26
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,558
SO, PHEEBS, WHAT'S THIS GUY LIKE?

27
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,562
UM, WELL, HE'S VERY DASHING, YOU KNOW?

28
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,564
AND, UM, VERY, VERY SOPHISTICATED.

29
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,566
AND HE DOESN'T SPEAK ANY ENGLISH

30
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,069
BUT, ACCORDING TO HIS TRANSLATOR, HE TOTALLY GETS ME.

31
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,072
OKAY, HERE YOU GO.

32
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,074
WHAT IS THIS?

33
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,577
IT'S A GLOBE...

34
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,579
AND A PENCIL SHARPENER.

35
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,084
PEOPLE OF EARTH, SURRENDER.

36
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,589
GIANT ALIENS...

37
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,092
FIVE TINY HEADS.

38
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,095
HEY, ANYBODY NEED ANYTHING COPIED?

39
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,596
I'M GOING DOWN TO THE XEROX PLACE.

40
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,598
OH, NO, THANKS.

41
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,600
OKAY, LISTEN, JUST GIVE ME ANYTHING I CAN MAKE TWO OF.

42
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,102
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO COPY

43
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,603
WHY ARE YOU GOING DOWN THERE?

44
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,105
ARE YOU JUST GOING DOWN THERE

45
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,106
TO GAWK AT THAT HOT GIRL

46
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,108

47
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,610
YEAH. DO YOU WANT TO COME?

48
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,114
YEAH.

00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,167
FINISH UP WITH YOUR CUSTOMER FIRST.

64
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,668
COME ON, CHLOE.

65
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,170
COME ON, CHLOE.

66
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,171
CAN I HELP YOU?

67
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,172
UH OH.

68
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,673
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

69
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,676
WE'RE HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT OUR, UH, COPYING NEEDS

70
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,679
AND WE'LL NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT.

71
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,682
CHLOE, SWITCH WITH ME.

72
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,185
THERE ARE SOME GUYS HERE WHO GOT A CRUSH ON YOU.

73
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,189
OKAY, THAT HURT US.

74
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,691
HI, GUYS. I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE THIS MORNING.

75
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,694
WELL, UH...

76
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,198
YOU KNOW.

77
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,201
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING

78
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,702
TOMORROW NIGHT?

79
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,703
BOTH OF US?

80
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,706
MAYBE. DOES THAT SCARE YOU?

81
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,214
RELAX. JUST ISAAC'S DEEJAYING AT THE PHILLY.

82
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,215
YOU SHOULD COME.

83
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,716
OH, WE'LL BE THERE.

84
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,718
GREAT. I'LL, UH, SEE YOU THEN.

85
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,720
ALL RIGHT. ROCK ON.

86
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,732

87
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,735
HE SAYS THAT WALKING WITH YOU

88
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,238
MAKES THIS STRANGE CITY FEEL LIKE HOME.

89
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,740
OH. ME, TOO...

90
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,243
ALTHOUGH THIS CITY IS MY HOME, SO...

91
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,744
SO THAT'S DUMB, WHAT I SAID.

92
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,746
DON'T TELL HIM I SAID THAT.

93
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,249
JUST... YOU MAKE SOMETHING UP.

94
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:13,753

95
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:18,258

96
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,760
NICE. THANK YOU.

97
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,762
THIS IS ME, HERE.

98
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,766
UH...

99
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,771

100
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,276
"YOUR EYES ARE VERY PRETTY."

101
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,778
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

102
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,280
OH, THANK YOU.

103
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,291
HE WOULD LIKE TO KISS YOU.

104
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,297
OKAY, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT NOW.

105
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,298
OH, NO, NO, NO.

106
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,799
NOT HIM. NO, YOU DON'T.

107
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,801
OH.

108
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,806
OKAY, WELL, THE MOMENT'S OVER.

109
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,816
OH.

110
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,819
"OY."

111
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,323
SEE, THERE IT IS, RIGHT THERE.

112
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,825
WOW. IT'S SMALL.

113
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,327
YEAH, BUT SERGEI SAID

114
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,829
IT TOOK THE GERMANS SIX WEEKS

115
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,831
TO GET ALL THE WAY ACROSS IT.

116
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,333
SO YOU HAD FUN, HUH?

117
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,334
YEAH. EXCEPT FOR...

118
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,336
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE ON A DATE

119
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,338
AND YOU'RE GETTING ALONG REALLY GREAT

120
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,341
BUT THE GUY'S TRANSLATOR KEEPS GETTING IN THE WAY?

121
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,842
NO.

122
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,345
HEY.

123
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,846

124
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,348
OH, NO, SHE'S STILL AT WORK

125
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,850
BUT SHE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU TO CALL HER.

126
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,851
OH, WHAT?

127
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,353
IS SHE GOING TO CANCEL ON ME AGAIN?

128
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,354
HOW COULD SHE DO THIS?

129
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,356
DOESN'T SHE KNOW IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY?

130
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,357
ALL RIGHT, ROSS.

131
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,360
THIS IS THE EXTENT OF MY KNOWLEDGE ON THE SUBJECT.

132
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,361
"CALL RACHEL."

133
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,863
WHAT'S THAT ON THE BOTTOM?

134
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,867
OH, THAT'S MY DOODLE OF A LADYBUG WITH A TOP HAT.

135
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,369
SHE'S FANCY.

136
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,872

137
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,873
HELLO.

138
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,874
Hey, honey.

139
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,875
OH, HI.

00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,377
HEY, WHAT'S...? HOW'S IT GOING?

141
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,879
WELL, KIND OF HAVING AN UNDERWEAR EMERGENCY.

142
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,381
OH, YEAH? WHAT HAPPENED?

143
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,883
SOMEONE SCARE YOU AND MAKE YOU LAUGH TOO HARD?

144
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,385
THERE WAS A DISASTER IN SHIPPING

145
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,387
AND NOW I'VE GOT TO GET THIS ORDER IN.

146
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,888
HONEY, I'M SO SORRY

147
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,390

148
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,891
WHAT, DO YOU...? WELL, UM...

149
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,393
OH, HOW ABOUT I COME UP THERE?

150
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,894
NO, NO, NO, NO. HONEY, PLEASE.

151
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,397
I'VE GOT... I JUST HAVE TOO MUCH TO DEAL WITH.

152
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,900
ANYWAY, I'M GOING OUT WITH SERGEI AGAIN TONIGHT.

153
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,902
COULD YOU COME AND BE THE TRANSLATOR'S DATE

154
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,404
SO THAT WHEN WE--

155
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,406
YOU KNOW, IT'S TIME FOR OUR ALONE TIME--

156
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,408
YOU TWO CAN SPLIT OFF?

157
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,410
YOU KNOW, HE'S RE... HE'S KIND OF CUTE.

158
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,412
"KIND OF CUTE" LIKE REALLY" KIND OF CUTE"

159
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,415
OR "KIND OF CUTE" LIKE YOUR FRIEND "SPACKLE BACK" LARRY?

160
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,916
HEY, DON'T CALL HIM THAT.

161
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,419
HIS NAME IS SPACKLE BACKHARRY.

162
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,925
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE WE SHOULD GET GOING.

163
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,927
WHAT TIME DID CHLOE SAY WE SHOULD GET THERE?

164
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:08,928
UH, 10:30.

165
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,430
WHAT TIME IS IT NOW?

166
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,432
4:30.

167
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,934
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, SO WE'LL HANG OUT.

168
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,936
YEAH.

169
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,941
HEY, REMEMBER WHEN SHE BROUGHT UP THAT THING ABOUT--

170
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,443
YOU KNOW, THE THREE OF US?

171
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,446
YES. VIVIDLY.

172
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,947
SHE WAS KIDDING ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?

173
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,949
YEAH, I THINK SO.

174
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,456
YEAH, I THINK SO.

175
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,958
GOD, IT WOULD BE WEIRD IF THAT SITUATION

176
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,460
PRESENTED ITSELF TONIGHT, HUH?

177
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,461
OH, YEAH.

178
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,964
YEAH, I MEAN, UH...

179
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,468
WHAT WHAT WOULD WE DO?

180
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,970
DUDE, I DON'T KNOW.

181
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,972
SHE WAS KIDDING.

182
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,973
YEAH.

183
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,974
SHE WAS...

184
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,975
JUST IN CASE

185
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,477
MAYBE WE SHOULD COME UP

186
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,978
WITH A SET OF GROUND RULES.

187
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,979
YEAH, FOR SURE.

188
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,482
OKAY. PROBABLY WANT THE FIRST ONE TO BE:

189
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,983
"NEVER OPEN YOUR EYES."

190
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,986
YOU KNOW?

191
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,990
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE DOING SOMETHING

192
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,992
AND THEN LOOK UP, RIGHT?

193
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,496
AND SEE SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SEEING, YOU KNOW?

194
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,497
YEAH. GOOD CALL.

195
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,498
NICE...

196
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,501
HOLD IT. HOLD IT.

197
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,505
WHAT IF MY EYES ARE CLOSED, AND...

198
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,007
AND MY HAND IS OUT THERE...

199
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,010
AH! OKAY. EYES OPEN AT ALL TIMES.

200
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,517
OH, HEY, HOW DO WE DECIDE

201
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,520
WHERE WE, YOU KNOW, EACH WOULD

202
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,022
YOU KNOW...

203
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,524
BE?

204
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,525
RIGHT. RIGHT.

205
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,027
WELL, I, UH, WE COULD FLIP FOR IT.

206
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,030
YEAH, I GUESS, BUT, LIKE, WHAT'S HEADS AND WHAT'S TAILS?

207
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,033
WELL, IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT

208
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,035
THEN I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS WITH YOU.

209
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,541
NO, NO, NO.

210
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,543
I AM LOOKING AT A PURCHASE ORDER RIGHT HERE

211
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,044
AND IT CLEARLY STATES

212
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,546
THAT WE ORDERED THE RIVIERA BIKINI

213
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,550
IN A VARIETY OF SIZES AND COLORS, AND...

214
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,052
WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHAT I'M WEARING?

215
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,555
COULD I PLEASE SPEAK TO YOUR SUPERVISOR?

216
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,056
THANK YOU. WE'RE HOLDING.

217
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,057
HI.

218
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,058
OH! OH, MY GOD.

219
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,060
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

220
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,063
WELL, YOU SAID YOU COULDN'T GO OUT SO...

221
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,565
YOU BROUGHT A PICNIC.

222
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,066
OH, WHAT A BOYFRIEND.

223
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,570
THAT'S IT. ON MONDAY, I START WEARING MAKEUP.

224
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,572
ROSS, HONEY, THIS IS VERY NICE

225
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,073
BUT I I'VE GOT A CRISIS.

226
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,075
YEAH, BUT I'VE GOT COUSCOUS.

227
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,076
HONEY...

228
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,578
HONEY, I'M SORRY.

229
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,079
I KNOW IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY

230
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,081
BUT I TOLD YOU ON THE PHONE

231
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,583
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO STOP.

232
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,084
OKAY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO STOP.

233
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,085
I'M INVISIBLE.

234
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,086
I'M NOT HERE.

235
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,088
YEAH, BUT, I DON'T...

236
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,591
WHO APPROVED THAT ORDER?

237
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,094
WELL, THERE IS NO MARK ROBINSON IN THIS OFFICE.

238
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,596
GET ME MARK ON THE PHONE.

239
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,597
OH, I LOVE MARK.

240
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,598
DO YOU KNOW MARK?

241
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,099
YEAH.

242
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,602
LET ME JUST CHECK THAT WITH WHAT I'VE GOT HERE.

243
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,104
038 IS NOT THE NUMBER FOR THIS STORE.

244
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,105
038 IS ATLANTA, AND I...

245
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,107

246
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,611

247
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,612
PEPPER?

248
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,615
NONE FOR ME.

249
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,117
OKAY, SORRY POUR VOUS.

250
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,619
I'M SORRY. AS I WAS SAYING

251
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,120
THE STORE NUMBER IS WRONG

252
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,122
AND I'M SORRY, BUT THAT IS...

253
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,624
OH, MY GOD! ROSS!

254
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,125
GEEZ. OH, MY...

255
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,627
GOD.

256
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,129
OKAY, IT'S FINE, IT'S FINE.

257
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,131
WHOA, YEAH. OH, YEAH.

258
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,132
EXCUSE ME. I'M SORRY.

259
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,634
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK.

260
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,635
I'VE GOT SHEMP

261
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,637
IN MY OFFICE.

262
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,139
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

263
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,140
I'M SORRY, BUT, UM...

264
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,643
HEY, WHOA, SOMEBODY'S OFF THE PHONE.

265
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,645
HOW ABOUT A GLASS OF WINE BY THE FIRE?

266
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,647
I CAN GET IT GOING AGAIN IF YOU...

267
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,149
ROSS, YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME.

268
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,651
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO STOP.

269
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,652
COME ON, RACH.

270
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,654
YOU DON'T HAVE, WHAT, TEN MINUTES?

271
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,156
SOPHIE, DOES SHE HAVE TEN MINUTES?

272
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,658
HEY, ROSS, I TOLD YOU, I DON'T.

273
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,659
DON'T YELL AT ME.

274
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,661
THIS IS THE MOST I'VE SEEN YOU ALL WEEK.

275
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,163
LOOK, I CANNOT DO THIS RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

276
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,665
I HAVE GOT A DEADLINE.

277
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,166
WOULD YOU JUST GO HOME?

278
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,167
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

279
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,669
YEAH, BUT WHY...

280
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,170
GOOD BYE.

281
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,678
UH, ACTUALLY

282
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,680
THAT'S OUR THREE HOLE PUNCH.

283
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,186
HEY.

284
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,688
HI.

285
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,690
LOOK, UM, ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED EARLIER...

286
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,191
UH, WELL, I...

287
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,693
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

288
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,695
YOU WERE... YOU WERE STRESSED.

289
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:42,201
I WAS GOING TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO APOLOGIZE TOME.

290
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,204
FOR WHAT? FOR LETTING YOU THROW ME OUT OF YOUR OFFICE?

291
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,708
YOU HAD NO RIGHT COMING DOWN TO MY OFFICE, ROSS.

292
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,211
YOU DO NOT BRING A PICNIC BASKET TO SOMEBODY'S WORK

293
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,714
UNLESS MAYBE THEY WERE A PARK RANGER.

294
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,217
YEAH, WELL, EXCUSE ME FOR WANTING

295
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,220
TO BE WITH MY GIRLFRIEND ON OUR ANNIVERSARY.

296
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,221
BOY, WHAT AN ASS AM I.

297
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,726
BUT I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME.

298
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,727
YOU NEVER HAVE THE TIME.

299
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,228
I DON'T FEEL LIKE

300
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,230
I EVEN HAVE A GIRLFRIEND ANYMORE, RACHEL.

301
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,232
ROSS, WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

302
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,734
YOU WANT ME TO QUIT MY JOB

303
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,736
SO YOU CAN FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

304
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,237
NO, BUT IT WOULD BE NICE

305
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,739
IF YOU'D REALIZE THAT IT'S JUST A JOB.

306
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,242
JUST... A JOB?

307
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,744
YES.

308
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,746
ROSS, DO YOU REALIZE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE

309
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,247
I'M DOING SOMETHING I ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT?

310
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,749
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE

311
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,251
I'M DOING SOMETHING THAT I'M ACTUALLY GOOD AT.

312
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,753
I MEAN, IF YOU DON'T GET THAT...

313
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,755
NO, HEY, I GET THAT. I GET THAT BIG TIME

314
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,757
AND I'M HAPPY FOR YOU, BUT I'M TIRED OF HAVING

315
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,760
A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE, OKAY?

316
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,261
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.

317
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,763
WELL, NEITHER DO I!

318
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,765
IS THIS ABOUT MARK?

319
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,267
HUH... OH, MY GOD.

320
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,268
OKAY, IT'S NOT.

321
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,269
OH, MY GOD.

322
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,271
I CANNOT KEEP HAVING

323
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,274
THIS SAME FIGHT OVER AND OVER AGAIN, ROSS.

324
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,276
NO. YOU'RE MAKING THIS TOO HARD.

325
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,277
OH, I'M. I'M MAKING THIS TOO HARD.

326
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,779
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

327
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,280
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.

328
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,783
LOOK, MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST TAKE A BREAK.

329
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,785
OKAY, OKAY, FINE. YOU'RE RIGHT.

330
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,286
LET'S, UH, LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

331
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,788
LET'S COOL OFF, OKAY?

332
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,290
LET'S GET SOME FROZEN YOGURT OR SOMETHING.

333
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,293
NO.

334
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,296

335
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,298
A BREAK FROM US.

336
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,314
...AND THE ADVANCES IN COLLATING IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS-- PHEW.!

337
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,817
I MEAN, WE JUST GOT IN AN X-5000, YOU KNOW?

338
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,820
THE X-5000 MAKES AN X-50 LOOK LIKE A T-71.

339
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,322
OH!

340
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,325
HEY, IT'S THE DINOSAUR GUY!

341
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,827
HI, ROSS.

342
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,328
OH, HI, CHLOE.

343
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,831
I WANT YOU TO MEET SOME FRIENDS OF MINE.

344
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,334
THIS GUY'S MY HERO.

345
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,337
HE COMES IN WITH SOME STUFF, HE WANTS IT BLOWN UP 400% PERCENT.

346
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,839
WE SAY, "WE DON'T DO THAT."

347
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,841
HE SAYS, "YOU GOT TO," AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

348
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,342
WE DID IT- - AND NOW

349
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,846
ANYTIME ANYBODY WANTS 400, WE JUST SAY, "LET'S ROSS IT."

350
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,849
AND THAT'S THE ONLY COLOR THAT COMES IN.

351
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,351
YO, CHLOE, DO YOU HAVE A QUARTER

352
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,353
FOR THE CONDOM MACHINE?

353
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,355

354
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,358
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

355
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,359
I THOUGHT TONIGHT WAS

356
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,361
YOUR BIG ANNIVERSARY DINNER.

357
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,863
YEAH, A LITTLE CHANGE OF PLANS.

358
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,865
UH, WE'RE GOING TO BREAK UP INSTEAD.

359
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,870
OH, AND I CAN ALSO SPEAK A LITTLE FRENCH.

360
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,873
VOULEZ VOUS COUCHEZ AVEC MOI, CE SOIR?

361
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,876
WHY? WHAT DID I SAY?

362
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,377
WELL, YOU JUST ASKED

363
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,880
IF I WANTED TO GO TO BED WITH YOU TONIGHT.

364
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,882
OH, MY GOD.

365
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,885
NO WONDER I GET SUCH GREAT SERVICE

366
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,886
AT CAFE MAURICE.

367
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,388

368
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,390
KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK. HI.

369
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,893
UM, COULD YOU PLEASE TELL SERGEI THAT, UM...

370
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,896
I WAS FASCINATED BY WHAT BOUTROS BOUTROS GHALI SAID

371
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,397
IN THENEW YORK TIMES?

372
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,398

373
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,400

374
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,903
YOU DIDN'T SAY "BOUTROS BOUTROS GHALI."

375
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,906
BOUTROS BOUTROS GHALI.

376
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,908

377
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,409
HE SAYS HE WAS, TOO.

378
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,412
INTERESTING.

379
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,914

383
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,925
I REALLY LIKE HIS SUIT.

384
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,939
UH, HE SAID, "THANK YOU VERY MUCH."

385
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,941
HE THINKS YOU LOOK VERY PRETTY TONIGHT.

386
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,442
YOUR HAIR GOLDEN LIKE THE SUN.

387
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,443
SO, YOU'RE A CHEF?

388
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,444

389
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,946
I'M ALSO THINKING

390
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,447
OF OPENING UP MY OWN RESTAURANT.

391
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,448
OH, REALLY?

392
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,950

393
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,451

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

395
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,958
WELL, I WAS HAVING A CONVERSATION.

396
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,459
BUT MISCHA IS SO INTERESTED IN YOU

397
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,961
THAT SERGEI AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

398
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,462
TO SAY TWO WORDS TO EACH OTHER.

399
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,464
WHAT, DO YOU WANT ME TO SIT HERE SILENTLY

400
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,466

OH.

408
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,482
IS IT MY BREATH?

409
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,986
NO. SORRY. I JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE SOMEBODY ELSE. HI.

410
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,488
HI. LOOK, I WAS JUST GOING TO LEAVE A MESSAGE.

411
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,991
ISN'T TONIGHT YOUR BIG ANNIVERSARY DINNER?

412
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:32,992

YEAH. I'M FINE.

416
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:39,999
You want to talk?

417
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,500
I can come over.

418
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,002
NO. REALLY, NO.

419
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,003
PLEASE.

420
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,004
THAT'S THAT'S OKAY.

421
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,005
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, I'M COMING OVER

422
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,006

423
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,507
OH, YEAH, I'M NOT... I'M NOT HUNGRY.

424
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:49,508
It's for me.

425
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:50,509
OH.

426
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:51,510
Okay.

427
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,012
OKAY. BYE.

428
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,517
WELL, SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

429
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,019
WHAT CAN I DO?

430
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,021
ONE PERSON WANTS TO BREAK UP, YOU BREAK UP.

431
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,022
HEY, NO WAY.

432
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,023
THIS IS YOU GUYS.

433
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,024
CALL HER AND WORK IT OUT.

434
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,025
COME ON.

435
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,526
WE JUST HAD THIS HUGE FIGHT.

436
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,028
DON'T I HAVE TO WAIT A WHILE?

437
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,031
HEY, THIS ISN'T LIKE SWIMMING AFTER YOU EAT.

438
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,533
PICK UP THE PHONE!

439
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,039
THAT WHOLE SWIMMING THING IS A MYTH.

440
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,041
YEAH, TELL THAT TO MY UNCLE LENNY.

441
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,044
WHY, WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

442
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,047
NOTHING. HE JUST REALLY BELIEVES IN THAT.

443
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,549
OH, AND THEN WE GOT INTO

444
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,051
THIS BIG, STUPID FIGHT

445
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,052
AND I JUST...

446
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,053
IT WAS AWFUL.

447
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,554
I TOLD HIM HE TREATS ME

448
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,556
LIKE A PARK RANGER OR SOMETHING...

449
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,557
OH...

450
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,559
AND THEN...

451
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,063
I TOLD HIM I WANTED TO TAKE A BREAK.

452
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,066
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE A BREAK.

453
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,567
OH, I'M SORRY.

454
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:49,568

455
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,070
EGG ROLL?

456
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,072
NO.

457
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,575
AND THEN I CALLED HIM AND HE WASN'T THERE.

458
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,577
WELL, HE'S PROBABLY JUST OUT.

459
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,578
OH, THANK YOU.

460
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,080
THAT'S VERY HELPFUL.

461
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,581
I'M GLAD YOU CAME OVER.

462
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,582

463
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,586
HELLO.

464
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,088
HI, IT'S ME.

465
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,089
HI.

466
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,590
OH, I'M SO GLAD YOU CALLED.

467
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,092
Really?

468
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,593
I'VE BEEN THINKING THIS IS CRAZY.

469
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,595
DON'T YOU THINK WE CAN WORK ON THIS?

470
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,098
HEY, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DRINK?

471
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,599
WHO'S THAT?

472
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,103
NOBODY.

473
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,604
IS IT OKAY IF I FINISH

474
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,605
THE APPLE JUICE?

475
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,607
IS THAT MARK?

476
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,110
OH, HONEY, LOOK, HE JUST CAME OVER...

477
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,611
YEAH, GOT IT.

478
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,618
HEY, DINOSAUR GUY...

479
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,120
LOOK AT YOU SO SAD.

480
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,121
COME DANCE.

481
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,123
OH, THAT'S OKAY, THANKS.

482
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,124
HEY...

483
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,625
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SMILE.

484
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,627
YOU JUST HAVE TO DANCE.

485
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,129
I DON'T FEEL LIKE DANCING.

486
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,630
I FEEL LIKE HAVING A DRINK.

487
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,631
OH, OKAY.

488
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,133
HEY, TWO BEERS.

489
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,138
OKAY, NOW WE'RE JUST DANCING WITH EACH OTHER.

490
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,648
AND THE VET SAID IT WAS TIME

491
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,651
AND SO, FROM HALF A WORLD A WAY

492
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,654
WHILE MY MOTHER HELD THE PHONE TO HIS EAR

493
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,157
I SAID GOOD BYE TO MY DOG...

494
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,659
IN SEVEN LANGUAGES.

495
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,662
COULD I HAVE A TISSUE?

496
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:24,663
OH, YEAH, SURE.

497
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:25,664
I JUST HOPE

498
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,166
YOU DON'T ACCIDENTALY

499
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,168
SUCK IT UP THROUGH YOUR NOSE

500
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,669
AND CHOKE ON IT.

501
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,673

502
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,176
SERGEI WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE

503
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,678
FOR MY BEHAVIOR TONIGHT.

504
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,182
WELL, TELL HIM APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

505
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,186
OH, HE'S UNBELIEVABLE

506
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,688
I MEAN, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE YEARS

507
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,690
SOMEONE ACTUALLY WANTS TO TALK TO ME

508
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,693
BUT DO YOU THINK HE WOULD LET ME ENJOY THAT? NO!

509
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,195
YOU SILLY DIPLOMAT.

510
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,697
WHY DON'T YOU LEARN SOME ENGLISH, SERGEI?

511
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,700
EXCUSE ME, BUT, UM...

MY GUY HAS COUPONS.

522
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,241
YOUR GUY CAN'T EVEN SAY "COUPONS."

523
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,748

WELL, YOU'RE PRACTICALLY DANCING ALREADY.

535
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,780
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DO IT OVER HERE?

536
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,282

OH, BE HOME, BE HOME, BE HOME, BE HOME, BE HOME, BE HOME.
