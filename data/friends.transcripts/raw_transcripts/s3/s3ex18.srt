1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,504

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,008
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,009
OH, NOTHING.

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,510
NO, IT'S AN ACTING EXERCISE

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,512
I'M PRACTICING MY FAKE LAUGH.

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,015
OH.

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,517

8
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,519
WHAT? WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

9
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,523
 OH, NO, NO.

10
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,524
NO, NO, NO, NO.

11
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,526
THERE'S NONE OF THAT IN HERE.

12
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,527
OH, COME ON, MAN.

13
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,030
AT LEAST LET ME FINISH THIS LAST ONE.

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,033
OKAY. BUT ONLY IF YOU GIVE ME A DRAG.

15
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,035
OKAY.

16
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,041
OH...

17
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,542
OH, DARK MOTHER.

18
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,045
ONCE AGAIN I SUCKLE AT YOUR SMOKY TEAT.

19
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,049
NO, NO.

20
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,551
WHY DON'T YOU HOLD ON TO THAT ONE?

21
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,553

22
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,063
OKAY, THAT'S, LIKE, THE LEAST FUN GAME EVER.

23
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,065
WELL, I'M REALLY SICK OF YOUR SMOKING

24
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,066
SO I BROUGHT SOMETHING

25
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,068
THAT IS GOING TO HELP YOU QUIT.

26
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,069
OH.

27
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,077
NOPE. THAT PATCH IS NO GOOD.

28
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,079

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,082
COME ON, IT'S A HYPNOSIS TAPE.

30
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,085
THIS WOMAN AT WORK USED IT FOR TWO WEEKS STRAIGHT

31
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,586
AND SHE HASN'T SMOKED SINCE.

32
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,088
HUH!

33
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,590
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

34
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,095
NOTHING. IT'S JUST THAT HYPNOSIS IS BEYOND CRAP.

35
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,098
ROSS, I WATCHED YOU GET HYPNOTIZED

36
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,099
IN ATLANTIC CITY.

37
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,102
HEY, THAT GUY DID NOT HYPNOTIZE ME, OKAY?

38
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,104
OH, RIGHT. BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS PULL YOUR PANTS DOWN

39
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,106
ON THE COUNT OF THREE AND PLAY "WIPE OUT"

40
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,607
ON YOUR BUTT CHEEKS.

41
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,609
LOOK, I WAS JUST TRYING TO DISTRACT ATTENTION

42
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,611
FROM THAT POOR, OLD WOMAN WHO WAS TRYING

43
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,613
TO STUFF HER BREASTS INTO TUBE SOCKS.

44
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,616
ALL RIGHT, FORGET HYPNOSIS.

45
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,118
THE WAY TO QUIT SMOKING

46
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,121
IS YOU HAVE TO DANCE NAKED IN A FIELD OF HEATHER

47
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,624
AND THEN BATHE IN THE SWEAT OF SIX HEALTHY YOUNG MEN.

48
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:09,129
OR WHAT MY FATHER CALLS "THURSDAY NIGHT."

49
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:19,139
?  ?

50
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,641
?  ?

51
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,144
?  ?

52
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:28,148
?  ?

53
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,650
?  ?

54
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,154
?  ?

55
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,657
?  ?

56
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,160
?  ?

57
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,662
?  ?

58
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,165
?  ?

59
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,667
?  ?

60
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:54,174
?  ?

61
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,677
HERE YOU GO.

62
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,679
OH, THANKS. OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

63
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,681
I DIDN'T WANT CINNAMON ON THIS.

64
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,183
SORRY.

65
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,191
HI.

66
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:11,691
OH, MY GOD!

67
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,692
HI!

68
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,194
FRANK! HI!

69
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,695
HOW ARE YOU?

70
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,197
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

71
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,198
WELL, YOU KNOW

72
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,699
I WOULD HAVE CALLED

73
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,201
BUT I LOST YOUR PHONE NUMBER

74
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,703
AND THEN MY MOM LOCKED ME OUT OF THE HOUSE

75
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,205
SO I COULDN'T FIND IT

76
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,207
AND THEN I TRIED TO FIND A PAY PHONE

77
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,709
AND THE RECEIVER WAS CUT OFF, SO...

78
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,712
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

79
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,214
UH... OH.

80
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,715
UH... VANDALISM.

81
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,719
BUT ALSO... WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR MOM?

82
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,720
WELL, WE GOT IN A FIGHT

83
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,224
UH, BECAUSE SHE SAID THAT I WAS TOO IMMATURE TO GET MARRIED.

84
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,225
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED?!

85
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,726
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

86
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,728
OH, MY GOD!

87
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,231
MY LITTLE BROTHER'S GETTING MARRIED!

88
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,232
YEAH.

89
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,734
I KNEW YOU'D BE SO COOL ABOUT THIS.

90
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,736
ALL RIGHT, HEY, DO YOU WANT TO MEET HER?

91
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,238
DO I?!

92
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,739
DO YOU?

93
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,741
YEAH, I DO! YEAH!

94
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,743
OKAY, COOL! ALL RIGHT!

95
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,245
SHE'S JUST, UH, PARKING THE TRUCK.

96
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,747
I'M GOING TO... I'M GOING TO GO GET MY, UH...

97
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,749
MY FIANCEE, MAN!

98
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,254
YOU KNOW, I WOULD HAVE BET GOOD MONEY

99
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,257
THAT HE'D BE THE FIRST ONE OF US TO GET MARRIED.

100
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,758
YEAH, ISN'T IT FANTASTIC?

101
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,260
YEAH, BUT, PHEEBS, DON'T YOU THINK

102
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,761
HE'S A LITTLE YOUNG TO GET MARRIED?

103
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,263
WELL, HE'S 18.

104
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,764
EXACTLY. IT WILL BE ILLEGAL

105
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,766
FOR HIM TO DRINK AT HIS OWN BACHELOR PARTY.

106
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,769
YEAH, OR TO GET A HOOKER.

107
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,772
ALWAYS ILLEGAL, JOE.

108
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,276
HEY... THIS IS, UH...

109
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,778
MY FIANCEE, MRS. KNIGHT.

110
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,280

111
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,284
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

112
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,786
FRANK'S TOLD ME SO MUCH ABOUT YOU

113
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,289
BUT YOU'RE NOT HOW I PICTURED YOU AT ALL.

114
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,292
YEAH.I'M A BIG SURPRISE.

115
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,293
HERE YOU GO.

116
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,294
OH, THANK YOU.

117
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,795
OH, YEAH. GRAB A SEAT.

118
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,298
SO, UH, HOW DID YOU GUYS MEET?

119
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,299
WELL, UM...

120
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,301
I WAS IN MRS. KNIGHTS'...

121
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,802
I MEAN ALICE. SORRY.

122
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,804
ALICE. I ALWAYS DO THAT.

123
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,306

124
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,307
YOU KNOW...

125
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,309
I WAS IN HER HOME EC CLASS.

126
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,311
AND HE WAS MY BEST STUDENT.

127
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,313
YEAH. SHE WAS MY BEST TEACHER.

128
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,814
OH!

129
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,825
IF THAT DOESN'T KEEP KIDS IN SCHOOL, WHAT WILL?

130
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,331
AND SO NOW YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO BE MARRIED.

131
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,832
YEAH. YOU KNOW

132
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,335
WE TALKED ABOUT JUST LIVING TOGETHER

133
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,836
BUT, UM...

134
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,839
WE WANT TO HAVE KIDS RIGHT AWAY!

135
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,841

136
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,844
OH, MY GOD.

137
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,346
GREAT!

138
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,850
WOW. KIDS. FRANK, ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE READY FOR THAT?

139
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,352
HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

140
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,355
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, YOU KNOW... BABIES.

141
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,357
WHO DOESN'T WANT BABIES, RIGHT?

142
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,359
AND BESIDES, YOU KNOW

143
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,862
I NEVER HAD A DAD AROUND, AND NOW I ALWAYS WILL

144
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,865
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT WILL BE ME, RIGHT?

145
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,866

146
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,870
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, REALLY, WE DO REALIZE

147
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,872
THAT THERE'S AN AGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US.

148
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,375
OH, GOOD. OKAY. BECAUSE YOU WERE ACTING LIKE YOU DIDN'T.

149
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,877
OH, NO, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO LOVE

150
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,878
WHAT DOES AGE MATTER?

151
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,380

152
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,881

153
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,882

154
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,883
MM... MM...

155
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,389
 You are falling fast asleep.

156
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,392
Deeper... deeper... deeper...

157
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,894
You are now completely asleep.

158
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,397
You don't need to smoke.

159
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,400
Cigarettes don't control you.

160
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,403
You are a strong, confident woman

161
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,406
who does not need to smoke.

162
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,409
A strong, confident woman...

163
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,912
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

164
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,414
I JUST REALIZED, IN THE LAST YEAR

165
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,916
I'VE ONLY GONE OUT WITH TWO GUYS: RICHARD AND JULIO.

166
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,918
YOU GOT TO HELP ME OUT HERE.

167
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,920
YOU GOT TO SET ME UP, YOU GOT TO GET ME BACK IN THE GAME.

168
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,422
WELL, THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.

169
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,924
I MEAN, I WORK IN FASHION, AND ALL I MEET

170
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,427
ARE ELIGIBLE STRAIGHT MEN.

171
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,430
PETE, CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING ELSE?

172
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,931
I'LL HAVE A SLICE OF CHEESECAKE

173
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,433
AND A DATE, IF YOU'RE GIVING THEM OUT.

174
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,935
HAVEN'T YOU AND I COVERED THAT TOPIC?

175
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,937
COME ON. YOU JUST SAID TO HER...

176
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,939
YOU ONLY WANT TO GO OUT WITH ME

177
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,441
BECAUSE OF MY BLOND WIG AND THE BIG BOOBS

178
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,443
AND THE FACT THAT I SERVE YOU FOOD.

179
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,945
WELL, IF THAT WERE TRUE, I'D BE DATING

180
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,447
MY AUNT RUTH.

181
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,949
AND THE TWO TIMES WE WENT OUT

182
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,951
IT WAS JUST PLAIN AWKWARD.

183
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,953
COME ON, YOU THINK SHE SHOULD GO OUT WITH ME, DON'T YOU?

184
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,455

185
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,958
WELL, I MEAN, ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO GO OUT WITH HER?

186
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,461
I MEAN, THAT AIN'T A PRETTY PICTURE IN THE MORNING.

187
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,962
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

188
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,464
THAT WIG

189
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,965
ALL IN DISARRAY AND...

190
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,468
BOOBS FLUNG OVER THE NIGHTSTAND.

191
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,469
OH, YEAH.

192
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,471
I MEAN, REALLY, THINK ABOUT IT.

193
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,472
OH HO, I WILL.

194
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,476
NO, I KNOW, I KNOW

195
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,480
THAT THIS IS FRANK'S LIFE, YOU KNOW?

196
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,482
YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO BE ALL JUDGMENTAL, YOU KNOW

197
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,983
BUT THIS IS SICK.

198
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,485
IT'S SICK AND WRONG!

199
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,487
PHEEBS, WHAT? IS IT THE AGE THING?

200
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,489
NO, NO. OH, I'M FINE WITH THE AGE THING

201
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,991
UNTIL IT STARTS STICKING ITS TONGUE

202
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,494
DOWN MY LITTLE BROTHER'S THROAT.

203
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,497
PHEEBS, HE SEEMS TO ENJOY IT.

204
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,499
BUT, I MEAN, DO YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO ENJOY IT

205
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,001
WHEN HE'S UP TO HIS ELBOWS IN THE DIAPERS

206
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,503
OF ALL THE BABIES

207
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,004
THEY HAVE TO HAVE RIGHT AWAY?

208
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,506
THIS IS NOT FAIR TO FRANK

209
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,508
AND IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE BABIES.

210
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,009
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

211
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,011
IT'S NOT GOOD HOME ECONOMICS.

212
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,516
WELL, HAVE YOU TOLD HIM HOW YOU FEEL?

213
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,517
YES.

214
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,519
NOT OUT LOUD.

215
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,021
PHEEBS, HE'S NOT A MIND READER.

216
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,523
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

217
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,024
PHEEBS, IF YOU DON'T TELL HIM

218
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,026
SOON HE'S GOING TO BE MARRIED

219
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,529
AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HATE YOURSELF.

220
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,032
YEAH, BUT IF I DO TELL HIM, THEN HE'S GOING TO HATE MYSELF.

221
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,034
I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM AND HIS MOM.

222
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,537
I CAN'T.

223
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,038
BUT YOU GUYS CAN.

224
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,040
PLEASE, YOU GOT TO TALK HIM OUT OF IT.

225
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,543
 NO, NO, NO, NO...

226
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,545
COME ON, YOU GUYS!

227
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,547
YOU HAVE... YOU...

228
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,048
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.

229
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,550
I HAVE EVERYTHING TO LOSE.

230
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,552
DO YOU WANT ME TO LOSE EVERYTHING?

231
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,053
EVERYTHING?

232
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,056
NO.

233
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,559
OKAY. I'M GOING TO GO GET FRANK.

234
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,564
SO, WE'RE WALKING DOWN THE STREET

235
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,065
AND I TURN TO YOU AND I SAY

236
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,568
"HEY! LET'S GO HANG OUT AT TOTALLY NUDE NUDES."

237
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,069
REMEMBER? AND THEN...

238
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,071
AND THEN YOU TURN TO ME AND YOU SAY

239
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,073
"NAH. LET'S JUST HANG OUT AT YOUR PLACE."

240
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,075
WELL, THAT WAS A NICE MOVE, DUMB ASS.

241
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,079
I THINK YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GO OUT WITH THIS GUY.

242
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,582
NAH. HE JUST DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR ME.

243
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,083
MONICA, LAST SATURDAY NIGHT

244
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,085
WHAT HAPPENED ON WALKER, TEXAS RANGER?

245
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,589
WELL, WALKER WAS LOOKING FOR THIS BIG BUSLOAD OF KIDS...

246
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,090
HE WAS...

247
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,592
ALL RIGHT. I GET YOUR POINT.

248
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,093
ALL RIGHT.

249
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,094
HI.

250
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,596
 HEY.

251
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,599
YOU KNOW, I FORGOT THE COMBINATION TO THIS

252
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,600
ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

253
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,602
I JUST CARRY IT AROUND.

254
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,103
YOU GOT ANY CHAP STICK?

255
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,605
UH, YEAH.

256
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,106
HEY, HOW ARE THOSE TAPES WORKING OUT FOR YOU?

257
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,608
YOU KNOW WHAT? PRETTY GOOD. GOOD!

258
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,610
I HAVEN'T SMOKED YET TODAY.

259
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,612
I FEEL GREAT AND CONFIDENT...

260
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,614
THAT IS A STUNNING BLOUSE.

261
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,618
THANK YOU.

262
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,620
HERE YOU GO.

263
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,123
HEY, MON, LET'S GIVE PETE A CHANCE.

264
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,626
COME ON. HE WAS FUNNY, HE SEEMS REALLY NICE

265
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,628
AND THAT CHECK THING WAS ADORABLE.

266
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,129
WHAT CHECK THING?

267
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,131
AS A JOKE, THIS CUSTOMER AT WORK

268
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,634
WHO HAS A CRUSH ON ME GAVE ME A $20,000 DOLLARS TIP.

269
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,135
HIS NUMBER'S ON THE CHECK.

270
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,137
HE JUST DID IT SO I'D CALL.

271
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,639
PETE BECKER.

272
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,641
PETE...

273
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,148
IS THIS HIM?

274
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,650
THAT'S BILL CLINTON.

275
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,654
WHO IS HE HUGGING?

276
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,657
OH, MY GOD.

277
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,658
THAT'S PETE!

278
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,159
WHY IS BILL HUGGING PETE?

279
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,161
THIS GUY INVENTED MOSS 865.

280
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,164
EVERY OFFICE IN THE WORLD USES THAT PROGRAM.

281
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:05,665
WE USE IT!

282
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,667
THERE YOU GO!

283
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,669
OH, MY GOD. MONICA'S GOING TO GO OUT

284
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,170
WITH A MILLIONAIRE.

285
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,673
NO. I'M NOT GOING TO GO OUT WITH HIM.

286
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,174
WHY NOT? HE'S A MILLIONAIRE.

287
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,176
SO?

288
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,678
OH, MY GOD! I CAN'T BELIEVE

289
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,680
THIS IS A REAL $20,000 DOLLARS CHECK.

290
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,181
OH, THIS IS JUST SO EXCITING.

291
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,684
OR INCREDIBLY OFFENSIVE.

292
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,185
WELL, YEAH. SURE, THAT, TOO.

293
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,699
WHAT?

294
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,204
ALL WE'RE SAYING IS DON'T RUSH INTO ANYTHING.

295
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,706
YEAH. COME ON, THINK ABOUT IT.

296
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,207
YOU'RE 18, OKAY?

297
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,709
SHE'S 44.

298
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,713
WHEN YOU'RE 36, SHE'S GOING TO BE 88.

299
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,716
WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW THAT?

300
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,720
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO GO PLAY BASKETBALL.

301
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,723
OR AT LEAST LET THE REALLY GOOD GUYS USE MY BALL

302
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,225
WHILE I SAY, "CAN I PLAY? CAN I PLAY?"

303
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,231
OH, UH, JOE, YOU LEFT YOUR KEYS IN THE DOOR.

304
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,232
OH.

305
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,734
HERE YOU GO.

306
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,242
ANYWAY...

307
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,744
THE POINT IS

308
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,245
THERE'S A LOT OF WOMEN OUT THERE

309
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,247
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN HAD SEX WITH YET.

310
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,750
YEAH. HE'S... HE'S RIGHT. HE'S RIGHT.

311
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,752
THIS IS YOUR TIME, YOU KNOW?

312
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,754
YOU'RE YOUNG, YOU'RE WEIRD...

313
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,255
CHICKS DIG THAT.

314
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,757
OKAY, BUT ISN'T SEX BETTER

315
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,760
WHEN IT'S WITH ONE PERSON THAT YOU REALLY, REALLY CARE ABOUT?

316
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,262
YEAH, IN A POEM, MAYBE.

317
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,764
NO, THE MAN'S RIGHT.

318
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,767
THAT'S WHAT I HAD WITH RACHEL.

319
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,268
YOU DON'T HAVE IT ANYMORE?

320
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,770
NO, I, UH...

321
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,772
I SLEPT WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

322
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,774
OKAY, SO WAIT. ALL RIGHT.

323
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,276
SO HOW DID THAT MAKE THINGS BETTER?

324
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,279
IT DIDN'T.

325
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,283
OKAY, SO WHAT YOU USED TO HAVE WITH RACHEL

326
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,285
IS WHAT I GOT WITH ALICE.

327
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,286
WHAT IS THAT LIKE?

328
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,287
IT'S SO COOL, MAN.

329
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,289
IT'S JUST BECAUSE BEING WITH HER

330
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,292
IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN, LIKE... NOT BEING WITH HER.

331
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,794
YEAH, YEAH.

332
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,795
WHY CAN'T I FIND THAT?

333
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:16,796
DON'T ASK ME.

334
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,297
I HAD IT AND I BLEW IT.

335
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,799
WELL, I WANT IT!

336
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,800
YOU CAN HAVE IT!

337
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,801
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE I CAN'T.

338
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,302
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME.

339
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,804
NO, IT'S OUT THERE, MAN.

340
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,305
I'VE SEEN IT.

341
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,306
I GOT IT.

342
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,809
THEN YOU HOLD ON TO IT!

343
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,310
ALL RIGHT, MAN!

344
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,812
ALL RIGHT, CONGRATULATIONS!

345
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,313
YOU LUCKY BASTARD!

346
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,315
YOU'RE FRANK'S BEST MAN?!

347
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,319
I COULDN'T HELP IT.

348
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,821
THEIR LOVE IS SO PURE.

349
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,824
WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU, HUH?

350
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,826
I'M THE RING BEARER.

351
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,842

352
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,844
OH, ALICE, HI.

353
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,846
I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD COME

354
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,348
BECAUSE I GOT A REAL HOME EC EMERGENCY.

355
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,350
OH, MY GOD. WHO DIED ON THIS?

356
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,852
YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW.

357
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,854
IT'S A REAL MUSTARD TASTROPHE.

358
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,855

359
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,856
CAN YOU HELP ME?

360
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,357
ABSOLUTELY.

361
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,360
FIRST WE'LL START WITH A LITTLE CLUB SODA AND SALT.

362
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,863
IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, THEN WE CAN GO BACK TO...

363
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,364
YOU KNOW WHAT? FORGET IT. IT'S RUINED.

364
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,866
OH, NO, NEVER SAY THAT.

365
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,869
IF YOU CAN'T GET IT OUT, THEN YOU CAN CUT AROUND THE STAIN

366
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,371
ADD A LITTLER LACE, YOU MAKE A STYLISH THROW.

367
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,373
OR, INSTEAD, MAYBE YOU COULD

368
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,876
JUST NOT MARRY MY BROTHER FRANK.

369
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,382
OKAY, THAT'S GREAT, BUT COULD WE MAKE IT SMALLER?

370
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,384
CAN WE MAKE IT FIT ON THE HEAD OF A PIN?

371
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,887
I LOVE WHEN WE MAKE THINGS FIT ON THE HEAD OF A PIN.

372
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,888

373
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,390
You have a Ms. Monica Geller here.

374
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,393
UH, ABSOLUTELY. YEAH, SEND HER IN.

375
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,895
HI.

376
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,398
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

377
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,900
HANG ON FOR A SEC.

378
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,901
I'LL TALK TO YOU IN THE MORNING?

379
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,903
You got it.

380
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,404
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

381
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,405
SERIOUSLY

382
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,907
WHAT IS THIS SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

383
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,410
WELL, YOU KNOW-- I NEVER KNOW HOW MUCH TO TIP.

384
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,914
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DOUBLE THE TAX...

385
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,415
NOT DOUBLE THE TAX OF ROMANIA.

386
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,417
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

387
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,919
ARE YOU TRYING TO BUY ME?

388
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,421
IS THIS THE WAY YOU GET GIRLS TO GO OUT WITH YOU?

389
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,924
Uh... I'm still here.

390
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,429
YOU'RE TAKING THIS ALL WRONG, BECAUSE IF

391
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,932
I DIDN'T LEAVE YOU THAT TIP, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE COME DOWN HERE

392
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,934
WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS ARGUMENT

393
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,936
AND THERE WOULDN'T BE THIS HEAT BETWEEN US.

394
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,437
WHAT?

395
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,939
COME ON, YOU GOT TO, UH, ADMIT

396
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,441
THAT OUR RELATIONSHIP IS HITTING A NEW LEVEL NOW

397
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,443
BECAUSE YOU USED TO BE, LIKE, THE CHEF

398
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,945
AND I WAS THE CUSTOMER

399
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,947
BUT NOW WE'RE LIKE THIS COUPLE THAT FIGHTS.

400
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,952
OKAY, UM, YOU'RE A LOON, YOU KNOW?

401
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,454
LOOK, FORGET THE CHECK, OKAY?

402
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,956
I LIKE YOU.

403
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,458
I THINK YOU'RE GREAT.

404
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,460
COME ON, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

405
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,464
I DON'T KNOW.

406
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,466
WHY NOT?

407
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,469
I DON'T WANT TO ENCOURAGE THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR.

408
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,972
ONE MEAL.

409
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,975
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING FOR. PLEASE.

410
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,477
WE GO OUT, WE EAT

411
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,479
AND, IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GOOD TIME

412
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,481
I GIVE YOU TEN GRAND, WE CALL IT EVEN.

413
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,992
HI.

414
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:33,993

415
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:34,994
GOD! NO!

416
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,496
WAIT. JUST PUT THE MAIL DOWN. IT'S ME.

417
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,498
OKAY. SORRY.

418
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,001
WHY WERE YOU JUST, LIKE, ALL IN THE DARK?

419
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,004
OH, WELL, UM, YOUR YOUR LAUNDRY SMELLED SO GOOD

420
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,506
THAT I THOUGHT I'D CURL UP IN IT.

421
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,507
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?

422
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,508
OH, YEAH. SURE.

423
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,010
SO, HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

424
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,512
WELL, JUST PROBABLY THE WORST ONE

425
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,014
SINCE I'VE BEEN ALIVE.

426
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,018
WHAT, UM, WHAT HAPPENED?

427
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,519
UM...

428
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,021
ALICE, UH...

429
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,022
SHE, UH...

430
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,523
CALLED IT OFF.

431
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,025
OH, NO.

432
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,029
DID, UM, DID SHE SAY WHY?

433
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,530
UH, NO, NOT REALLY.

434
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,032
JUST THAT I WAS TOO YOUNG.

435
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,036
BUT I DON'T SEE HOW I COULD ALL OF A SUDDEN BE TOO YOUNG

436
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,539
BECAUSE I'M OLDER THAN I WAS WHEN WE FIRST GOT TOGETHER.

437
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,541
YEAH, YEAH.

438
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,543
NO, I DON'T...

439
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,544
I DON'T KNOW.

440
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,046
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

441
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,548
MAYBE IT'S JUST ALL FOR THE BEST.

442
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:33,052
YEAH, IF... THE BEST IS, LIKE, UNBELIEVABLE PAIN.

443
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,553
OH, SWEETIE...

444
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,055
OH...

445
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,058
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST FINALLY HAPPY, YOU KNOW?

446
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,560
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE...

447
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,063
AFTER MY DAD LEFT ME...

448
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,065
AND THEN... AND THEN...

449
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,568
GETTING ARRESTED FOR STEALING THOSE BIRDS...

450
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,070
AND THEN THE...

451
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,572
AND THEN THE... WHOLE PUNCTURED LUNG THING...

452
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:57,076
I CAN ST... IT'S STILL REALLY HARD

453
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,078
TO TAKE DEEP BREATHS IN COLD WEATHER

454
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:03,082
BUT WITH ALICE, ALL THAT STUFF KIND OF WENT AWAY.

455
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,084
AND NOW IT'S...

456
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,587
NOW IT'S GONE, AND I DON'T KNOW WHY!

457
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,091
UH, WELL, I CAN TELL YOU WHY.

458
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,093
IT'S IT'S BECAUSE OF ME.

459
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,595
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

460
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,098
I ONLY DID IT BECAUSE I LOVE YOU, OKAY?

461
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,101
WHAT?

462
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,102
UM... WELL, I...

463
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,604
I KIND OF HAD A LITTLE CHAT WITH ALICE

464
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,108
AND I SORT OF MADE HER SEE WHY YOU TWO SHOULDN'T BE TOGETHER.

465
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,110
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IT, TOO, ONE DAY.

466
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,611
YOU REALLY, REALLY WILL.

467
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,612
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT.

468
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,114
THIS IS BECAUSE OF YOU?

469
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,115
OKAY...

470
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,616
WAIT, NO.

471
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,618
MY MOTHER DIDN'T WANT US TO BE TOGETHER

472
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,620
BUT THE WORST THING SHE EVER DID

473
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,621
WAS TIE ME TO THE PORCH.

474
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,124
OKAY, BUT...

475
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,125
WAIT. YOU KNOW WHAT?

476
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,126
I I CAME TO YOU

477
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,627
BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU'D UNDERSTAND!

478
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,130
OH, NO, I...

479
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,632
YOU KNOW? OH...

480
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,136
I WOULD STORM OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW

481
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,140
IF I HAD SOME MONEY OR A PLACE TO GO.

482
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,646
ROSS, IF YOU HAD A MILLION DOLLARS

483
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,648
WHAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU'D BUY?

484
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,150
I'D PROBABLY GET SOME MUNICIPAL BONDS

485
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,152
THEN PUT THE REST OF THE MONEY IN THE BANK

486
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,653
AND LIVE OFF THE INTEREST.

487
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,657
WELL, WE'VE HEARD FROM DR. FUN.

488
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,659

489
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,161
OH, MY GOD. THE MILLIONAIRE'S HERE.

490
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,662
OH, MY GOD!

491
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,668
YOU GUYS, PLEASE?

492
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,670
I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE DINNER WITH HIM, OKAY?

493
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,173
OKAY, OKAY, JUST BECAUSE HE BUYS YOU DINNER

494
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,675
DOES NOT MEAN YOU OWE HIM ANYTHING.

495
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,178
I KNOW.

496
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,181
OKAY, THEN GET THE LOBSTER.

497
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,686
HEY. HI.

498
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,188
HI. HI.

499
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,690
HEY, HOW MUCH CASH YOU GOT

500
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,193
IN YOUR POCKET RIGHT NOW?

501
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,698
AND THAT'S WHY I'M NOT INVITING YOU IN FOR A DRINK.

502
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,200
BYE!

503
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,701
WHY NOT? WAIT!

504
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,203
WHY NOT A DRINK?

505
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,704
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO?

506
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,206
DO YOU LIKE PIZZA?

507
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,707
OH... THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

508
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,209
I KNOW A GREAT LITTLE PLACE.

509
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,211
? WHEN THE MOON HITS YOUR EYE ?

510
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,713
? LIKE A BIG PIZZA PIE ?

511
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,215
? THAT'S AMORE ?

512
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,717
HEY, YOU'RE NOT PAYING FOR THE PIZZA.

513
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,219
OH, COME ON, IT'S ONLY FAIR.

514
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,221
YOU PAID FOR THE FLIGHT.

515
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,722
NOW, IS THAT ENOUGH LIRA?

516
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,225
UH, I'D THROW ANOTHER THOUSAND ON THERE.

517
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,726
WELL, HOW MUCH IS THAT?

518
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,228
THAT'S ABOUT 60 CENTS.

519
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,232
? THAT'S AMORE. ?

520
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,735
OH!

521
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,737
OOH...

522
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,241
EVERY NIGHT...!

523
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,245
 You don't need to smoke.

524
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,748
Cigarettes don't control you.

525
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:53,752
You're a strong, confident woman

526
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,755
who does not need to smoke.

527
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:02,761
A strong, confident woman who does not need to smoke.

528
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,767
OW!

529
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,270
So can I.

530
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,278
HEY, FRANK.

531
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,780
LOOK, OKAY, I KNOW THAT YOU THINK

532
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,784
I DID THIS, LIKE, TOTALLY EVIL THING, BUT I SO DIDN'T.

533
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,786
THERE'S SOMEONE HERE WHO I THINK

534
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,289
CAN EXPLAIN THIS BETTER THAN I CAN.

535
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,296
HI, FRANK.

536
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,800
HI...

537
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,802
MRS. KNIGHT.

538
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,307
PHOEBE'S RIGHT, FRANK.

539
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,309
I KNOW IT'S HARD TO HEAR

540
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,311
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG TO GO THROUGH WITH IT.

541
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,813
I... I WAS BEING SELFISH.

542
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,315
EVEN THOUGH WE WANT

543
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,817
THE SAME THINGS RIGHT NOW

544
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,320
IN THE FUTURE...

545
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,821
WE MAY NOT.

546
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,323
IS THAT IT? IS THAT WHAT IT IS?

547
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,824
YES, BUT NOT JUST THAT.

548
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,825
RIGHT. NOT JUST THAT...

549
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,328
UM...

550
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,331
EVEN THOUGH...

551
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,834
WE LOVE EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS WE DO

552
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,337
NONETHELESS...

553
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,340
NONETHELESS...

554
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,841
NONETHELESS...

555
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,345
UM...

556
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,348
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO...

557
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,850
TO REALLY KNOW WHAT

558
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,352
YOU WANT...

559
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,355
ALL RIGHT, EXACTLY.

560
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,858
ALL RIGHT, IT'S A GOOD BYE KISS.

561
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,860
THAT'S GOOD.

562
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,362
BYE BYE.

563
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:47,866
OKAY, NO, THE IMPORTANT THING IS IS THAT YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING.

564
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,868
YOU KNOW, JUST, YOU KNOW...

565
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,371
THIS IS CLEARLY WRONG.

566
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:56,375
OKAY, I'VE DECIDED I'M GOING TO LET THIS HAPPEN.

567
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,877
OKAY, CAN I JUST GET MY PURSE?

568
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,379
MMM...

569
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,880
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. GOOD.

570
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,887
 Cigarettes don't control you.

571
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,890
You're a strong, confident woman

572
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,892
who does not need to smoke.

573
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,394

574
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,895

575
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,898
 Joey's your best friend.

576
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:24,403
You want to make him a cheese sandwich every day.

577
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,407
And you also want to buy him

578
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,409
hundreds of dollars worth of pants.

579
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,913
