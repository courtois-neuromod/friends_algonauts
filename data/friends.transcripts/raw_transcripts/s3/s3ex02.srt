1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,004
ALL RIGHT, THEY GOT WATER

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,007
ORANGE JUICE AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE CIDER.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,508
TASTE IT.

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,515
YUP. IT'S FAT.

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,017
I DRANK FAT!

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,018
YEAH, I KNOW.

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,020
I DID THAT TWO MINUTES AGO.

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,523
HEY.

9
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,525
HEY, MR. TUX.

10
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,027
WHY AREN'T YOU GUYS DRESSED?

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,028
WE HAVE A HALF HOUR.

12
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,030
FOUR MINUTES AGO, YOU HAD A HALF HOUR.

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,031
WE HAVE TO BE OUT THE DOOR

14
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,532
AT 20 TO 8:00.

15
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,533
RELAX, ROSS, WE'LL BE READY.

16
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,535
IT ONLY TAKES US TWO MINUTES TO GET DRESSED.

17
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,537
YOU KNOW, I'D FEEL A WHOLE LOT BETTER IF YOU GOT DRESSED NOW.

18
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,040
OKAY. OKAY.

19
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,543
HEY, HEY!

20
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,045
OH, LOOK AT YOU--

21
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,046
ALL SEXY.

22
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,047
REALLY?

23
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,048
OH!

24
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,050
WOW.

25
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,051
MMM, HI.

26
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,052
HI.

27
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,554
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T COME OVER EARLIER?

28
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,556
BECAUSE I'M A STUPID, STUPID MAN.

29
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,060
HEY, ROSS, WANT SOME CIDER?

30
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,561
NO.

31
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,564
SO, UH, LET'S SEE. YOU'RE PRETTY CLOSE, HUH?

32
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,067
WELL, MAKEUP'S ON, HAIR IS DONE...

33
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,568
YEAH, I JUST HAVE TO GET DRESSED.

34
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,070
YAY. AND THAT TAKES, WHAT?

35
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,571
JUST SIX OR SEVEN MINUTES?

36
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,074
YEAH. ONCE I FIGURE OUT WHAT I'M WEARING.

52
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,629
WHAT'S THE MATTER, ROSS?

53
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,631
ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT YOUR SPEECH?

54
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,134
NOPE.

55
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,635
YOU WANT TO HEAR IT?

56
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,636
AM I IN IT?

57
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,639
UH HUH.

58
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,143
YEAH, RIGHT AFTER I THANK EVERYONE

59
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,644
FOR GIVING MONEY TO THE MUSEUM

60
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,147
I SING A SONG ABOUT THE WONDER THAT IS JOEY.

61
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,150
HELLO.

62
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,151
 HI.

63
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,152
 WHOA.

64
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,654
 WELL, HELLO. YOU LOOK GREAT.

65
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,655
THANK YOU.

66
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,157
I KNOW, THOUGH.

67
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,158
YOU SEE THIS?

68
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,161
THIS IS A PERSON WHO IS READY TO GO.

69
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,164
PHOEBE, YOU... OH, YOU ARE MY STAR.

70
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,167
OH. WELL, YOU'RE... MY LUCKY PENNY.

71
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,173
ALL RIGHT. I TOOK THE QUIZ, AND IT TURNS OUT

72
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,175
I DO PUT CAREER BEFORE MEN.

73
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,179
GET UP.

74
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,680
WHAT?

75
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,681
YOU'RE IN MY SEAT.

76
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,683
HOW IS THIS YOUR SEAT?

77
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,688
BECAUSE I WAS SITTING THERE.

78
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,190
BUT THEN YOU LEFT.

79
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,692
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE I WENT TO SPAIN.

80
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,694
I WENT TO THE BATHROOM.

81
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,696
YOU KNEW I WAS COMING BACK.

82
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,697
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

83
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,698
SIT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

84
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,701
THE BIG DEAL IS I WAS SITTING THERE LAST

85
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,703
SO... IT'S MY SEAT.

86
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,706
WELL, ACTUALLY, THE LAST PLACE YOU WERE SITTING

87
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,208
WAS IN THERE, SO...

88
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,210
LOOK, YOU GUYS, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT?

89
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,211
IT DOESN'T MATTER

90
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,713
BECAUSE YOU BOTH HAVE TO GO GET DRESSED

91
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,715
BEFORE THE BIG VEIN IN MY HEAD POPS, SO...

92
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,217
ALL RIGHT, ROSS, I JUST HAVE

93
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,219
TO DO ONE THING REALLY QUICKLY.

94
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,220
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

95
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,721
GET UP!!

96
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,223
HI. HEY.

97
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,226
OOH, PHOEBE, YOU LOOK GREAT.

98
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,728
ALL RIGHT ALREADY.

99
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,231
OOH, ARE YOU GOING TO DO MAGIC?

100
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,735
THAT'S THAT'S FUNNY. CHANGE.

101
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,736
HANG ON A SECOND, I JUST GOT IN.

102
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,737
LOOK, I DON'T CARE.

103
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,738
IT STARTS AT 8:00.

104
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,739
WE CAN'T BE LATE.

105
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,741
AND WE COULD NOT, WOULD NOT

106
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,243
WANT TO WAIT.

107
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,744
LOOK, OUR TABLE IS DOWN IN FRONT, OKAY?

108
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,746
MY BOSS IS GOING TO BE THERE.

109
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,249
EVERYONE WILL SEE IF WE ARRIVE AFTER IT STARTS.

110
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,251
HAS SOMEBODY BEEN DRINKING MY FAT?

111
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,253
YOU GUYS, DOES THIS LOOK LIKE SOMETHING

112
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,756
THE GIRLFRIEND OF A PALEONTOLOGIST WOULD WEAR?

113
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,757
I DON'T KNOW.

114
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,259
YOU MIGHT BE THE FIRST ONE.

115
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,260
 HEY, RACH

116
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,761
DID YOU CHECK THE MACHINE?

117
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,762
UH, NO.

118
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,264
WAIT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

119
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,266
THIS IS THE OUTFIT THAT MAKES MY CALVES LOOK FAT.

120
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,267
NEVER MIND.

121
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:31,771
WELL, JOEY

122
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,274
I WROTE A LITTLE SONG TODAY.

123
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,775
IT'S CALLED "GET UP."

124
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,277
GEE, YOU KNOW, I I JUST...

125
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,280
I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING I COULD DO TO HELP YOU.

126
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,283
?? GET UP, GET UP, GET UP, GET UP GET UP, GET UP, GET UP ??

127
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,784
?? GET UP, GET UP, GET UP... ?? ALL RIGHT!

128
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,786
ALL RIGHT, YOU CAN HAVE THE CHAIR.

129
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,288
REALLY?

130
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,290
OH, MY... WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?

131
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,791

132
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,793

133
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,794
 Hi, it's me.

134
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,296
I'm coming over now.

135
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,797
Hey, what if I'm

136
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,300
already there when you're playing this message?

137
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,301
IS THAT TOO SPOOKY?

138
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,802

139
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,305
 Hi, Rach, are you there?

140
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,307
It's me. Pick up.

141
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,308
Rachel? Rach?

142
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,310
WHAT?

143
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,312
NEVER MIND.

144
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,813

145
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,315
Hi, Rach. It's your sister.

146
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,817
Did you ever sleep with Donnie Mazzio?

147
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,820
Because last night, he kept shouting, "Two for two."

148
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,822
ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT ME TO GET DRESSED

149
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,327
OR DO YOU WANT TO HEAR A REALLY LONG STORY ABOUT THE SENIOR HAYRIDE?

150
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,330
ARE YOU ONLY ASKING HIM? BECAUSE I...

151
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,834

152
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,336
Monica, it's Richard.

153
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,837
Call me.

154
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,842
I IS, IS THAT MESSAGE OLD OR NEW?

155
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,345
OLD OR NEW, OLD OR NEW?!

156
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,846
IT'S OLD, IT'S DEFINITELY OLD.

157
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,848
DIDN'T YOU HEAR THE DOUBLE BEEP?

158
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,350
WELL, WHAT IF IT'S NEW?

159
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,851
I MEAN, WE AGREED NOT TO TALK.

160
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,353
HE COULD HAVE SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT TO SAY.

161
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,854
SHOULDN'T I CALL HIM BACK?

162
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,857
HONEY, YOU DID CALL HIM BACK, BECAUSE IT'S REALLY OLD.

163
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,359
YEAH, SEE... MON, LISTEN, LISTEN.

164
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,362
WHEN CAROL AND I BROKE UP, I WENT THROUGH THE SAME THING

165
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,863
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I DID?

166
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,365
HUH?

167
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,367
I GOT DRESSED.

168
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,372
REALLY, REALLY QUICKLY, OKAY?

169
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,374
THERE WE GO, THERE WE GO.

170
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,376
 YOU KNOW WHAT?

171
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,377
OKAY, FINE. DON'T GET UP.

172
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,878
YOU JUST SIT RIGHT THERE.

173
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,380
I JUST HOPE YOU DON'T MIND

174
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,881
YOU KNOW, MY HAND RIGHT HERE.

175
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,383
OH, NOT TOUCHING.

176
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,384
CAN'T GET MAD.

177
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,385
NOT TOUCHING.

178
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,386
CAN'T GET MAD.

179
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,388
NOT TOUCHING, CAN'T GET MAD.

180
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,389
OH..!

181
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,391
OH, MY GOD, YOU...

182
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,393
ROTTEN BOYS!

183
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,394
SORRY, PHOEBE.

184
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,395
I'M SO SORRY.

185
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,896
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

186
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:37,897
NO, NO, DON'T RUB IT.

187
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,900
WHAT GETS OUT HUMMUS, WHAT GETS OUT HUMMUS?!

188
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,403
MONICA, MONICA, YOU KNOW WHAT GETS OUT HUMMUS.

189
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:47,907
IF IT IS A NEW MESSAGE, WHAT IS HE CALLING TO SAY?

190
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,910
OKAY, THANKS. YEAH, I'LL TRY THAT.

191
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,414
MAYBE HE'S CALLING TO SAY YOU'RE OBSESSIVE AND CRAZY?

192
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,915
SO, SHOULD I CALL HIM BACK?

193
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,418
NO! NO! NO!

194
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,920
NO! NO! NO!

195
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,922
OKAY... DO THESE MATCH?

196
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,424
YES, THEY DEFINITELY MATCH.

197
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,925
THEY DON'T MATCH.

198
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,928
OH!

199
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,931
WHAT? THEY DIDN'T MATCH.

200
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,433
ALL RIGHT, FINE. YOU KNOW WHAT?

201
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,934
WE'LL BOTH SIT IN THE CHAIR.

202
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,935
FINE WITH ME.

203
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,941
I AM SO COMFORTABLE.

204
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,444
ME TOO.

205
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,946
IN FACT, I THINK I MIGHT BE

206
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,448
A LITTLE TOO COMFORTABLE.

207
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,949
ALL RIGHT.

208
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,451

209
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,952
OKAY, LOOK

210
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,953
WE HAVE 19 MINUTES, OKAY?

211
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,955
CHANDLER, I WANT YOU TO GO AND CHANGE, OKAY?

212
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,458
AND THEN WHEN YOU COME BACK, JOEY WILL GO CHANGE

213
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,460
AND HE'LL HAVE VACATED THE CHAIR, OKAY?

214
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,462
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

215
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,963
FINE. I'M GOING

216
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,466
BUT WHEN I GET BACK, IT'S CHAIR CITY

217
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,468
AND I'M THE GUY WHO'S...

218
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,470
SITTING IN A CHAIR.

219
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,971
 IS THIS A LITTLE TOO...?

220
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,974
PHEEBS, WHAT HAPPENED?

221
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,476
HUMMUS. I GOT THE HUMMUS.

222
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:57,477
OH... HONEY, WELL

223
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:58,978
WE'LL FIND YOU SOMETHING.

224
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,980
DO YOU WANT TO WEAR MY BLACK JACKET?

225
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,982
THAT WON'T GO WITH THIS DRESS, THOUGH.

226
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,983
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT. WELL, WE'LL FIND YOU SOMETHING.

227
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,485
LET'S JUST GET YOU OUT OF THAT.

228
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,986
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

229
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,987
NOT OUT OF THAT.

230
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:08,988
NOT OUT OF CLOTHES.

231
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,491
MONICA, CAN PHOEBE BORROW YOUR GREEN DRESS?

232
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,492
I CALLED HIM.

233
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,493

234
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,494
YES.

235
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,497
WELL, I GOT HIS MACHINE, AND I LEFT A MESSAGE

236
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,999
BUT IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW

237
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,502
IT WAS, LIKE, A CASUAL, BREEZY MESSAGE.

238
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,003
IT WAS BREEZY.

239
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,005
OH, GOD, WHAT IF IT WASN'T BREEZY?

240
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,007
WELL, HOW COULD IT NOT BE BREEZY?

241
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,510
NO, BECAUSE YOU'RE IN SUCH A BREEZY PLACE.

242
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,011
YOU KNOW, I GOT IT.

243
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,513
I WILL PLAY MY MESSAGE FOR YOU GUYS

244
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,515
AND YOU CAN TELL ME IF IT'S BREEZY ENOUGH.

245
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,017
BUT, MONICA, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT?

246
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,019
I KNOW THE CODE TO HIS ANSWERING MACHINE.

247
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,523
OKAY, MON, I REALLY DON'T THINK THIS IS THE...

248
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,024
OKAY, YOU'RE DIALING.

249
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,025
YOU ARE DIALING.

250
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,538
WHAT'S GOING ON?

251
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,040
MONICA'S BEEPING INTO RICHARD'S MACHINE.

252
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,041
IS SHE CRAZY?

253
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,043
LIKE A STRAW.

254
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,046
REMEMBER CRAZY STRAWS?

255
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,048
Hi, this is Richard.

256
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,050
Please leave a message at the tone.

258
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,054
You have two new messages.

259
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,556
WOW, WHAT A COOL JOB.

260
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,058
YOU HAVE TWO NEW MESSAGES.

261
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,563
PLEASE PASS THE PIE.

263
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:25,565
Hi, it's Monica.

264
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,066
I'm just checking in

265
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,068
because I got this message from you

266
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,571
and I didn't know if it was old or new or what

267
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,573
so, I'm just checking.

268
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,575
So, let me know.

269
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,076
Or don't. Whatever.

270
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,078
I'm breezy.

271
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,081
HEY, YOU CAN'T SAY YOU'RE BREEZY.

272
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,083
THAT TOTALLY NEGATES THE BREEZY.

273
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,084

274
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,086
 Hola. It's me.

275
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,088
Yesterday was really fun.

276
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,592
Call me about this weekend, okay?

277
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,597
NOW, SHE SOUNDED BREEZY.

278
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,106
HE'S SEEING SOMEONE.

279
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,108
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S SEEING SOMEONE.

280
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,610
MONICA, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

281
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,611
WELL, WHOSE VOICE WAS THAT?

282
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,613
MAYBE IT WAS HIS SISTER'S, YOU KNOW?

283
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,614
MAYBE IT WAS HIS DAUGHTER'S.

284
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,115
MICHELLE.

285
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,116
OF COURSE!

286
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,117
IT WAS MICHELLE!

287
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,119
DID IT SOUND LIKE MICHELLE?

288
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,621
I, UH...

289
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,623
I CANNOT REMEMBER HER.

290
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,626
GREAT, GREAT.

291
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,627
IT'S STARTING TO RAIN.

292
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,629
THAT'LL MAKE IT EASIER TO GET A CAB.

293
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,130
IT WAS MICHELLE.

294
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,632
IT WAS DEFINITELY MICHELLE.

295
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,133
PHEEBS, YOU GO WITH MONICA.

296
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,635
TRY ON HER GREEN DRESS.

297
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,137
IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, YOU'RE WEARING MY GRAY SILK ONE.

298
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,639
OH, GOD, UNLESS I WEAR IT.

299
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,140
YOU DON'T... YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE WEARING?

300
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,643
HONEY, I'M JUST TRYING TO LOOK NICE FOR YOUR BIG NIGHT.

301
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,646
YEAH, WHICH WE HAVE TO LEAVE FOR IN EXACTLY 12 MINUTES.

302
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,148
ALL RIGHT, COME ON. I'LL JUST PICK SOMETHING OUT FOR YOU.

303
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,150
LOOK, THERE, THERE. THAT LOOKS GOOD.

304
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,152
ROSS, THAT'S A TOWEL.

305
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:57,156
OKAY... YOU WILL NOTICE THAT I AM FULLY DRESSED.

306
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,660
I, IN TURN, HAVE NOTICED THAT YOU ARE NOT.

307
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,162
SO, IN THE WORDS OF A.A. MILNE

308
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,165
"GET OUT OF MY CHAIR, DILLHOLE."

309
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,668
OKAY.

310
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,176
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

311
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,679
YOU SAID I HAD TO GIVE YOU THE CHAIR.

312
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,181
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE CUSHIONS.

313
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,183
THE CUSHIONS ARE THE ESSENCE OF THE CHAIR.

314
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,185
THAT'S RIGHT!

315
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,186
I'M TAKING THE ESSENCE.

316
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,689
HO HO, HE'LL BE BACK.

317
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,192
HO HO, THERE'S NOBODY IN THE ROOM.

318
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,194
I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT IT LOOKED PRETTY.

319
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,697
ROSS, THAT WAS A HALLOWEEN COSTUME.

320
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,700
UNLESS YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO GO TO THIS THING AS LITTLE BO PEEP.

321
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,703
LOOK, I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE IT WITHOUT THAT INFLATABLE SHEEP.

322
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,706
YEAH, WHICH, BY THE WAY, CHANDLER, I WOULD LIKE BACK

323
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,708
ONE OF THESE DAYS.

324
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,210
OOH! RACH, GOOD.

325
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,713
LISTEN, ISN'T THIS PERFECT FOR ME?

326
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,714
OH, IT'S PERFECT

327
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,715
BUT NOT FOR TONIGHT.

328
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,217
WELL, NO. OF COURSE, NOT FOR TONIGHT.

329
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,219
NOT FOR TONIGHT? NOT FOR TONIGHT?

330
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,721
WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

331
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,723
NO, I'M SORRY. WE DIDN'T MEAN IT.

332
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,724
I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU.

333
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,725
BREATHE.

334
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,728
WE USED THEM AS PILLOWS WHEN WE WENT CAMPING.

335
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,229
WHAT?

336
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,232
THE SHEEP.

337
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:17,236
HEY, WHAT YOU DO ON YOUR OWN TIME...

338
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,240
WHERE'S MY UNDERWEAR?

339
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,742
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

340
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,744
COME ON. WHAT?

341
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,745
YOU TOOK HIS UNDERWEAR?

342
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,246
HE TOOK MY ESSENCE.

343
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,247
HOLD ON.

344
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,749
JOEY, WHY CAN'T YOU

345
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,251
JUST WEAR THE UNDERWEAR YOU'RE WEARING NOW?

346
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,754
BECAUSE I'M NOT WEARING ANY UNDERWEAR NOW.

347
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,758
OKAY. UM, THEN WHY DO YOU HAVE TO WEAR UNDERWEAR TONIGHT?

348
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,259
IT'S A RENTED TUX, OKAY?

349
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:44,263
I'M NOT GOING TO GO COMMANDO IN ANOTHER MAN'S FATIGUES.

350
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,765
WELL, THEN, IT LOOKS LIKE

351
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,267
SOMEBODY'S GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE

352
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,769
SOMEBODY BACK HIS CUSHIONS.

353
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,771
OKAY. YOU HIDE MY CLOTHES?

354
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,774
I'M GOING TO DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE TO YOU.

355
00:12:54,774 --> 00:13:00,279
WHAT, ARE YOU GOING TO SHOW ME MY CLOTHES?

356
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,283
HEY, OPPOSITE... IS OPPOSITE.

357
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,287
HE'S GOT NOTHING!

358
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,289
OKAY. I'M READY.

359
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,791

360
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,796
RACHEL DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING

361
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,797
THAT I LIKED, SO...

362
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,299
BUT SHE HAD THIS CHRISTMAS RIBBON.

363
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,300
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

364
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,802
I'LL BE POLITICAL.

365
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,303
WHAT ARE YOU SUPPORTING?

366
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,305
DUH. CHRISTMAS.

367
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,808
OKAY. HEY, THAT'S OKAY WITH ME.

368
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,311
TWO DOWN, AND I HAVE EXACTLY 12 MINUTES...

369
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,813
TWELVE...

370
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,815
MY WATCH STOPPED.

371
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:36,816
MY WATCH...

372
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,818
OKAY. SEE, THE DINOSAUR TAIL

373
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,820
ISN'T GOING AROUND ANYMORE.

374
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,821
WHAT TIME IS IT?

375
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,323
IT'S 7:33. I HAVE SEVEN MINUTES.

376
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,825
I HAVE SEVEN MINUTES.

377
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,827
OKAY, PHEEBS, QUICK-- WHICH SHOES SHOULD I WEAR, BLACK OR PURPLE?

378
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,829
JUST... JUST PICK ONE, OKAY?

379
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,830
OKAY, OKAY. THE BLACK.

380
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,331
BUT DO YOU HAVE BLACK

381
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,833
WITH LITTLE STRAPPIES?

382
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,836
YEAH, BUT THOSE REALLY GO BETTER WITH PANTS.

383
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,337
MAYBE I SHOULD WEAR PANTS.

384
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,339
YEAH, PANTS. WHAT... WHAT AN IDEA.

385
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,342
OR BETTER YET, HOW ABOUT YOU GO WITHOUT ANY PANTS?

386
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,344
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO TO ME

387
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,846
BUT JUST GET YOUR BUTT IN THERE

388
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,348
AND PICK OUT ANY SHOES THAT FIT YOUR FEET, OKAY?

389
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,350
NO, NO. I DON'T CARE IF THEY MATCH.

390
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,353
I DON'T CARE IF THEY MAKE YOUR ANKLES OR YOUR KNEES

391
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,855
OR YOUR EARLOBES LOOK FAT.

392
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:16,856
BUT I... NO, NO, NO.

393
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,357
JUST DO IT.

394
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,860
GO IN THERE, PICK SOMETHING OUT

395
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,361
SO WE CAN GO.

396
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,864
ALL RIGHT.

397
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,365
THANK YOU.

398
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,867
OKAY. I'VE GOT TO CALL MICHELLE.

399
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,369
I'VE GOT TO SEE IF THAT WAS HER VOICE OR NOT.

400
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,370
I JUST HAVE TO.

401
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,872
IT WAS. IT WAS HER VOICE.

402
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,875
MONICA, I THINK YOU'VE GONE OVER TO THE BAD PLACE.

403
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,879

404
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,881
 Hola.

405
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,882
Hello.

406
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,383
Hello?

407
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,887
OKAY. THAT WAS HER, RIGHT?

408
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,888
DEFINITELY, YEAH.

409
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,890
SO THERE YOU GO.

410
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,391
WE'RE OUT OF THE WOODS.

411
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,893
I THINK I'LL GET DRESSED NOW.

412
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,895

413
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,396
I'LL GET IT, OKAY.

414
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,900
HI. MONICA AND RACHEL'S.

415
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,401
YEAH. JUST A SECOND.

416
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,403
CAN I ASK WHO'S CALLING?

417
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,905
OH. OOH, IT'S MICHELLE. OOH!

418
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,909
SHE MUST HAVE THAT CALLER I.D. THING.

419
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,410
YOU SHOULD GET THAT.

420
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,415
UH... MICHELLE?

421
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,416
YEAH, THAT WAS ME.

422
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,419
UM, I DIALED YOUR NUMBER BY MISTAKE.

423
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,921
CAN YOU JUST TRY...

424
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,424
OH, YOU'RE SO SWEET!

425
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,427
YEAH, WE WERE A GREAT COUPLE.

426
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,429
I KNOW, I REALLY MISS HIM.

427
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,431
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

428
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,432
IT'S JUST...

429
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,434
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WEIRD?

430
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,936

431
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,438
DONALD DUCK NEVER WORE PANTS.

432
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,442
BUT WHENEVER HE'S GETTING OUT OF THE SHOWER

433
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,444
HE ALWAYS PUTS A TOWEL AROUND HIS WAIST.

434
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,950
I MEAN, WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?

435
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,951
SHH!

436
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,452
MICHELLE, I ONLY BEEPED IN

437
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,454
SO I COULD HEAR MY OWN MESSAGE.

438
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,455
I MEAN, THAT'S ALLOWED.

439
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,957
YUH HUH!

440
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,458
LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

441
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,960
I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT

442
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,962
IF YOU WOULDN'T TELL YOUR DAD ABOUT...

443
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,463
WHAT DO YOU MEAN

444
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,966
YOU DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THIS?

445
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,967
COME ON, WE'RE FRIENDS!

446
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,968

447
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,469
THAT BITCH ALWAYS HATED ME.

448
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,972
I'M CALLIN G HER BACK.

449
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,974
NO, NO. TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK.

450
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,975
OKAY, FINE.

451
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,476
OKAY.

452
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,478
SHE'S GOT A PHONE IN THERE, RIGHT?

453
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,981
OKAY, WE'RE ON IT, WE'RE ON IT.

454
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,489

455
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,490
UM...

456
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,992

457
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,994
I KNOW IT SAYS "BLACK TIE OPTIONAL"

458
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,497
BUT... THIS... THIS MAY BE PUSHING IT A LITTLE.

459
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,498
UM...

460
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,000
I'M NOT GOING TO GO.

461
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,502
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO?

462
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,005
NO. I THINK I'M GOING TO CATCH UP

463
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,507
ON MY CORRESPONDENCE.

464
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,509
HOW HOW, UM...

465
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,512
HOW CAN YOU NOT BE GOING?

466
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,014
I'M NOT GOING TO GO

467
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:59,518
SO I THINK THAT WILL ACCOMPLISH THE NOT GOING.

468
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,525
UM, YOU KNOW, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY...

469
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,527
WELL, EVER SINCE I WAS HUMILIATED

470
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,030
AND YELLED AT IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS

471
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,531
I'M JUST, I DON'T KNOW

472
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,034
NOT IN A VERY MUSEUM BENEFITY KIND OF MOOD.

473
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,535
RIGHT, OKAY, OKAY.

474
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,537
GOD, I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY I YELLED.

475
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,538
THAT'S FINE.

476
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,040
NO, BUT YOU'RE MAD.

477
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,542
I'M NOT MAD, I'M JUST NOT GOING.

478
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,543
YOU'RE NOT GOING.

479
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,544
RIGHT.

480
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,046
OKAY.

481
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,548
YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE TO GO, RIGHT?

482
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,549
MM HMM.

483
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,552
IS IT GOING TO BE LIKE I'M ABANDONING YOU

484
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,553
WHILE YOU'RE UPSET?

485
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,055
NO.

486
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,556
NO? BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT UPSET...

487
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,557
RIGHT.

488
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,059
...ABOUT THE YELLING?

489
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,060
RIGHT... AND THE HUMILIATING.

490
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,061
WELL, OF COURSE

491
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,063
THE HUMILIATING.

492
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,565
SO, SO, WE, WE'RE OKAY.

493
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,067
MM HMM.

494
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,068
RIGHT. WE'RE GOOD.

495
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,069
OKAY.

496
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,072
HONEY?

497
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,073
YES, ROSS.

498
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,074
I LOVE YOU.

499
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,075
MM HMM.

500
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,076
 GET AWAY

501
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,077
FROM THE PHONE!

502
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,079
OW!

503
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,581
SHE'S JUST GETTING DRESSED.

504
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,587
IS IT WRONG THAT I WAS TOTALLY AROUSED BY THAT?

505
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,598
OKAY, BUDDY BOY, HERE IT IS.

506
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:24,603
YOU HIDE MY CLOTHES, I'M WEARING EVERYTHING YOU OWN.

507
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,605
OH, MY GOD!

508
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:31,610
THAT IS SO NOT THE OPPOSITE OF TAKING SOMEBODY'S UNDERWEAR!

509
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,112
LOOK AT ME!

510
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,113
I'M CHANDLER!

511
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,614
COULD I BE WEARING

512
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,117
ANY MORE CLOTHES?

513
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,619
MAYBE IF I WASN'T GOING COMMANDO...

514
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,622

515
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,626
YEAH, WHOO! I TELL YOU, IT'S HOT WITH ALL THIS STUFF ON.

516
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,629
I... I BETTER NOT DO ANY, I DON'T KNOW, LUNGES.

517
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,133
OKAY, OKAY. ENOUGH, ENOUGH OF THE LUNGING.

518
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,135
NO, I'M SICK OF THIS, OKAY?

519
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,138
I'VE HAD IT UP TO HERE WITH YOU TWO.

520
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,639
NEITHER OF YOU CAN

521
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,141
COME TO THE PARTY.

522
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,642
GEEZ, WHAT A BABY.

523
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,144
YEAH, ROSS. WAY TO RUIN IT.

524
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,146
I WAS JUST GOING TO GO GET DRESSED.

525
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,647
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T CARE.

526
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,649
THE ONLY PERSON I CARED ABOUT GETTING DRESSED

527
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,652
IS THE ONE PERSON THAT SAYS SHE'S NOT EVEN GOING TO GO.

528
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,154
LOOK, RACH, I'M SORRY, OKAY?

529
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,156
LOOK, I WAS A JERK, OKay?

530
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,157
I'M SORRY I YELLED

531
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,658
I WANT YOU THERE.

532
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,659
I NEED YOU THERE.

533
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,663
WHAT CAN I DO TO SHOW YOU HOW MUCH...

534
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,165
HOW MUCH I WANT YOU

535
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,666
TO BE THERE?

536
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,169
YOU COULD DRINK THE FAT.

537
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,672
HI. WELCOME TO AN ADULT CONVERSATION.

538
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,176
NO, NO, NO. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

539
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,178
THAT ACTUALLY, UH, THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING.

540
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,180
WHAT?

541
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,682
I THINK YOU SHOULD DRINK THE FAT.

542
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,684
YAY.

543
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,188
OKAY.

544
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,691
OKAY, IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO SHOW YOU

545
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,193
HOW MUCH YOU MEAN TO ME

546
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,694
AND HOW MUCH I WANT YOU THERE

547
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,695
THEN THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.

548
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,198
LET ME GET YOU ANOTHER GLASS.

549
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,199
THAT'S BEEN SITTING OUT.

550
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,700
I THINK THIS WILL BE FINE.

551
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,705
OKAY, VANILLA MILK SHAKE, JUST A VANILLA MILK SHAKE...

552
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,208
WITH CHICKEN BITS FLOATING IN IT.

553
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,213
CHEERS.

554
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,715
NO, NO, NO. I'LL GO, I'LL GO.

555
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,217
YOU WILL?

556
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,220
YOU WERE REALLY GOING TO DO THAT, WEREN'T YOU?

557
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,721
WELL, YEAH.

558
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,723
YOU WERE GOING TO DRINK THE FAT!

559
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,730
LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE HE'LL DO.

560
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,732
HOW ABOUT INSTEAD, YOU GO GET CHANGED?

561
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,734
YOU, GIVE HIM BACK HIS UNDERWEAR.

562
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,735
I'M GONNA GO GET A CAB.

563
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,737
I WANT EVERYONE DOWNSTAIRS IN TWO MINUTES.

564
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,239
MONICA!

565
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,242
STOP IT! STOP IT!

566
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,248
ROSS WENT TO GET A CAB

567
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,249
SO WE CAN ALL...

568
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,750
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

569
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,751
NO, MONICA, NO!

570
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,753

571
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,256
Hi, this is Richard.

572
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,258

573
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,760
You have three new messages.

574
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,262

575
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,264
NOT ANYMORE.

576
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,265
Message erased.

577
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,767

578
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,271
To record your message, begin speaking at the tone.

579
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,772

580
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,773
HI, UH, RICHARD.

581
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,774
IT'S MONICA.

582
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,777
LISTEN, I DID SOMETHING KIND OF CRAZY TONIGHT.

583
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,780
MAYBE I'M GETTING MY PERIOD OR SOMETHING, I DON'T KNOW.

584
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,284
ANYWAY, UH, I... I BEEPED INTO YOUR MACHINE

585
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,787
AND I HEARD THIS MESSAGE THAT FREAKED ME OUT

586
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,289
AND... YOU KNOW WHAT?

587
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,291
MICHELLE WILL TELL YOU THE REST.

588
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,792
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

589
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,794
AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN JUST FORGET THE WHOLE THING.

590
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,296
OKAY, BYE.

591
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,798

592
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,802
Your outgoing message has now been changed.

593
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,304
OUTGOING?

594
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,306
DID THAT SAY OUTGOING?!

595
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,807
NOT OUTGOING!

596
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,309

597
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,311
Hi, uh, Richard.

598
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,312
It's Monica.

599
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,814
Listen, I did something kind of crazy tonight.

600
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,316
Maybe I'm getting

601
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,817
my period or something.

602
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,319
NO! I don't know.

603
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,820
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

604
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,821
I DON'T KNOW!

605
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:03,822
Good-bye.

606
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,824
NO!

607
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,826
OKAY.

608
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,828
OKAY, I'VE GOT TWO CABS

609
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,829
AND NO PEOPLE.

610
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,331
GO! GO! GO!

611
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,333
MAYBE WE COULD CALL THE PHONE COMPANY.

612
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,335
MAYBE THEY COULD CHANGE THE MESSAGE.

613
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,837
MAYBE THEY COULD CHANGE HIS NUMBER.

614
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,840
I THINK AFTER THIS, HE'LL BE DOING THAT HIMSELF.

615
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,842
RACHEL?

616
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,847
WOW.

617
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,349
YOU...

618
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,352
OH, YOU LOOK... WOW.

619
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,855
AND I STILL HAVE ABOUT FIVE SECONDS TO SPARE.

620
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,358
OH...

621
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,864
OKAY. THAT WAS ABOUT SEVEN SECONDS.

622
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,366
SO WE'RE A LITTLE LATE.

623
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:48,867
COME ON.

624
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,369
NO. OH.

625
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,870
OH, AND, UH...

626
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,871
BY THE WAY...

627
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:53,872
WHAT?

628
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,374
I'M GOING COMMANDO, TOO.

629
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,875
OH.

630
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,887
 SO, I SAID, "WHO ARE YOU, CRO MAGNUM P.I.?"

631
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,890

632
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,891
DR. GELLER...

633
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,892
OH...

634
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,894
SHERMAN WHITFIELD, LONDON INSTITUTE.

635
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,896
WOW. WHAT A PLEASURE.

636
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:21,400
WELL, I HAVE TO TELL YOU I WAS QUITE IMPRESSED WITH YOUR PAPER

637
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,401
ON PRE CRETACEOUS FOSSILS.

638
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,404
YES. IT CONFIRMED EVERYTHING I'D WRITTEN.

639
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,905
EXCUSE ME.

640
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,906
HI.

641
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:28,907
YES?

642
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,910
YOU'RE KIND OF SITTING IN MY SEAT.

643
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,913
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOUR SEAT?

644
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,416
I MEAN, I WAS SITTING THERE.

645
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,417
BUT YOU GOT UP.

646
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,419
BUT I NEVER LEFT THE ROOM.

647
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,422
BUT YOU LEFT THE CHAIR AREA.

648
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,424
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

649
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,426
GIVE ME YOUR UNDERWEAR.
