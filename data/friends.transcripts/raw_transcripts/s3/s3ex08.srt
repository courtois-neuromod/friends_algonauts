1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,006
ONE OF MY SPECIAL HOMEMADE BROWNIES?

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,507
 I WILL HAVE ONE.

3
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,509
OH! OH!

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,012
YEAH, I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE ONE. THAT'S OKAY.

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,513
NO, NO, IT'S JUST MY TOOTH.

6
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,514
ALL RIGHT.

7
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,016
I'LL HAVE ONE.

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,518
SO WHAT'S THE MATTER, YOU NEED A DENTIST?

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,520
I'VE GOT A GOOD ONE.

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,522
THANKS. I HAVE A GOOD ONE, TOO.

11
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,025
I JUST... I CAN'T SEE HIM.

12
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,526
SEE, THAT IS THE PROBLEM

13
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,028
WITH INVISIBLE DENTISTS.

14
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,529
IT'S VERY UNSETTLING

15
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,032
TO SEE ALL THOSE METAL TOOLS

16
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,034
JUST, YOU KNOW, FLYING AROUND.

17
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,037
WHY? WHY CAN'T YOU GO TO HIM?

18
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:41,041
BECAUSE... EVERY TIME I GO TO THE DENTIST

19
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,542
SOMEBODY DIES.

20
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,044
THAT IS SO WEIRD

21
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,546
BECAUSE EVERY TIME I GO TO THE DENTIST

22
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,049
I LOOK DOWN THE HYGIENIST'S BLOUSE.

23
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,550
 PHOEBE...

24
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,553
WHAT, UM... WHAT?

25
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,056
YEAH, YEAH. FIRST THERE WAS MY AUNT MARY

26
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,058
AND THEN THERE WAS JOHN, MY MAILMAN

27
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,061
AND THEN MY COWBOY FRIEND, ALBINO BOB.

28
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,064
AND ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ACTUALLY DIED?

29
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,566
YES. WHILE I WAS IN THE CHAIR.

30
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,069
THAT'S WHY I TAKE SUCH GOOD CARE OF MY TEETH NOW.

31
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,570
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT ABOUT ORAL HYGIENE.

32
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,072
I FLOSS TO SAVE LIVES.

33
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,573
PHEEBS, COME ON.

34
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,075
YOU DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

35
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,077
THESE PEOPLE JUST HAPPENED TO DIE

36
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,079
WHEN YOU WENT TO THE DENTIST.

37
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,580
IT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE.

38
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,082
WELL, TELL THAT TO THEM.

39
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,583
OH, YOU CAN'T! THEY'RE DEAD!

53
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:13,633
THANKS, GUNTHER.

54
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:14,634
HI. HI.

55
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,137
UM, COULD I GET A NAPKIN, TOO?

56
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,140
OH, LIKE YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE EVERYTHING.

57
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,643
OW! OW!

58
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,145
 PHOEBE, YOU'RE IN PAIN.

59
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,647
WOULD YOU JUST GO TO THE DENTIST?

60
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,149
JUST GO.

61
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,650
ALL RIGHT, FINE, FINE.

62
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,153
BUT IF YOU'RE MY NEXT VICTIM, DON'T COME BACK AS A POLTERGEIST

63
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,155
WHO, LIKE, SUCKS ME INTO THE TV SET.

64
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,656
I PROMISE.

65
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,658
ALTHOUGH DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU CAN'T VISIT.

66
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,163
HEY, IS CHANDLER HERE?

67
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,666
NO. NO, HE'S NOT.

68
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,670
YOU GUYS, JOEY JUST SAW JANICE

69
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,672
KISSING HER EX HUSBAND.

70
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,174
OH! WHAT?

71
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,675
SO, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

72
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,677
I MEAN, HOW HOW ARE YOU GOING TO TELL CHANDLER?

73
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,179
WELL, I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT

74
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,182
AND I THINK THE BEST WAY WOULD BE... TO NOT.

75
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,683
 JOEY, YOU CAN'T KEEP THIS TO YOURSELF.

76
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,186
IF YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS, YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM.

77
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,688
IT'LL KILL HIM. I MEAN, IT'LL JUST KILL HIM.

78
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,691
WELL, YOU COULD WAIT TILL I GO TO THE DENTIST.

79
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,193
MAYBE I'LL KILL HIM.

80
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,198
OOH! UGLY NAKED GUY

81
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,699
IS USING HIS NEW HAMMOCK.

82
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,702
IT'S LIKE A PLAY DOH FAT FACTORY.

83
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,204
WELL, I'M GOING TO THE DENTIST

84
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,705
SO LISTEN, OKAY?

85
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,207
JUST BE ON THE LOOKOUT

86
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,210
FOR ANYTHING THAT THAT THAT YOU COULD FALL INTO

87
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,712
OR THAT CAN FALL ON YOU

88
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,214
OR...

89
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,715
OR JUST LOOK OUT!

90
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,717
OKAY, AND, UM...

91
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,719
I ALSO JUST WANT TO...

92
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,224
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU ALL THAT, UM...

93
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,227

94
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,728
OKAY, I HAVE A PROBLEM.

95
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,731
I HAVE TO GO IN TO WORK FOR A FEW HOURS.

96
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,234
SOME KIDS MESSED UP THE HOMO SAPIEN DISPLAY.

97
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,735
WHAT DID THEY DO?

98
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,238
WELL, THEY PAINTED OVER THE WORD "SAPIEN"

99
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,239
FOR ONE THING.

100
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,740
THEN THEY...

101
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,243
REARRANGED THE FIGURES.

102
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,245
LET'S JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT.

103
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,747
DO YOU WANT ME TO WATCH BEN FOR YOU?

104
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,749
YES. THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO ASK. THANK YOU.

105
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,751
WHOA, WAIT-- HELLO? WHAT ABOUT ME?

106
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,755
YOU... YOU WANT TO WATCH BEN.

107
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,760
YES... THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

108
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,262
NO, I JUST ASKED MONICA

109
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,764
BECAUSE I KNOW HOW EMPTY HER LIFE IS.

110
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,771
HEY, ROSS, I GOT A SCIENCE QUESTION.

111
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:37,277
IF THE HOMO SAPIENS WERE, IN FACT, HOMO SAPIENS...

112
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,778
ALL RIGHT?

113
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,780
IS THAT WHY THEY'RE EXTINCT?

114
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,787
JOEY, HOMO SAPIENS ARE PEOPLE.

115
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,289
HEY, I'M NOT JUDGING.

116
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,791
I'M JUST ASKING.

117
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,794
LOOK, BENNY. SPOON.

118
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,296
SPOON.

119
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,298
COME ON.

120
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,799
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

121
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,301
I THINK HE'S BORED.

122
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,304
HERE. BEN, YOU WANT TO PLAY THE AIRPLANE GAME?

123
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,805
YOU WANT TO SHOW RACHEL?

124
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,308
COME HERE. YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING FUN?

125
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,809
OKAY... WHEE!

126
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,311
OH!

127
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,313
WHEE!

128
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,315
OH... WHEE!

129
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,817

130
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,320
YOU'RE SO BRAVE.

131
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,822
YOU'RE SO BRAVE. YES, YOU ARE.

132
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,823
YOU'RE SO BRAVE.

133
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,824
OKAY.

134
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,825
HONEY, HE'S FINE.

135
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,327
LET'S JUST PUT HIM DOWN.

136
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,329
COME HERE, BABE. YES, YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD BOY.

137
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,332
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO HIM?!

138
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,834
ROSS TRUSTED ME. WHAT IS HE GOING TO SAY?!

139
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,836
HE WON'T SAY ANYTHING BECAWE'RE NOT GOING TO TELL HIM.

140
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,338
WE'RE NOT? NO, WE'RE NOT.

141
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,839
ALL RIGHT, I LIKE THAT.

142
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,840
OKAY.

143
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,342
OKAY, SO WE'RE OKAY.

144
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,843
WE'RE OKAY, WE'RE OKAY, AREN'T WE?

145
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,345
NO, WE'RE NOT OKAY. WE'RE NOT OKAY.

146
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,846
THERE'S A BUMP. THERE'S A BUMP.

147
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:47,847
LOOK, THERE'S A BUMP.

148
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,849
OH, MY GOD. WELL, PU SH IT IN! PUSH IT IN!

149
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,852
I CANNOT PUSH IT IN!

150
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,355
OKAY, WE'RE GOING TO NEED A DISTRACTION.

151
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,356
OKAY.

152
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,357
THAT'S IT.

153
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,858
I GOT IT! OKAY.

154
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,360
THE SECOND THAT ROSS WALKS IN THAT DOOR

155
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,362
I WANT YOU TO TAKE HIM BACK TO YOUR BEDROOM

156
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,364
AND YOU DO WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU DO

157
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,365
THAT MAKES HIM GO, "REEE"!

158
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,869
OR...

159
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,372
WE COULD PUT A HAT ON HIS HEAD.

160
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,373
A HAT! YES!

161
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,874
WE NEED A HAT.

162
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,376
WE NEED A HAT.

163
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,377
WHERE ARE WE GOING TO FIND A TINY, LITTLE HAT?

164
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,378
OH, OH, OH!

165
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,879
I'LL GET RAINY DAY BEAR!

166
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,881
BECAUSE HE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO?

167
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,883
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE A GENIUS!

168
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,885
OH, GOD. IT'S KIND OF SEWN ON, THOUGH.

169
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,387
GIVE IT, GIVE IT!

170
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,888
OH! OH!

171
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,395
OH, IT'S JUST LIKE A BLOODBATH IN HERE TODAY.

172
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,401
HEY, HOLD ON A SECOND.

173
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,902
HOLD ON A SECOND.

174
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,905
DO YOU THINK THESE PEARLS ARE NICE?

175
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,908
I'D REALLY PREFER A MOUNTAIN BIKE.

176
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,910
JANICE'S BIRTHDAY IS COMING UP.

177
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,413
I WANT TO GET HER SOMETHING SPECIAL.

178
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,915
COME IN HERE WITH ME.

179
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,917
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WAIT. WHOA.

180
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,421
YOU, UH... YOU WANT TO GET HER SOMETHING SPECIAL

181
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,922
GET HER FLOWERS, GET HER CANDY.

182
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,924
GET HER GUM. GIRLS LOVE GUM.

183
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,426
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

184
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,429
"DEAR JANICE, HAVE A HUBBA BUBBA BIRTHDAY."

185
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,932
I WOULD LIKE TO GET HER SOMETHING SERIOUS.

186
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,435
OH, YOU WANT SOMETHING SERIOUS.

187
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,936
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO

188
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,938
YOU SHOULD GET HER ONE OF THOSE, UM...

189
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,440
BARIUM ENEMAS.

190
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,444
THOSE ARE DEAD SERIOUS.

191
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,448
AND YOU KNOW SHE'LL NEVER GET ONE FOR HERSELF.

192
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,950
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I'M GOING TO GO IN HERE

193
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,453
AND YOU DON'T BUY ME ANYTHING EVER.

194
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,455
NO, NO, YOU CAN'T! YOU CAN'T, OKAY? YOU CAN'T.

195
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,457
YOU CAN'T BUY HER PEARLS. YOU JUST CAN'T.

196
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,958
YOU CAN'T, YOU CAN'T, YOU CAN'T.

197
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,460
WHY NOT?

198
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,964
OH, GOD. UH... OKAY.

199
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:45,965
HERE'S THE THING...

200
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,467

201
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,468
THIS IS THE THING...

202
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:49,969
OKAY, THE THING IS...

203
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:50,970
WHAT IS THE THING? OKAY.

204
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,475
I WENT DOWN TO THE MATTRESS KING SHOWROOM AND...

205
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,479
AND I SAW JANICE KISSING HER EX HUSBAND.

206
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,481
WHAT?

207
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,484
THEY WERE IN HIS OFFICE.

208
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,988
WELL, SHE... SHE WOULDN'T DO THAT.

209
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,490
SHE'S SHE'S WITH ME.

210
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,492
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN, I SAW IT.

211
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,494
WELL, YOU'RE WRONG, OKAY? YOU'RE WRONG.

212
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,496
I'M NOT WRONG.

213
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,997
I WISH I WAS.

214
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,002
I'M SORRY.

215
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,006
I BET THAT BARIUM ENEMA

216
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,508
DOESN'T SOUND SO BAD NOW, HUH?

217
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,012
IT JUST MAKES MORE SENSE AS AN ENSEMBLE.

218
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,514
BESIDES, IT TAKES

219
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,515
THE FOCUS OFF THE HAT.

220
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,016

221
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,017
NO... OH!

222
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,019
YOU'RE ALIVE! YOU'RE ALIVE!

223
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,522
SEE, PHEEBS?

224
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,524
I PROMISED YOU NO ONE WOULD DIE, DIDN'T I?

225
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,526
YEAH, WELL, WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT. CAN I USE YOUR PHONE?

226
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,027
I WANT TO CALL EVERYONE I KNOW.

227
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,529
SURE. WE HAVE NO MONEY.

228
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,530
GO AHEAD.

229
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,533
HEY, YOU'RE NOT DEAD!

230
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,034
OKAY, SEE YOU.

231
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,038
MONKA.

232
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,039
OH, MY GOD.

233
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,041
HE JUST SAID MY NAME.

234
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,042
DID YOU HEAR?

235
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,043
YEAH.

236
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,545
MONKA BANG.

237
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,549

238
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,051
OKAY, I HEARD THAT.

239
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,553
DID HE JUST SAY, "MONICA BANG"?

240
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,054
UH HUH.

241
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,055
OH, MY GOD!

242
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,057
HE'S GOING TO RAT ME OUT!

243
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,058
MONKA BANG.

244
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,060
OH!

245
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,564
SWEETIE! SWEETIE, YOU NEED TO STOP SAYING THAT, NOW.

246
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,065
THAT'S NO BIG DEAL.

247
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,067
IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH MENTIONING.

248
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,069
YOU SEE, WE ALL DO IT ALL THE TIME.

249
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,571
SEE? WATCH THIS.

250
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,572
BEN! BEN! BEN!

251
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,574
OW! MONICA BANG.

252
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,075
EVERYBODY BANG.

253
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,076
BEN BANG.

254
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,578
RACHEL BANG.

255
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,580
BANG, RACHEL. BANG!

256
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,581
OKAY.

257
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,082
OH, ISN'T IT FUN?

258
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,584
LOOK AT THAT.

259
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,085
WE ALL DO IT.

260
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,587
OKAY, I'M STOPPING NOW.

261
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,088
YOU OKAY?

262
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,089
OH, YEAH.

263
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,591
YOU KNOW, IF IT'S NOT A HEADBOARD

264
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,092
IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT.

265
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,105
HOW'S MY BING A LING?

266
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,610
UH... I DON'T KNOW.

267
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,613
Y YOU TELL ME.

268
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,615
ANYTHING YOU, UH...

269
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,116
WANT TO TELL ME?

270
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,619
BECAUSE IF YOU... YOU SHOULD...

271
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,621
IF YOU'D... TELL ME.

272
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:26,125
WHY ARE YOUR EYES SO WIDE?

273
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,127
YOU TELL ME.

274
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,130
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I WAS JUST FOOLING AROUND WITH MY EX.

275
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,632
OH, NO, NO! NO, NO, NO, NO!

276
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,133
THAT WAS YOU!

277
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,635
OH, MY GOD!

278
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,636
ALL RIGHT.

279
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,638
HOW DID YOU KNOW? JOEY TOLD ME.

280
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,139
HE SAW YOU TWO KISSING.

281
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,140
IN THE PARK?

282
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,143
NO. IN HIS OFFICE.

283
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,645
HOW MANY KISSES WERE THERE?

284
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,146
JUST THOSE TWO!

285
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,147
WH WH WHY?!

286
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,149
W WHY? WHY WHY WAS THERE KISSING?

287
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,651
THERE SHOULD BE NO KISSING.

288
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,152
OH, I'M SORRY, HONEY.

289
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,655
I'M SO, SO... HAH!

290
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,656
I'M SO, SO SORRY.

291
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,157
I JUST... HAH!

292
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,659

00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,661
OH, WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT I...

294
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,662
I CAN'T BREATHE!

295
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,164
CAN YOU GET ME A BAG OR SOMETHING?

296
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,666
YEAH.

297
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,668
HERE, HERE.

298
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,169
THERE.

299
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,672

300
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,673
IT'S THE RECEIPT.

301
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,675
I'LL TAKE IT.

302
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,176
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

303
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,178
I'VE GOT TO KNOW--

304
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,182
ARE YOU FINISHED WITH ME?

305
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,184

306
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,687
ARE YOU FINISHED WITH HIM?

307
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,189

308
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,693
DO YOU STILL LOVE HIM?

309
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,195

310
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,197
DO YOU STILL LOVE ME?

311
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,199

312
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,701
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

313
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,705
I'M GOING TO NEED AN ACTUAL ANSWER HERE, OKAY?

314
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,207
SO, WHICH IS IT--

315
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,209
HIM OR ME?

316
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,713

317
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,220
I DON'T KNOW.

318
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,724
OKAY, IF YOU'RE ALIVE

319
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,727
YOU ANSWER YOUR PHONE!

320
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,234
OKAY, BEN, I WON'T TELL YOUR DADDY

321
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,737
THAT YOU HAD ICE CREAM BEFORE DINNER

322
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,238
IF YOU WON'T TELL HIM

323
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,741
ABOUT OUR LITTLE BONKING INCIDENT.

324
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,243
MONICA, NUMBER ONE, I DON'T THINK BEN

325
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,245
UNDERSTANDS THE CONCEPT OF BRIBERY.

326
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,246
AND NUMBER TWO...

327
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,248

328
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:30,750
WHAT?

329
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,252
YOU SAID "NUMBER TWO."

330
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,757
I ALSO SAID "NUMBER ONE."

331
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,258
I KNOW.

332
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,761
I KNOW.

333
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,762
HEY, EVERYONE.

334
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,263
HI.

335
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,765
HOW'S MY LITTLE BOY?

336
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,266
 HE'S PERFECT, AREN'T YOU, BEN?

337
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,768
HE'S NEVER BEEN BETTER.

338
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,770
WHAT DID YOU DO, TAKE HIM WHALING?

339
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,774
MONKA.

340
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,275
OH, MY GOD.

341
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,777
HE JUST SAID YOUR NAME.

342
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,778
THAT'S GREAT.

343
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,779
GOOD JOB, BEN.

344
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,280
MONKA BANG.

345
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,783
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

346
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,786
THAT'S WHAT I'D SOUND LIKE IF I EXPLODED.

347
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,289
WHOO HOO! THE CURSE IS BROKEN.

348
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,292
I CALLED EVERYBODY I KNOW, AND EVERYONE IS ALIVE.

349
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,796
HUH.

350
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,797
WHAT?

351
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,300
UGLY NAKED GUY LOOKS AWFULLY STILL.

352
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,804

353
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,807
OH, MY GOD.

354
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,809
I KILLED HIM. I KILLED ANOTHER ONE.

355
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,811
AND THIS CURSE IS GETTING STRONGER, TOO--

356
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,813
TO BRING DOWN SOMETHING THAT BIG?

357
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,815
WELL, MAYBE HE'S JUST TAKING A NAP.

358
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,816
I'M TELLING YOU

359
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,318
HE HASN'T MOVED SINCE THIS MORNING.

360
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,820
WE SHOULD CALL SOMEBODY.

361
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,821
AND TELL THEM WHAT?

362
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,324
THAT THE NAKED GUY WE STARE AT ALL THE TIME ISN'T MOVING?

363
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,826
BUT WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUT IF HE IS ALIVE.

364
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,829
YEAH, BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT?

365
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,830
THERE'S NO WAY.

366
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,331
WELL, THERE IS ONE WAY.

367
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,332
HIS WINDOW'S OPEN.

368
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,334
I SAY... WE POKE HIM.

369
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,340
HEY.

370
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,341
YOU KNOW HOW WE SAVE

371
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,343
ALL THOSE CHOPSTICKS FOR NO REASON

372
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,845
WHEN WE GET CHINESE FOOD?

373
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,847
YEAH.

374
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,349
WELL, NOW WE GOT A REASON.

375
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,351
WHAT?

376
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,354
WE'RE FASHIONING A VERY LONG POKING DEVICE.

377
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,357
ALL RIGHT.

378
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,362
HEY, UH... WHAT'S THE MATTER?

379
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,867
I TALKED TO JANICE.

380
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,868
OH, MY GOD.

381
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,870
IS SHE GOING BACK TO HIM?

382
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,872
SHE DOESN'T KNOW.

383
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,874
SAYS SHE LOVES US BOTH.

384
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,876
YOU KNOW, I WOKE UP

385
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,378
THIS MORNING, I WAS IN LOVE.

386
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,881
I WAS HAPPY.

387
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,382
YOU KNOW, IT SERVES ME RIGHT

388
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,885
FOR BUYING THAT 12 PACK OF CONDOMS.

389
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,388
AND NOW, I CAN'T EVEN RETURN THEM

390
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,390
BECAUSE SHE CHOKED ON THE RECEIPT.

391
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,394
WHAT ARE YOU, UH...

392
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,396
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

393
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,901
I DON'T KNOW.

394
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,403
YOU KNOW? WHAT, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

395
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,407
UH, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I'D DO.

396
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,909
COME ON.

397
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:10,910
COME ON. TELL ME.

398
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,413
ALL RIGHT.

399
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,414
YOU'RE, UH...

400
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,416
PROBABLY NOT GOING TO WANT TO HEAR THIS

401
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,918
BUT, UH...

402
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,922
IF IT WAS ME--

403
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,423
AND THIS IS JUST ME--

404
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,424
I WOULD, UH...

405
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,425
I WOULD BOW OUT.

406
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,427
WHAT?!

407
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,429
WHAT ARE YOU...

408
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,431
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

409
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,936
THEY HAVE A KID TOGETHER.

410
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,437
YOU KNOW?

411
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,939
THEY'RE LIKE...

412
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,941
THEY'RE LIKE A FAMILY....

413
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,943
AND IF, I DON'T KNOW

414
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,946
IF THERE'S A CHANCE THEY CAN MAKE THAT WORK

415
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,948
I KNOW I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE THE GUY

416
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,950
WHO STOOD IN THE WAY OF THAT.

417
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,956
YOU OKAY?

418
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,457

419
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,959
YOU, UH...

420
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,962
YOU WANT TO COME POKE A NUDE GUY?

421
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,968
WELL, HE'S FINALLY ASLEEP.

422
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:13,472
ABOUT THAT, UH, BUMP ON HIS HEAD...

423
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,474
ARE, UH, ARE YOU SURE IT'S A NEW BUMP?

424
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,475
I MEAN, NO OFFENSE

425
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,477
BUT I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF BEN

426
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,479
AS A FAIRLY BUMPY HEADED CHILD.

427
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,981
IT'S OKAY IF HE BUMPS HIS HEAD.

428
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,482
KIDS BUMP THEIR HEADS ALL THE TIME.

429
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,484
IT WAS YOUR FIRST TIME BABY SITTING.

430
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,486
I'M SURE YOU DID THE BEST YOU COULD.

431
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,487
I DID.

432
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,989
I KNOW. I'M JUST SAYING

433
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,491
YOU HAVE TO WATCH THEM ALL THE TIME.

434
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,492
I DID!

435
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,494
I WATCHED. I WATCHED.

436
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,496
I WATCHED MONICA BANG HIS HEAD

437
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,497
AGAINST THAT THING!

438
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,000
MONICA DID IT?

439
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,003

440
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,504
MONICA?

441
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,006
YEAH?

442
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,008
DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING WEIRD

443
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,009
ABOUT BEN TODAY?

444
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,012
NO. WHY?

445
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,513
WELL, I WAS JUST PLAYING WITH HIM

446
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,016
AND, YOU KNOW, WE WERE DOING THE ALPHABET SONG

447
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,018
WHICH HE USED TO BE REALLY GOOD AT

448
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,520
BUT SUDDENLY HE'S JUST LEAVING OUT "E" AND "F."

449
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,522
IT'S LIKE THEY JUST, UH, I DON'T KNOW

450
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,024
FELL OUT OF HIS HEAD.

451
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,526
REALLY?

452
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,530
OH, AND ALSO, HE'S, HE'S WALKING...

453
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,531
KIND OF FUNNY.

454
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,033
YEAH, I MEAN

455
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,534
IT'S LIKE HIS LEFT LEG

456
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,535
IS MOVING A LOT FASTER

457
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,037
THAN HIS RIGHT LEG.

458
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,038
YEAH, HE'S IN THERE

459
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,040
JUST SORT OF, YOU KNOW...

460
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:27,546
OH, MY GOD, I WRECKED YOUR BABY!

461
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,549

462
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,052
I HOPE IT'S STILL FUNNY WHEN YOU'RE IN HELL.

463
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,554
YOU JERK.

464
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,557
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE THAT KID.

465
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,060
MONKA BANG! MONKA BANG!

466
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,561
OW.

467
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,564
I'LL GET THE HAT.

468
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,571
JANICE, I HAVE SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU

469
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,074
AND I WANT YOU TO LET ME GET THROUGH IT

470
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,575
BECAUSE IT'S...

471
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,078
IT'S, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

472
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,080
OKAY.

473
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,584
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO BACK WITH GARY.

474
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,090
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE GUY THAT BREAKS UP A FAMILY.

475
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,592
YOU KNOW, WHEN MY PARENTS SPLIT UP

476
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,594
IT WAS BECAUSE OF THAT GUY

477
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,596
AND WHENEVER I WOULD SEE HIM

478
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,099
I WOULD ALWAYS THINK, "YOU'RE THE REASON.

479
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,101
YOU ARE WHY THEY'RE NOT TOGETHER."

480
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,103
AND I HATED THAT GUY.

481
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,606
AND IT DIDN'T MATTER HOW NICE HE WAS

482
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,109
OR, YOU KNOW, HOW HAPPY HE MADE MY DAD.

483
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,615
WOW.

484
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,618
YEAH, WELL...

485
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,121
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

486
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,622

487
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,124
YOU'RE RIGHT.

488
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,126
OH, GOD.

489
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:51,630
BUT BEFORE I CAN SAY... GOOD BYE...

490
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,634
THERE'S SOMETHING I REALLY NEED YOU TO KNOW, CHANDLER.

491
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,137
THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT YOU...

492
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,140
IT'S LIKE I FINALLY UNDERSTAND

493
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,643
WHAT LIONEL RICHIE'S BEEN SINGING ABOUT.

494
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,146
YOU KNOW?

495
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,147
I MEAN, WHAT WE HAVE--

496
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,150
IT'S LIKE MOVIE LOVE.

497
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,153
YOU'RE MY SOUL MATE.

498
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,655
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE

499
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,157
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE SPENDING

500
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,159
THE REST OF OUR LIVES TOGETHER.

501
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,163
THEN DON'T LEAVE ME.

502
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,664
WHAT?

503
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,665
FORGET WHAT I SAID.

504
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,666
I WAS BABBLING.

505
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,667
PICK ME.

506
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,669
NO, YOU WERE RIGHT. YOU WERE RIGHT.

507
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,671
I'VE GOT TO GIVE MY MARRIAGE ANOTHER CHANCE.

508
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,173
NO, YOU DON'T.

509
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,174
NO, NO, NO.

510
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,677
I SAY YOU HAVE TO GIVE YOUR DIVORCE ANOTHER CHANCE.

511
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,680
SWEETIE, YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SETTLE

512
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,682
FOR JUST HALF MY HEART.

513
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,684
I'LL SETTLE FOR HALF YOUR HEART.

514
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,686
I'LL SETTLE FOR A QUARTER OF YOUR HEART.

515
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,190
I'LL SETTLE FOR A LITTLE... A TINY... A VENTRICLE.

516
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,194
I'M SORRY.

517
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,700
OH, DON'T GO.

518
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,203
NO, I I GOT TO GO.

519
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,205
NO.

520
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,706
NO.

521
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,707
NO, NO.

522
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,209
HONEY, HONEY...

523
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,710
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING.

524
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,213
I DON'T CARE.

525
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,714
I DON'T CARE!

526
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,716
YEAH, UM... OKAY.

527
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,719
I'M, I'M LEAVING NOW.

528
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,223
YOU CAN'T LEAVE!

529
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,724
I HAVE YOUR SHOE!

530
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,231
GOOD BYE, CHANDLER BING.

531
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,244
RACHEL HAS THOSE IN BURGUNDY.

532
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,250
ALL RIGHT, NOW, REMEMBER: SOMETHING THIS BIG AND LONG

533
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,252
IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO MANEUVER.

534
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,254
FORTUNATELY, I HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE

535
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,255
IN THAT AREA.

536
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,256

537
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,259
WHAT ARE YOU, 12 TODAY?

538
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,261
CAN WE PLEASE FOCUS HERE?

539
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,763
A NAKED MAN'S LIFE HANGS IN THE BALANCE.

540
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,765
I'M TELLING YOU, HE'S DEAD.

541
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,767
WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE HERE

542
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,769
IS A DEAD FAT GUY ON A STICK.

543
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,273
ALL RIGHT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LET'S POKE.

544
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,276
STEADY, STEADY...

545
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,278
OKAY, A LITTLE HIGHER.

546
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,280
CAREFUL OF THE ANGLE.

547
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,781
OKAY, OKAY.

548
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,283
WE'RE APPROACHING THE WINDOW.

549
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,788
THREAD THE NEEDLE.

550
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,290
THREAD THE NEEDLE.

551
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,796
HE'S ALIVE!

552
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,798
HE'S ALIVE!!!

553
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,802
AND YET WE'RE STILL POKING HIM.

554
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,304
OKAY, RETRACT THE DEVICE.

555
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,805
RETRACT THE DEVICE!

556
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,807
HE DOES NOT LOOK HAPPY.

557
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,811
HEY, NOW HE'S SHOWING US HIS POKING DEVICE.

558
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,314
HEY, THAT'S NEVER GOING TO MAKE IT

559
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,316
ALL THE WAY OVER HERE, BUDDY.

560
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,817
HA!

561
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:08,827
?? I'LL HOLD YOU CLOSE IN MY ARMS ??

562
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:14,333
?? I CAN'T RESIST YOUR CHARM ??

563
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,335
?? AND LOVE... ??

564
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,837
?? LOVE... ??

565
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,340
