4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,519
WOW. THIS GIRL'S GOOD.

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,521
OH, YEAH, A SONG WITH RHYMING WORDS--

6
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,523
OOH, I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE.

7
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,525
? SAY YOU'LL STAY BESIDE ME... ?

8
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,027
I LIKE HER.

9
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,529
WHY, BECAUSE SHE CAN SING AND PLAY GUITAR

10
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,531
AND DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME?

11
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,034
WELL, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL I'M LOOKING FOR

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,035
FROM THESE PEOPLE.

13
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,537
LOOK AT YOU, ALL JEALOUS.

14
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,539
YEAH, PHEEBS, COME ON.

15
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,541
YOU TWO HAVE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STYLES.

16
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,543
YOU KNOW, SHE'S MORE...

17
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,545
YOU KNOW, AND...

18
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,547
YOU'RE MORE...

19
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,550
? SAY YOU'LL STAY ?

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,055
? BESIDE ME. ?

21
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,556
YEAH!

22
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,560
SEE? SEE? EVERYBODY ELSE IS HAPPY SHE'S DONE.

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,063
OKAY, MY NEXT SONG IS CALLED

24
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,066
"PHOEBE BUFFAY, WHAT CAN I SAY?

25
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,067
"I REALLY LOVED

26
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,569
"WHEN WE WERE SINGING PARTNERS

27
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,071
"AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT YOU

28
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,073
THAT WAY."

29
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,574
OH, NO.

30
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:18,078
ONE OF THOSE "LOOK FOR THE HIDDEN MEANING" SONGS.

31
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:24,584

32
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:29,589
?  ?

33
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,092
?  ?

34
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,594
?  ?

35
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:38,098
?  ?

36
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,101
?  ?

37
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,104
?  ?

38
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:48,108
?  ?

39
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,610
?  ?

40
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,113
?  ?

41
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,115
?  ?

42
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,118
?  ?

43
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:04,124
?  ?

44
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,628
HEY, PHOEBE.

45
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,630
HEY, LESLIE.

46
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,632
HOW DID YOU KNOW I'D BE HERE?

47
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,635
I RAN INTO VLAD AT THE PLACE WHERE THEY SELL THE BIG FISH.

48
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,637
HE SAID YOU PLAYED HERE A LOT, SO, UM...

49
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,639
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM

50
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,642
BUT IF "THE PLACE WITH THE BIG FISH" COMES UP AGAIN

51
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,645
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER THAT'S SEVERAL BIG FISH

52
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,646
OR JUST ONE BIG FISH.

53
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,149
SO PHOEBE TELLS US YOU WRITE JINGLES.

54
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,151
ACTUALLY, I SAID SHE ABANDONED ME

55
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,152
TO WRITE JINGLES.

56
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,154
 UH, ANYTHING

57
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,655
WE MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF?

58
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,157
UH, YEAH, UM...

59
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,159
? HOME IS NEVER FAR AWAY ?

60
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:44,664
All except  ? HOME IS HOMESTAR STEW. ?

61
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,167
YEAH, BUT I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE.

62
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,169
I GOT KIND OF SICK OF IT

63
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,172
AND THEN I COULDN'T COME UP WITH ANYTHING GOOD

64
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,673
SO THEY FIRED ME.

65
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,675
BUMMER.

66
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,678
WELL, UH, YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST...

67
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,680
UM, I WAS JUST THINKING

68
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,682
AND JUST HOPING THAT...

69
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,186
MAYBE YOU'D WANT TO GET BACK TOGETHER.

70
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,188
NO, BUT THANKS.

71
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,690
COME ON, PHOEBE, WOULD YOU JUST THINK ABOUT IT?

72
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,692
OKAY.

73
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,695
NO, BUT THANKS.

74
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,199
OKAY.

75
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,700
UH...

76
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,202
SEE YOU, PHEEBS.

77
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,707
WOW. THAT WAS KIND OF BRUTAL.

78
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,710
WELL, OKAY, LET THIS BE A LESSON TO ALL OF YOU.

79
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,712
ONCE YOU... ONCE YOU BETRAY ME

80
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,214
I BECOME LIKE THE ICEWOMAN.

81
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,717
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST... VERY COLD, HARD...

82
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,718
UNYIELDING.

83
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,220
YOU KNOW, NOTHING...

84
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,722
NOTHING CAN PENETRATE THIS ICY EXTERIOR.

85
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,724
CAN I HAVE A TISSUE, PLEASE?

86
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,233
SOMEONE IN THERE?

87
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,734
NO, THIS IS JUST PART

88
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,736
OF A DAREDEVIL GAME THAT I PLAY

89
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,738
CALL "WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT

90
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,240
BEFORE I BURST AND DIE."

91
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,242
GEEZ, MAN, DID YOU FALL...?

92
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,743
HI.

93
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,745
SO, UH, DID YOU?

94
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,747
DID YOU FALL HI?

95
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,250
SOMEONE WAS IN THE LADIES' ROOM; I COULDN'T WAIT.

96
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,252
I LEFT THE LID UP FOR YOU, THOUGH.

97
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,254

98
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,256
YOU KNOW WHAT, GUNTHER?

99
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,757
GO, UH, GO AHEAD.

100
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,259
I'M TALKING TO, UH...

101
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,762
THIS IS THE PART WHERE YOU SAY YOUR NAME.

102
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,764
GINGER.

103
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,765
GINGER.

104
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,267
I'M TALKING TO GINGER. SO...

105
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,772
DON'T YOU HAVE TO USE THE BATHROOM?

106
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,773
NO. NO.

107
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,275

00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,784
SOMEONE IN HERE.

112
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,787
WHERE'S CHANDLER?

113
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,788
HE CAN'T MAKE IT.

114
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,790
HE SAID HE HAD TO GO BACK TO HIS JOB

115
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,791
AND DO, UH...

116
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,294

00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,798
JOEY TRIBBIANI.

119
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,806
JOEY, I CAN SEE YOU, OKAY?

120
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,309
YOU'RE HIDING BEHIND THE COATS.

121
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,819

133
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,345
WHAT IS IT THIS TIME?

134
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,846
ACTUALLY, IT'S KIND OF MY FAULT.

135
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:47,847
I QUIT TODAY.

136
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,848

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,361
OH, WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,863
SO I GUESS THIS IS GOOD BYE THEN.

145
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,365

00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,368
OKAY THEN.

00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,907
IT'S, LIKE, THE 20th TIME TODAY.

159
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,409
GOOD LUCK, LESLIE.

YOU KNOW, WE WERE BEST FRIENDS.

163
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,417
EVER SINCE WE WERE LITTLE

164
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,419
OUR MOMS WORKED ON THE BARGE TOGETHER.

165
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,420
OH.

166
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,422
YOU TWO MUST HAVE BEEN SO CUTE

167
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,424
RUNNING AROUND ON A BARGE.

168
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,426
YOU NEVER RUN ON A BARGE.

169
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,429
HEY.

170
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,430
HEY. HEY.

171
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,931

172
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,434
NO. HE MET SOME GIRL AT THE COFFEEHOUSE.

173
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,435
OOH.

174
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,936
YEAH. GINGER SOMETHING.

175
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,438
NO.

176
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,939
NO, NO.

177
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,943
ARE YOU SURE IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT SOUNDED LIKE GINGER?

178
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,445
LIKE, UH, GINGEER?

179
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,448
NO, IT WAS GINGER.

180
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,451
I REMEMBER BECAUSE WHEN HE TOLD ME, I SAID...

181
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,453
? THE MOVIE STAR... ?

182
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,454
AW, MAN.

183
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,456
THAT'S THE GIRL I WAS HIDING FROM.

184
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,458
WHEN SHE FINDS OUT HE'S MY ROOMMATE

185
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,460
SHE'S GOING TO TELL HIM WHAT I DID.

186
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,461
WHAT DID YOU DO?

187
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,962
OH, OH, NO, NO, I CAN'T...

188
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,464
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT.

189
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,966
IT'S, LIKE, THE MOST AWFUL, HORRIBLE THING

190
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,968
I'VE EVER DONE IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

191
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,470
WOW! YOU'RE REALLY NOT MAKING US

192
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,472
WANT TO HEAR IT LESS.

193
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,473
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

194
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,974
DON'T TELL US.

195
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,476
WE'LL JUST WAIT TILL CHANDLER GETS HOME

196
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,977
BECAUSE IT'LL BE MORE FUN THAT WAY.

197
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:58,978
ALL RIGHT.

198
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,481
OKAY, IT WAS, LIKE, FOUR YEARS AGO.

199
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,484
OKAY, GINGER AND I HAD GONE OUT A FEW TIMES.

200
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,985
AND THEN, THIS ONE WEEKEND

201
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,987
WE WENT UP TO HER DAD'S CABIN--

202
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,990
JUST ME, HER, AND HER ANNOYING LITTLE DOG, PEPPER.

203
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,492

204
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,495
WELL, THAT NIGHT, I COOKED THIS REALLY ROMANTIC DINNER...

205
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,997
YOU GAVE HER FOOD POISONING!

206
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,499
I WISH.

207
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,502
AFTER DINNER, ME, HER, AND PEPPER ALL FELL ASLEEP

208
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,003
IN FRONT OF THE FIRE.

209
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,006
WELL, I WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

210
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,509
AND I SAW THAT THE FIRE WAS DYING OUT

211
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,511
SO I PICKED UP A LOG AND THREW IT ON.

212
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,515
OR AT LEAST WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A LOG.

213
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,017
OH, MY GOD, YOU THREW PEPPER ON THE FIRE!

214
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,520
I WISH.

215
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,023
SEE, I GUESS ANOTHER THING

216
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,026
I PROBABLY SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU ABOUT GINGER

217
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,028
IS THAT SHE KIND OF HAS A, UH...

218
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,530
ARTIFICIAL LEG.

219
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,037
OH, MY GOD!

220
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,041
YOU THREW IT ON THE FIRE?

221
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,544
WHAT... SHE MUST HAVE FREAKED OUT!

222
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,547
YEAH, SHE MUST HAVE.

223
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,049
YOU DON'T KNOW?

224
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,051
WELL, I...

225
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,553
JOEY, WHAT DID YOU DO

226
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,054
AFTER YOU THREW HER LEG ON THE FIRE?

227
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,557
I RAN!

228
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,059
YOU RAN?

229
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,562
YEAH. THROUGH THE WOODS, WITH NO SOCKS ON.

230
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,574
WELL, THAT'S THE BEST KISS I'VE HAD

231
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,076
WITH ANYBODY I MET IN THE MEN'S ROOM.

232
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,579
ACTUALLY, ME, TOO.

233
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,581
OH. FOOT IN THE PUDDLE.

234
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,583
FOOT ALL IN THE PUDDLE.

235
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,084
OH, DAMN. I HATE THAT.

236
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,086
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET YOU OUT

237
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,087
OF THOSE SHOES.

238
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,589
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

239
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,591
NO, REALLY, YOU'RE GOING TO FREEZE.

240
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,092
NO, I'M NOT. I'M...

241
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,093
YOU'RE NOT?

242
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,595
WHAT DO YOU...?

243
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,097
WHAT DO YOU GOT, A BIONIC FOOT?

244
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,601
SOMEDAY MAYBE.

245
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,611

246
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,112
FUNNY BOOK?

247
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,113
HMM?

248
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,615
OH, NO, NO.

249
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,118
I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING FUNNY I HEARD TODAY--

250
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:23,122
UM, MARK... MARK SAYING, "I'LL SEE YOU SATURDAY."

251
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,125
YEAH, AT THE LECTURE.

252
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,627
I TOLD YOU THAT LAST WEEK.

253
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,629
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T MIND.

254
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,131
OH, NO, NO, IT'S NOT THE LECTURE I MIND.

255
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,132
UM...

256
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,135
PLEASE TELL ME IT'S NOT BECAUSE I'M GOING WITH MARK.

257
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,137
WELL...

258
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,639
OH, MY GOD! ROSS!

259
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,140
WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT...

260
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,643
LOOK, IF YOU'RE NOT WORKING WITH HIM ANYMORE

261
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,145
WHY DO YOU STILL HAVE TO DO STUFF WITH HIM?

262
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,647
BECAUSE HE'S MY FRIEND.

263
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:52,151
OKAY, BUT DO YOU REALLY NEED ANOTHER FRIEND?

264
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,653
OKAY, WELL

265
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,155
IF I STOP PLAYING WITH JOEY AND CHANDLER

266
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,657
CAN I PLAY WITH MARK?

267
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,158
IS THAT FUNNY?

268
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,160
AM I SUPPOSED TO BE LAUGHING?

269
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,161
I DON'T KNOW.

270
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,663
YOU THOUGHT

271
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,164
"SEE YOU SATURDAY" WAS FUNNY.

272
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,666
LOOK, HONEY, MARK IS IN FASHION, OKAY?

273
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,667
I LIKE HAVING A FRIEND

274
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,669
THAT I CAN SHARE THIS STUFF WITH.

275
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,670
YOU GUYS WOULD NEVER WANT

276
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,171
TO GO TO A LECTURE WITH ME.

277
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,173
PAAH!

278
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,675
I WOULD LOVE

279
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,176
TO GO WITH YOU.

280
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,678
REALLY?

281
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,180
YEAH. HEY, I HAVE CLOTHES.

282
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,682
I EVEN PICK THEM OUT.

283
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,185
I MEAN, FOR ALL YOU KNOW, I COULD BE A FASHION...

284
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,687
MONGER.

285
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,693
OKAY, HONEY, I WOULD LOVE

286
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,194
FOR YOU TO GO WITH ME.

287
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,196
WHAT?

288
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,698
WHAT SHOULD I WEAR?

289
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,700
NOW I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.

290
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:54,213
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY A WATCHED POT NEVER BEEPS.

291
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:59,218
IT'S... YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN A COUPLE OF HOURS, AND...

292
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,220
SHE HASN'T CALLED.

293
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,722
NOT THAT I EVEN CARE.

294
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,223
I DON'T.

295
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,226
PHOEBE, WHY DON'T YOU JUST CALL HER?

296
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,228
YOU OBVIOUSLY WANT TO.

297
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,731
YOU THINK YOU KNOW ME SO WELL.

298
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,232
WELL, DON'T YOU WANT TO?

299
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,734
YEAH.

300
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,737
OKAY, SO I DO KNOW YOU.

301
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,238
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

302
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,742
WELL, SO?

303
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,243
I CAN'T.

304
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,745
I CAN'T.

305
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,746
SHE DUMPED ME.

306
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,247
I TOTALLY TRUSTED HER

307
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,751
AND THEN ONE DAY, IT WAS, LIKE, "BYE, PHEEBS." GONE.

308
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,753
YOU KNOW WHAT THE SADDEST PART IS?

309
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,255
WHEN WE WERE PLAYING TOGETHER

310
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,759
THAT WAS, LIKE, THE MOST FUN I'VE EVER HAD

311
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,761
IN, LIKE, ALL MY LIVES.

312
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,265
? MY FAVORITE SHOES, SO GOOD TO ME ?

313
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,768

00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,771

00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,773

316
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,776
? MY FEET'S BEST FRIEND, PALS TO THE END ?

317
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,779
? WITH THEM I'M ONE HOT CHICKY ?

318
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,781
? THOUGH LATE ONE NIGHT ?

319
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,282
? NOT MUCH LIGHT ?

320
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:07,286
? I STEPPED IN SOMETHING ICKY ?

321
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,290

322
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,792
? STICKY SHOES ?

323
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,294

324
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,796
? STICKY SHOES ?

325
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,798
? STICKY SHOES ?

326
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,801
? NEXT TIME I'LL ?

327
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,804
? AVOID THE ?

328
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,807
? PILE. ?

329
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,308

330
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,313
 WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE

331
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,316
A LOT OF LAYERING OF SHEER FABRICS AND COLORS.

332
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,318
FOR INSTANCE, A SHEER NAVY BLOUSE

333
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,820
OVER A PINK BODYSUIT...

334
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,322
I'M REALLY GLAD WE CAME.

335
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,825

...AND THE DESIGNERS ARE USING HEAVIER JERSEYS

339
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,332
OR PROVIDING SLIPS...

340
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,333
I LOVE YOU.

00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,334
OH.

YOU KNOW, YOU COULD TOTALLY SELL THIS!

350
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,859
IT WOULD BE PERFECT FOR, LIKE, UM....

351
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,360
A KITTY LITTER CAMPAIGN.

352
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,862
A JINGLE? NO.

353
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,363
NO, NO, NO. NO.

354
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,365
WHY NOT? YOU'D MAKE A TON OF MONEY.

355
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,867
WELL, IF I WAS IN THIS FOR THE MONEY

356
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,869
I WOULD BE A MILLIONAIRE BY NOW, YOU KNOW?

357

YOU JUST GOT TO GET OUT

358
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,875
OF THAT JINGLE HEAD, SWEETIE.

359
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,877
AH! YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT! I'M SORRY.

360
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,378
THAT'S OKAY.

361
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,881
ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING TO PLAY A SONG NOW

362
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,883
THAT'S REALLY, REALLY SAD, OKAY?

363
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,884
IT'S CALLED

 ...OVERSIZED BRACELETS, OVERSIZED EARRINGS

366
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,395
OVERSIZING OF ACCESSORIES IN GENERAL

367
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,897
IS VERY POPULAR NOW.

368
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,899

369
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,901

370
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,403

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,912
MY MILK'S GONE BAD.

376
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,913
OH. I HATE THAT.

377
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,415
I ONCE HAD A THING OF HALF AND HALF--

378
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,416
IT STOLE MY CAR.

379
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,421
SO, UM... HOW WAS YOUR DATE WITH GINGER?

380
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,423

SHE'S GREATNESS.

384
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,430
HMM.

385
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,433
SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S GOT THE, UH...

386
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,435
WHOLE PACKAGE.

387
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,938
OH, YEAH.

388
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,940
SO SHE'S GOT IT ALL, HUH?

389
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,443
SHE'S THE REAL DEAL.

390
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,946
JOEY TOLD YOU ABOUT THE LEG, HUH?

391
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,948
UH HUH.

392
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,449
OH, GOD.

393
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,450
IT FREAKED ME OUT, OKAY?

394
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,952
I KNOW IT SHOULDN'T HAVE, BUT IT DID.

395
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:53,953
I MEAN, I LIKE HER.

396
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,454
I DON'T WANT TO STOP SEEING HER

397
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,956
BUT, EVERY SO OFTEN, IT'S, LIKE

398
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,958
"HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? WHERE'S YOUR LEG?"

399
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,462
I MEAN, I'M THE SMALLEST PERSON

400
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,964
IN THE WORLD, AREN'T I?

401
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,466
I'M THE SMALLEST PERSON IN THE WORLD.

402
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,467
 MORNING.

403
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,469
ACTUALLY,HE'S THE SMALLEST PERSON

404
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,470
IN THE WORLD.

405
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,979
HEARD ABOUT THE LEG BURNING, HUH?

406
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,482
IT CAME UP.

407
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:27,486
LISTEN, I, UH... I KNOW IT'S A LONG SHOT BUT...

408
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,489
BY ANY CHANCE, DID SHE FIND THAT FUNNY?

409
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,997
SO I NODDED OFF A LITTLE.

410
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:38,998
NODDED OFF?!

411
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,000
ROSS, YOU WERE SNORING!

412
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,501
MY FATHER'S BOAT

413
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,004
DIDN'T MAKE THAT MUCH NOISE WHEN IT HIT ROCKS!

414
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,005
COME ON.

415
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,007
45 MINUTES!

416
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:52,511
45 MINUTES THE MAN TALKED ABOUT STRAPPY BACKED DRESSES.

417
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,514
WELL, OKAY, HOW ABOUT FOUR HOURS

418
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,017
IN A FREEZING MUSEUM AUDITORIUM

419
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,019
LISTENING TO PROFESSOR PIT STAINS

420
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,021
AND HIS, "HEY, EVERYBODY!

421
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,024
"REMEMBER THAT THING THAT'S BEEN DEAD FOR A GAZILLION YEARS?

422
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,027
WELL, HERE'S A LITTLE BONE WE DIDN'T KNOW IT HAD!"

423
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,534
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S PROFESSORPITAIN.

424
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,537
AND, SECOND OF ALL, THAT LITTLE BONE PROVED

425
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:22,041
THAT THAT PARTICULAR DINOSAUR HAD WINGS BUT DIDN'T FLY.

426
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,043
OKAY, SEE, NOW, WHAT I JUST HEARD:

427
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,046
BLAH BLAH BLAH, BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH

428
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,547
BLAH BLAH, BLAH BLAH.

429
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,049
YOU KNOW WHAT?

430
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,551
A HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE WENT TO SEE A MOVIE

431
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,552
ABOUT WHAT I DO.

432
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,554
I WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE

433
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,057
WOULD GO SEE A MOVIE CALLED JURASSIC PARKA.

434
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,058
OH...

435
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,559
THAT IS SO...!

436
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,561
NO, NO, NO-- A BUNCH OF OUT OF CONTROL JACKETS

437
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,063
TAKE OVER AN ISLAND!

438
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,065

439
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,073
YOU KNOW, IF WHAT I DO IS SO LAME

440
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,576
THEN WHY DID YOU INSIST ON COMING WITH ME THIS MORNING?

441
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,579
HUH? WAS IT SO I JUST WOULDN'T GO WITH MARK?

442
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,580
NO.

443
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,583
I... I WANTED TO BE WITH YOU.

444
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,085
I DON'T KNOW.

445
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,586
I FEEL LIKE... LATELY...

446
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,589
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE SLIPPING AWAY FROM ME

447
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,091
YOU KNOW, WITH THIS NEW JOB

448
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,592
AND ALL THESE NEW PEOPLE

449
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,095
AND YOU'VE  GOT THIS WHOLE LIFE GOING ON.

450
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,596
I KNOW IT'S DUMB

451
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,099
BUT I... I JUST HATE

452
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,601
THAT I'M NOT A PART OF IT.

453
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,608
IT'S NOT DUMB.

454
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,611
BUT MAYBE IT'S OKAY THAT YOU'RE NOT A PART OF IT.

455
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,613
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

456
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,616
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE

457
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,119
I LIKE THAT YOU'RE NOT INVOLVED

458
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,621
IN THAT PART OF MY LIFE.

459
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,623
THAT'S A LITTLE CLEARER.

460
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,125
NO, BUT HONEY, SEE

461
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,627
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU

462
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,628
BECAUSE I DO.

463
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,629
I LOVE YOU.

464
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,630
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH

465
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,133
BUT MY WORK, IT'S FOR ME, YOU KNOW?

466
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,136
I'M OUT THERE ON MY OWN AND I'M DOING IT

467
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,637
AND IT'S SCARY

468
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,640
BUT I LOVE IT BECAUSE IT'S MINE.

469
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,643
BUT, I MEAN, IS THAT OKAY?

470
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,145
SURE, UH...

471
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,648

472
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,157
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT MY LEG, AREN'T YOU?

473
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,158
NO.

474
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,659
NO. ACTUALLY, I FORGET.

475
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,162
WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH THAT AGAIN?

476
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,164
LOOK, IT'S OKAY IF IT BOTHERS YOU.

477
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,666
REALLY. I MEAN, THE ONLY THING I NEED TO KNOW

478
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,168
I SHOW MUCH IT BOTHERS YOU

479
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,670
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE WASTING MY TIME.

480
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,173
AM I WASTING MY TIME?

481
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,174
NO.

482
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,176
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

483
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,177
OKAY.

484
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,679
I MEAN, IT'S JUST LIKE ANYTHING ELSE:

485
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,681
YOU JUST HAVE TO GET USED TO IT.

486
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,683
MMM.

487
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,684
MMM.

488
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,194
WHAT'S THAT?

489
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,697
THAT'S... THAT'S MY NUBBIN.

490
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,204
WHAT'S A NUBBIN?

491
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,205

492
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,706
IT'S KIND OF A, UH...

493
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,709
A THIRD NIPPLE KIND OF THING.

494
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,212
DO YOU HAVE THREE NIPPLES?

495
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,714
WELL, YOU KNOW, TWO REGULARS

496
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,718
AND ONE THAT BARELY QUALIFIES AS A...

497
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,221

498
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,222
UH, WHAT?

499
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,223
NOTHING.

500
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,226
I... I JUST REMEMBERED I HAVE TO LEAVE.

501
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,227
YOU, UH...

502
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,728
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE NOW?

503
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,230
HOW COME?

504
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,232
UH, WELL, IT'S NUBBIN... NOTHING!

505
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,733
UM...

506
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,734
YOU KNOW WHAT?

507
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,237
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, OKAY?

508
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,242
EEW!

509
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,747
OH, I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T COMING.

510
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,748
WHERE WERE YOU?

511
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,250
COME HERE, COME HERE.

512
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,251
OKAY.

513
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,253
DON'T GET MAD, OKAY?

514
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,256
DON'T GIVE ME A REASON TO GET MAD, OKAY?

515
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,757
I PLAYED "SMELLY CAT"

516
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,759
FOR THE PEOPLE AT MY OLD AD AGENCY.

517
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,760
THEY WENT NUTS.

518
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,761
NO... LOOK, I TOLD YOU

519
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,764
THAT I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO TRY AND SELL IT

520
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,765
AND YOU JUST...

521
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,767
YOU BIG, FAT DID IT ANYWAY.

522
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,768
UH...

523
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,270
GOD, YOU KNOW WHAT?

524
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,771
I THINK, FIVE YEARS AGO

525
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,274
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO PLAY WITH YOU

526
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,775
BUT I CAN DO IT BY MYSELF

527
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,778
AND IF I CAN'T TRUST YOU, THEN JUST FORGET IT.

528
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,780
NO, NO. I DON'T WANT TO FORGET IT.

529
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,781
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

530
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,283
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE.

531
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,786
IF THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ON THE PLANET TO YOU

532
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,288
IS THIS CAT POOPY THING

533
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,790
THEN, OKAY, YOU CAN HAVE "SMELLY CAT"

534
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,792
BUT WE WON'T BE PARTNERS.

535
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,793
OH.

536
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,295
SO WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE?

537
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,796
? Smelly cat, smelly cat ?

538
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,798
Problem odor in the litter box?

539
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,300
Don't change your kitty.

540
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,302
Change your kitty litter.

541
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,805

542
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,808

AND, YOU KNOW, YOU LEARN YOUR LITTLE LESSONS

548
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,322
AND, HOPEFULLY, YOU GROW.

549
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,323
YEAH.

550
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,824

00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,327
