2889
01:56:25,715 --> 01:56:27,717
SO, YOUR FIRST SEXUAL EXPERIENCE

2890
01:56:27,717 --> 01:56:28,718
WAS WITH A WOMAN?

2891
01:56:28,718 --> 01:56:30,219
ALL RIGHT, I WAS 15.

2892
01:56:30,219 --> 01:56:32,221
IT WAS MY BEST FRIEND RUTH

2893
01:56:32,221 --> 01:56:34,223
AND WE GOT DRUNK ON THAT HARD CIDER

2894
01:56:34,223 --> 01:56:36,225
AND THEN SUDDENLY, I DON'T KNOW--

2895
01:56:36,225 --> 01:56:37,727
WE WERE... WE WERE MAKING OUT.

2896
01:56:37,727 --> 01:56:39,729
TELL IT AGAIN.

2897
01:56:43,232 --> 01:56:44,233
SERIOUSLY.

2898
01:56:45,735 --> 01:56:47,236
IS THAT WOMAN

2899
01:56:47,236 --> 01:56:48,237
CAPABLE OF TALKING

2900
01:56:48,237 --> 01:56:49,739
ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE BUT SEX?

2901
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:52,241
YEAH, SURE.

2902
01:56:52,241 --> 01:56:53,242
WELL, YOU KNOW, EARLIER

2903
01:56:53,743 --> 01:56:55,745
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT GEOGRAPHY.

2904
01:56:55,745 --> 01:57:00,249
JOEY, SHE WAS LISTING THE COUNTRIES SHE'S DONE IT IN.

2905
01:57:00,249 --> 01:57:03,252
WELL, I THINK WE ALL LEARNED SOMETHING.

2906
01:57:04,754 --> 01:57:06,255
HEY, YOU GUYS, LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

2907
01:57:06,255 --> 01:57:08,758
LOOK AT THIS-- THAT'S MY MOM'S WRITING.

2908
01:57:08,758 --> 01:57:09,759
LOOK.

2909
01:57:09,759 --> 01:57:13,763
"ME AND FRANK AND PHOEBE, GRADUATION, 1965."

2910
01:57:13,763 --> 01:57:15,264
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

2911
01:57:15,264 --> 01:57:16,766
THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY 50?

2912
01:57:16,766 --> 01:57:18,267
NO, NO. THAT'S NOT MEPHOEBE.

2913
01:57:18,267 --> 01:57:19,769
THAT'S HER PAL PHOEBE.

2914
01:57:19,769 --> 01:57:21,771
ACCORDING TO HER HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK

2915
01:57:21,771 --> 01:57:23,272
THEY WERE, LIKE, B.F.F.

2916
01:57:24,273 --> 01:57:26,275
"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER."

2917
01:57:26,275 --> 01:57:27,276
OH. OH.

2918
01:57:27,276 --> 01:57:28,778
THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S SO COOL.

2919
01:57:28,778 --> 01:57:29,779
I KNOW. SO THIS WOMAN

2920
01:57:30,279 --> 01:57:32,782
PROBABLY HAS ALL KINDS OF STORIES ABOUT MY PARENTS.

2921
01:57:32,782 --> 01:57:34,784
SHE MIGHT EVEN KNOW, LIKE, WHERE MY DAD IS.

2922
01:57:34,784 --> 01:57:36,285
SO I LOOKED HER UP

2923
01:57:36,285 --> 01:57:37,286
AND SHE LIVES OUT BY THE BEACH.

2924
01:57:37,286 --> 01:57:39,288
SO, MAYBE THIS WEEKEND WE COULD GO TO THE BEACH.

2925
01:57:39,288 --> 01:57:40,790
WE CAN, YEAH.

2926
01:57:40,790 --> 01:57:42,792
SHOOT, I CAN'T GO-- I HAVE TO WORK.

2927
01:57:42,792 --> 01:57:43,793
THAT'S TOO BAD.

2928
01:57:43,793 --> 01:57:46,295
AWW, BIG FAT BUMMER.

2929
01:57:46,295 --> 01:57:47,797
SO, GREAT. OKAY.

2930
01:57:47,797 --> 01:57:50,299
TOMORROW WE'LL DRIVE OUT TO MONTAUK.

2931
01:57:50,299 --> 01:57:52,301
HEY, BONNIE HAD SEX THERE.

2932
01:57:54,303 --> 01:57:59,308

2933
01:57:59,308 --> 01:58:04,814
?  ?

2934
01:58:04,814 --> 01:58:06,816
?  ?

2935
01:58:06,816 --> 01:58:09,819
?  ?

2936
01:58:09,819 --> 01:58:14,323
?  ?

2937
01:58:14,824 --> 01:58:15,825
?  ?

2938
01:58:16,325 --> 01:58:19,328
?  ?

2939
01:58:19,328 --> 01:58:23,332
?  ?

2940
01:58:23,332 --> 01:58:25,334
?  ?

2941
01:58:25,334 --> 01:58:28,337
?  ?

2942
01:58:28,337 --> 01:58:30,339
?  ?

2943
01:58:30,339 --> 01:58:32,842
?  ?

2944
01:58:32,842 --> 01:58:39,348
?  ?

2945
01:58:42,351 --> 01:58:43,853
HEY. JOEY WILL BE RIGHT DOWN.

2946
01:58:43,853 --> 01:58:45,354
HE'S JUST LOOKING FOR HIS MASK.

2947
01:58:45,354 --> 01:58:46,355
HIS SWIM MASK?

2948
01:58:46,355 --> 01:58:47,356
NO. HIS GORILLA MASK.

2949
01:58:47,356 --> 01:58:49,358
HE, UH... WEARS IT

2950
01:58:49,358 --> 01:58:51,861
IN THE OCEAN TO SCARE OFF THE FISH.

2951
01:58:53,362 --> 01:58:56,365
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?

2952
01:58:56,365 --> 01:58:59,368
I'M NEVER GOING TO FIND A BOYFRIEND AGAIN.

2953
01:58:59,368 --> 01:59:01,871
I'LL DIE AN OLD MAID.

2954
01:59:01,871 --> 01:59:04,373
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DIE AN OLD MAID.

2955
01:59:04,373 --> 01:59:07,376
MAYBE AN OLD... SPINSTER COOK.

2956
01:59:09,378 --> 01:59:10,880
THANKS.

2957
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:12,381
BESIDES, WORSE COMES TO WORST

2958
01:59:12,381 --> 01:59:13,883
I'LL BE YOUR BOYFRIEND.

2959
01:59:15,384 --> 01:59:17,386

2960
01:59:17,386 --> 01:59:19,388
YEAH, RIGHT.

2961
01:59:19,388 --> 01:59:22,391

2962
01:59:22,391 --> 01:59:24,894
WHY IS THAT SO FUNNY?

2963
01:59:24,894 --> 01:59:26,395
YOU MADE A JOKE, RIGHT?

2964
01:59:26,395 --> 01:59:27,897
SO I LAUGHED.

2965
01:59:27,897 --> 01:59:29,398

2966
01:59:29,398 --> 01:59:30,900

2967
01:59:30,900 --> 01:59:32,902
A LITTLE TOO HARD.

2968
01:59:32,902 --> 01:59:35,905
WHAT AM I, NOT, UH, BOYFRIEND MATERIAL?

2969
01:59:35,905 --> 01:59:38,908
NO. YOU'RE CHANDLER.

2970
01:59:40,910 --> 01:59:43,412
YOU KNOW... CHANDLER.

2971
01:59:43,412 --> 01:59:46,415
OKAY, SO WE'VE ESTABLISHED MY NAME AND HIT ME.

2972
01:59:46,415 --> 01:59:48,918
BUT, THEORETICALLY, YOU KNOW, SAY WE WEREN'T FRIENDS.

2973
01:59:48,918 --> 01:59:51,921
SAY IT'S A BLIND DATE, I SHOW UP AT YOUR DOOR

2974
01:59:51,921 --> 01:59:53,422
AND I'M, LIKE, UH

2975
01:59:53,422 --> 01:59:56,425
"HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU. HEY..."

2976
01:59:56,425 --> 01:59:59,428
I'D PROBABLY BE SCARED OF THE GUY

2977
01:59:59,428 --> 02:00:00,930
USING A FAKE VOICE.

2978
02:00:00,930 --> 02:00:01,931
HEY.

2979
02:00:01,931 --> 02:00:03,933
HEY. OH, GOOD. YOU BOUGHT FOOD.

2980
02:00:03,933 --> 02:00:05,935
NO. JUST MY LUGGAGE.

2981
02:00:05,935 --> 02:00:07,436

2982
02:00:07,436 --> 02:00:08,938
HEY. HI.

2983
02:00:08,938 --> 02:00:10,439
HEY, GUYS.

2984
02:00:10,439 --> 02:00:11,440
WHOO!

2985
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:12,441
ALL RIGHT. YES.

2986
02:00:12,441 --> 02:00:14,443
I AM HAVING THE BEST KARMA THIS WEEK.

2987
02:00:14,443 --> 02:00:16,946
FIRST, I FIND THIS WOMAN WHO KNEW MY PARENTS

2988
02:00:16,946 --> 02:00:19,949
AND THEN MY CLIENT WITH THE FUZZY BACK

2989
02:00:19,949 --> 02:00:21,450
GIVES ME HIS BEACH HOUSE.

2990
02:00:21,450 --> 02:00:24,453
UH HUH. WHAT ABOUT THAT BIKE MESSENGER YOU HIT?

2991
02:00:24,453 --> 02:00:26,956
OH, I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT HIS KARMA.

2992
02:00:26,956 --> 02:00:27,957
HEY.

2993
02:00:27,957 --> 02:00:28,958
HEY.

2994
02:00:28,958 --> 02:00:31,460
HEY, CHECK OUT THE HAT.

2995
02:00:32,962 --> 02:00:34,463
WAIT A MINUTE.

2996
02:00:34,463 --> 02:00:35,965
I KNOW THAT HAT.

2997
02:00:35,965 --> 02:00:38,467
I WAS TAKEN ABOARD THAT HAT.

2998
02:00:39,969 --> 02:00:41,971
THEY DID EXPERIMENTS ON ME.

2999
02:00:41,971 --> 02:00:43,472
I CAN'T HAVE CHILDREN!

3000
02:00:43,472 --> 02:00:46,976
SERIOUSLY, WHERE DID YOU GET THE HAT?

3001
02:00:46,976 --> 02:00:48,477
ROSS GAVE IT TO ME.

3002
02:00:48,477 --> 02:00:50,479
I THINK SHE LOOKS GOOD.

3003
02:00:50,479 --> 02:00:51,480
OH, THANK YOU.

3004
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:53,482
HE BUY IT FOR YOU OR...

3005
02:00:53,482 --> 02:00:55,484
OR WIN IT FOR YOU?

3006
02:00:55,484 --> 02:00:58,487
WELL, EXCUSE ME, MY FASHION IMPAIRED FRIENDS.

3007
02:00:58,487 --> 02:01:01,490
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT HATS ARE BACK.

3008
02:01:01,490 --> 02:01:03,492
AND THIS TIME THEY'VE GANGED UP

3009
02:01:03,492 --> 02:01:05,494
AND FORMED ONE GIANT SUPER HAT.

3010
02:01:11,500 --> 02:01:13,002
GO, GO, GO!

3011
02:01:13,002 --> 02:01:15,004
NOW EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE UNDER THE HAT.

3012
02:01:18,507 --> 02:01:20,009
WHOA.

3013
02:01:20,009 --> 02:01:21,510
OY.

3014
02:01:22,511 --> 02:01:24,013
WHAT'S WITH ALL THIS SAND?

3015
02:01:24,013 --> 02:01:27,516
OH, YEAH, BOB SAID THERE MIGHT BE FLOOD DAMAGE.

3016
02:01:27,516 --> 02:01:30,019
EITHER THAT OR HE HAS A REALLY BIG CAT.

3017
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:33,522
 YOU KNOW WHAT THIS REMINDS ME OF?

3018
02:01:33,522 --> 02:01:37,526
WHY COULDN'T I BE YOUR BOYFRIEND?

3019
02:01:37,526 --> 02:01:39,028
ARE YOU STILL ON THAT?

3020
02:01:39,028 --> 02:01:40,029
UH HUH.

3021
02:01:40,029 --> 02:01:41,530
WOULD YOU LET IT GO ALREADY?

3022
02:01:41,530 --> 02:01:43,032
THANK YOU, JOEY.

3023
02:01:43,032 --> 02:01:45,034
BUT YOU'D GO OUT WITH ME, RIGHT?

3024
02:01:45,034 --> 02:01:47,036
NO. IT IS THE SAME

3025
02:01:47,036 --> 02:01:49,038
AS WITH CHANDLER-- WE'RE FRIENDS.

3026
02:01:49,038 --> 02:01:51,040
LET'S SAY WE WERE THE LAST TWO GUYS

3027
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:52,041
ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET

3028
02:01:52,041 --> 02:01:54,043
AND YOU HAD A GUN TO YOUR HEAD.

3029
02:01:54,043 --> 02:01:55,544
WHICH ONE WOULD YOU PICK?

3030
02:01:55,544 --> 02:01:56,545
WHICH ONE OF YOU

3031
02:01:57,046 --> 02:01:58,547
HAS THE GUN TO MY HEAD?

3032
02:02:02,051 --> 02:02:04,553
WELL, YES, IT'S KIND OF AN UNUSUAL HOUSE.

3033
02:02:04,553 --> 02:02:08,057
IT HAS, UM, THREE BEAUTIFUL BEDROOMS AND, UH, NO BATHS.

3034
02:02:08,057 --> 02:02:10,559
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE OCEAN IS RIGHT THERE.

3035
02:02:10,559 --> 02:02:12,061
IT'S, IT... WELL...

3036
02:02:12,061 --> 02:02:13,062
KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK.

3037
02:02:13,062 --> 02:02:14,563
OH. HANG ON A SECOND.

3038
02:02:14,563 --> 02:02:15,564
COME IN, COME IN.

3039
02:02:15,564 --> 02:02:18,067
ALL RIGHT, SO THINK ABOUT IT AND CALL ME BACK.

3040
02:02:19,068 --> 02:02:21,070
ARE YOU, UH, PHOEBE ABBOTT?

3041
02:02:21,070 --> 02:02:22,071
UH, YES.

3042
02:02:22,071 --> 02:02:23,572
SURPRISE, PHOEBE ABBOTT.

3043
02:02:23,572 --> 02:02:25,574
I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND'S DAUGHTER.

3044
02:02:27,576 --> 02:02:29,078
YOU'RE IRWIN'S DAUGHTER?

3045
02:02:29,078 --> 02:02:32,081
NO. I MEAN YOUR OLD BEST FRIEND.

3046
02:02:32,081 --> 02:02:33,582
HERE. LILY?

3047
02:02:33,582 --> 02:02:35,084
FROM HIGH SCHOOL? REMEMBER?

3048
02:02:35,084 --> 02:02:36,585
OH, GOD. LILY.

3049
02:02:36,585 --> 02:02:39,088
YES, OF COURSE I REMEMBER LILY.

3050
02:02:39,088 --> 02:02:40,589
I...

3051
02:02:40,589 --> 02:02:42,091
THEN YOU MUST BE...

3052
02:02:42,091 --> 02:02:43,592
PHOEBE, PHOEBE.

3053
02:02:43,592 --> 02:02:44,593
PHOEBE. YEAH.

3054
02:02:45,094 --> 02:02:46,595
SHE NAMED ME AFTER YOU, I GUESS.

3055
02:02:46,595 --> 02:02:47,596
UH HUH.

3056
02:02:47,596 --> 02:02:51,100
WOW. WELL, LOOK, THERE'S FRANK.

3057
02:02:51,100 --> 02:02:51,600
YEAH.

3058
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:52,601
YES! YES! YES!

3059
02:02:52,601 --> 02:02:53,602
THAT'S MY DAD!

3060
02:02:53,602 --> 02:02:55,104
THAT'S FRANK. YEAH!

3061
02:02:55,104 --> 02:02:57,106
I'M SORRY. I'M GETTING ALL FLINGY.

3062
02:02:57,106 --> 02:02:58,107
TAKE IT EASY.

3063
02:02:58,107 --> 02:03:01,110
IF YOU WANT, THERE'S COOKIES ON THE COUNTER.

3064
02:03:01,110 --> 02:03:03,112
OR SANGRIA. I COULD MAKE SANGRIA.

3065
02:03:03,112 --> 02:03:04,113
NO, NO.

3066
02:03:04,113 --> 02:03:05,114
COOKIES ARE GOOD.

3067
02:03:05,114 --> 02:03:06,615
THANKS.

3068
02:03:06,615 --> 02:03:08,117
SO, UM...

3069
02:03:08,117 --> 02:03:11,120
ANYWAY, UM, I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR MY FATHER

3070
02:03:11,120 --> 02:03:12,621
AND, UM...

3071
02:03:12,621 --> 02:03:15,124
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM HIM OR SEEN HIM?

3072
02:03:15,124 --> 02:03:16,625
OH, NO. I'M SORRY.

3073
02:03:16,625 --> 02:03:20,129
I... I GUESS I LOST TRACK OF EVERYBODY AFTER HIGH SCHOOL.

3074
02:03:20,129 --> 02:03:21,130
OH.

3075
02:03:21,630 --> 02:03:22,631
OKAY.

3076
02:03:22,631 --> 02:03:27,636
WELL, SO, TELL ME EVERYTHING ABOUT MY PARENTS. EVERYTHING.

3077
02:03:27,636 --> 02:03:29,638
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW, WE WERE ALWAYS TOGETHER.

3078
02:03:29,638 --> 02:03:30,639
IN FACT, THE OTHER KIDS

3079
02:03:30,639 --> 02:03:33,142
HAD A NICKNAME FOR THE THREE OF US.

3080
02:03:33,142 --> 02:03:34,643
OH, WHAT? WHAT WAS IT?

3081
02:03:34,643 --> 02:03:36,145
"THE THREE LOSERS."

3082
02:03:36,145 --> 02:03:38,147
OH, POOR LILY.

3083
02:03:38,147 --> 02:03:39,648
OH...

3084
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:42,151
YOU KNOW, I HEARD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

3085
02:03:42,151 --> 02:03:44,653
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN JUST TERRIBLE FOR YOU

3086
02:03:44,653 --> 02:03:46,655
LOSING YOUR MOTHER THAT WAY.

3087
02:03:46,655 --> 02:03:48,157
YEAH, NO.

3088
02:03:48,157 --> 02:03:50,159
IT WAS GREAT.

3089
02:03:59,668 --> 02:04:03,172
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT A REALLY GOOD RAINY DAY GAME IS?

3090
02:04:03,172 --> 02:04:04,173
WHAT?

3091
02:04:04,173 --> 02:04:05,174
I MEAN NAKED GAME?

3092
02:04:05,174 --> 02:04:06,675
STRIP POKER.

3093
02:04:06,675 --> 02:04:08,677
WE SHOULD TOTALLY PLAY STRIP POKER.

3094
02:04:08,677 --> 02:04:09,678
NO.

3095
02:04:09,678 --> 02:04:11,180
ARE YOU CRAZY? NO WAY.

3096
02:04:11,180 --> 02:04:13,182
COME ON, WHEN YOU GO AWAY, YOU HAVE TO PLAY.

3097
02:04:13,182 --> 02:04:14,683
IT'S, LIKE, A LAW.

3098
02:04:14,683 --> 02:04:16,185
IT'S NOT A LAW.

3099
02:04:16,185 --> 02:04:19,188
AND, AS LONG AS IT STAYS ATTACHED TO THAT TAX REFORM BILL

3100
02:04:19,188 --> 02:04:20,689
IT NEVER WILL BE, MISTER.

3101
02:04:21,690 --> 02:04:23,192
ALL DONE.

3102
02:04:23,192 --> 02:04:24,193
OH, THANK YOU.

3103
02:04:24,193 --> 02:04:26,195
OKAY, WHO'S NEXT?

3104
02:04:27,196 --> 02:04:28,697
NO.

3105
02:04:30,199 --> 02:04:31,700
NO WAY.

3106
02:04:31,700 --> 02:04:32,701
COME ON. PLEASE.

3107
02:04:32,701 --> 02:04:34,203
I'M BORED.

3108
02:04:34,203 --> 02:04:36,205
YOU LET ME DO IT ONCE BEFORE.

3109
02:04:39,708 --> 02:04:43,712
YEAH, WELL, IF, UH, IF THAT'S THE RULE THIS WEEKEND...

3110
02:04:45,214 --> 02:04:47,216
GET AWAY. TAKE IT LIKE A MAN.

3111
02:04:47,216 --> 02:04:48,717
NO! NO!

3112
02:04:48,717 --> 02:04:49,718
OH, COME ON.

3113
02:04:49,718 --> 02:04:51,720
BIG BULLIES!

3114
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:52,221

3115
02:04:52,221 --> 02:04:53,222

3116
02:04:53,222 --> 02:04:54,723
OW! OW!

3117
02:04:54,723 --> 02:04:55,724
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

3118
02:04:55,724 --> 02:04:57,226
NO, NO, NO...

3119
02:04:57,226 --> 02:04:58,727
 OW!

3120
02:05:02,231 --> 02:05:03,732
HEY.

3121
02:05:03,732 --> 02:05:04,733
HEY.

3122
02:05:04,733 --> 02:05:06,735
SO, HOW ARE WE DOING?

3123
02:05:06,735 --> 02:05:08,737
BORED AND BORED.

3124
02:05:10,239 --> 02:05:12,741
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT NAKED CARD GAME'S NEVER BORING?

3125
02:05:12,741 --> 02:05:13,742
 NO!

3126
02:05:15,244 --> 02:05:17,246
SO, WHAT'S PHOEBE LIKE?

3127
02:05:17,246 --> 02:05:18,747
I'M KIND, CARING AND SWEET.

3128
02:05:18,747 --> 02:05:19,748
WHAT'S MONICA LIKE?

3129
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:23,252
NO, THE OTHER PHOEBE--

3130
02:05:23,252 --> 02:05:25,254
THE ONE YOU WENT TO GO SEE.

3131
02:05:25,254 --> 02:05:27,756
OH. I THINK SHE KNOWS WHERE MY DAD IS.

3132
02:05:27,756 --> 02:05:29,258
REALLY? COOL.

3133
02:05:29,258 --> 02:05:30,259
WHERE IS HE?

3134
02:05:30,259 --> 02:05:31,260
ACTUALLY, SHE WAS PRETENDING

3135
02:05:31,260 --> 02:05:33,762
LIKE SHE HASN'T HEARD FROM HIM IN YEARS

3136
02:05:33,762 --> 02:05:35,764
BUT I FOUND THIS PICTURE ON HER FRIDGE.

3137
02:05:35,764 --> 02:05:37,266
AND LOOK, ISN'T THIS

3138
02:05:37,266 --> 02:05:38,767
WHAT HE WOULD LOOK LIKE NOW?

3139
02:05:38,767 --> 02:05:39,768
TOTALLY FAMILIAR.

3140
02:05:39,768 --> 02:05:41,270
OH, YEAH.

3141
02:05:41,270 --> 02:05:42,271
AH, YEAH.

3142
02:05:42,271 --> 02:05:43,272
YEAH.

3143
02:05:43,272 --> 02:05:44,773
WELL, WHY WOULD SHE LIE TO YOU?

3144
02:05:44,773 --> 02:05:47,276
I DON'T KNOW, BUT WE'RE HAVING DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT

3145
02:05:47,276 --> 02:05:49,278
SO I FIGURE SHE'S GOING TO TELL ME THEN.

3146
02:05:49,278 --> 02:05:52,281
MAYBE SHE JUST WANTED TO GIVE HIM TIME TO... BUY ME PRESENTS.

3147
02:05:52,281 --> 02:05:54,283
I DON'T KNOW.

3148
02:05:54,283 --> 02:05:55,284
SO, YOU'RE ALL BORED?

3149
02:05:55,284 --> 02:05:56,785

3150
02:05:56,785 --> 02:05:59,288
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO CLOSE MY EYES AND POINT TO SOMEONE

3151
02:05:59,288 --> 02:06:00,789
AND WHOEVER I POINT TO

3152
02:06:00,789 --> 02:06:02,791
HAS TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING FUN FOR US TO DO

3153
02:06:03,292 --> 02:06:04,293
AND WE HAVE TO DO IT.

3154
02:06:04,293 --> 02:06:06,295
OKAY. FAIR ENOUGH. FAIR ENOUGH.

3155
02:06:07,796 --> 02:06:09,798
OKAY.

3156
02:06:09,798 --> 02:06:12,301
OOH! YOU KNOW, WE COULD JUST DO THIS.

3157
02:06:14,303 --> 02:06:16,305
OKAY, UM...

3158
02:06:16,305 --> 02:06:18,807
WE ALL HAVE TO PLAY STRIP POKER.

3159
02:06:18,807 --> 02:06:20,809
AAH, YES!

3160
02:06:21,310 --> 02:06:22,811
CHANDLER, WHY, ALL OF A SUDDEN

3161
02:06:22,811 --> 02:06:24,313
DO YOU WANT TO PLAY STRIP POKER?

3162
02:06:24,313 --> 02:06:28,317
I THINK BECAUSE OF MARGARITAS THREE, FOUR AND NINE.

3163
02:06:30,819 --> 02:06:32,321
STRIP HAPPY DAYS GAME?!

3164
02:06:32,321 --> 02:06:34,823
YEAH. WELL, I COULDN'T FIND ANY CARDS

3165
02:06:34,823 --> 02:06:36,325
SO IT WAS EITHER THIS

3166
02:06:36,325 --> 02:06:38,827
OR STRIP BAG OF OLD KNITTING STUFF.

3167
02:06:38,827 --> 02:06:39,828
? DONE. ?

3168
02:06:40,829 --> 02:06:42,331
OKAY...

3169
02:06:42,331 --> 02:06:44,333
"FONZIE GIVES YOU TWO THUMBS UP.

3170
02:06:44,333 --> 02:06:45,834
COLLECT TWO COOL POINTS."

3171
02:06:46,335 --> 02:06:47,336
YEAH. YEAH.

3172
02:06:47,336 --> 02:06:48,337
MONICA, YOU GET

3173
02:06:48,337 --> 02:06:49,338
FIVE COOL POINTS.

3174
02:06:49,338 --> 02:06:50,839
YOU GET TO MAKE SOMEONE

3175
02:06:50,839 --> 02:06:52,341
TAKE OFF ONE ITEM OF CLOTHING.

3176
02:06:52,341 --> 02:06:53,842
IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET

3177
02:06:53,842 --> 02:06:55,344
BUT WE'RE ALL VERY EXCITED.

3178
02:06:55,344 --> 02:06:57,346
OKAY, COME ON.

3179
02:06:57,346 --> 02:07:00,849
DADDY NEEDS A NEW PAIR OF ELECTROMAGNETIC MICROSCOPES

3180
02:07:00,849 --> 02:07:03,352
FOR THE PREHISTORIC FORENSICS DEPARTMENT.

3181
02:07:07,856 --> 02:07:12,861
OKAY. "TAKE PINKY TUSCADERO UP TO INSPIRATION POINT.

3182
02:07:12,861 --> 02:07:14,863
COLLECT THREE COOL POINTS."

3183
02:07:14,863 --> 02:07:16,365
YEAH! WHICH GIVES ME FIVE

3184
02:07:16,365 --> 02:07:19,868
AND LET'S SEE WHO IS GOING TO LOSE THEIR CLOTHES.

3185
02:07:19,868 --> 02:07:21,370
UM...

3186
02:07:21,370 --> 02:07:23,872
I THINK I PICK OUR STRIP POKER SPONSOR

3187
02:07:23,872 --> 02:07:24,873
MR. JOEY TRIBBIANI.

3188
02:07:24,873 --> 02:07:26,875
WHOO HOO!

3189
02:07:26,875 --> 02:07:28,377

3190
02:07:28,377 --> 02:07:29,878
ALL RIGHT, RELAX.

3191
02:07:29,878 --> 02:07:30,879
IT'S JUST A SHOE.

3192
02:07:30,879 --> 02:07:33,382

3193
02:07:33,382 --> 02:07:35,384
OKAY, "YOUR BAND IS PLAYING AT ARNOLD'S.

3194
02:07:35,884 --> 02:07:37,886
COLLECT THREE COOL POINTS."

3195
02:07:37,886 --> 02:07:39,888
WHICH MEANS I HAVE FIVE

3196
02:07:39,888 --> 02:07:42,891
AND THAT MEANS I GET JOEY'S BOXERS.

3197
02:07:49,398 --> 02:07:50,899
FINE. GANG UP ON ME.

3198
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:53,902
I GOT YOU ALL RIGHT WHERE I WANT YOU.

3199
02:07:54,903 --> 02:07:55,904
COME ON, TAKE THEM OFF.

3200
02:07:55,904 --> 02:07:57,406
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF COLD

3201
02:07:57,406 --> 02:07:59,408
SO HOW ABOUT I KEEP MY BOXERS ON

3202
02:07:59,408 --> 02:08:01,910
AND GIVE YOU ALL A PEEK AT THE GOOD STUFF?

3203
02:08:01,910 --> 02:08:04,413
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO MAKE MORE MARGARITAS.

3204
02:08:04,413 --> 02:08:06,415
WHOA, HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

3205
02:08:06,415 --> 02:08:07,416
TRYING TO GET ME DRUNK?

3206
02:08:07,916 --> 02:08:09,418
I'M JUST MAKING MARGARITAS.

3207
02:08:11,420 --> 02:08:13,422
I THINK I'LL HELP HER OUT.

3208
02:08:15,924 --> 02:08:18,427
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

3209
02:08:18,427 --> 02:08:19,428
WHAT?

3210
02:08:19,428 --> 02:08:21,430
YOU PAINTING HIS TOENAILS...

3211
02:08:21,430 --> 02:08:22,431
OH, COME ON.

3212
02:08:22,431 --> 02:08:23,932
CHASING HIM AROUND THE ROOM...

3213
02:08:23,932 --> 02:08:25,434
MONICA, PLEASE.

3214
02:08:25,434 --> 02:08:26,935
HE'S TOTALLY FLIRTING WITH YOU, TOO.

3215
02:08:26,935 --> 02:08:28,937
HE IS, ISN'T HE?

3216
02:08:28,937 --> 02:08:30,939
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.

3217
02:08:30,939 --> 02:08:32,941
I MEAN, MAYBE IT'S JUST BEING HERE

3218
02:08:32,941 --> 02:08:34,443
AT THE BEACH TOGETHER OR...

3219
02:08:34,443 --> 02:08:36,445
I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S LIKE SOMETHING...

3220
02:08:37,446 --> 02:08:38,947
HEY. HI.

3221
02:08:38,947 --> 02:08:41,450

3222
02:08:41,450 --> 02:08:42,951
 HI, BONNIE.

3223
02:08:43,452 --> 02:08:44,453
HI.

3224
02:08:44,453 --> 02:08:46,955
MY BOSS LET ME OFF EARLY, SO I TOOK THE TRAIN.

3225
02:08:46,955 --> 02:08:48,957
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

3226
02:08:48,957 --> 02:08:51,460
WE'RE PLAYING STRIP HAPPY DAYS GAME.

3227
02:08:51,460 --> 02:08:54,963
COOL. I'LL CATCH UP.

3228
02:09:01,470 --> 02:09:06,475
SO, YOU STILL DON'T THINK I'M... BOYFRIEND MATERIAL?

3229
02:09:06,475 --> 02:09:07,976
HUH?

3230
02:09:07,976 --> 02:09:11,480
SAW YOU CHECKING ME OUT DURING THE GAME LAST NIGHT.

3231
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:13,482
YOU DIDN'T EVEN TAKE OFF YOUR PANTS.

3232
02:09:13,482 --> 02:09:14,983
YEAH, WELL, LUCKY FOR YOU.

3233
02:09:14,983 --> 02:09:16,985
WHAT?

3234
02:09:16,985 --> 02:09:18,487
I DON'T KNOW.

3235
02:09:19,988 --> 02:09:23,992
WELL, IS EVERYBODY ELSE HAVING JUST THE BEST TIME?

3236
02:09:23,992 --> 02:09:25,494
SHH! SHH!

3237
02:09:25,494 --> 02:09:26,995
JOEY'S ASLEEP.

3238
02:09:36,004 --> 02:09:37,506
AFTER HE PASSED OUT

3239
02:09:37,506 --> 02:09:40,008
WE PUT THE SAND AROUND HIM TO KEEP HIM WARM.

3240
02:09:42,010 --> 02:09:46,014
WELL, I ASSUME THE HAPPY COUPLE ISN'T UP YET.

3241
02:09:46,014 --> 02:09:48,016
DID YOU GUYS HEAR THEM LAST NIGHT?

3242
02:09:48,016 --> 02:09:49,017
OH, YEAH.

3243
02:09:49,017 --> 02:09:51,019
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING

3244
02:09:51,019 --> 02:09:54,022
BUT, AT ONE POINT, SEA TURTLES ACTUALLY CAME UP

3245
02:09:54,022 --> 02:09:56,024
TO THE HOUSE.

3246
02:09:56,024 --> 02:09:57,526
MORNING.

3247
02:09:57,526 --> 02:09:59,027
HEY. HOW DID EVERYBODY SLEEP?

3248
02:09:59,027 --> 02:10:01,029
OH, GREAT. LIKE A LOG.

3249
02:10:01,029 --> 02:10:04,032
 US, TOO.

3250
02:10:04,032 --> 02:10:05,534
I'M GOING FOR A WALK.

3251
02:10:10,539 --> 02:10:12,541
GOOD MORNING.

3252
02:10:12,541 --> 02:10:14,042
NICE BREASTS, BY THE WAY.

3253
02:10:24,553 --> 02:10:26,054
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

3254
02:10:26,054 --> 02:10:27,556
OH, UH, NOTHING.

3255
02:10:27,556 --> 02:10:30,058
I JUST FELT LIKE HANGING OUT HERE AND READING.

3256
02:10:30,058 --> 02:10:31,560
THE WATER WAS SO GREAT.

3257
02:10:32,060 --> 02:10:35,063
WE JUMPED OFF THIS PIER AND MY SUIT CAME OFF.

3258
02:10:35,063 --> 02:10:36,064
OH...

3259
02:10:36,064 --> 02:10:38,066
SORRY I MISSED THAT.

3260
02:10:38,066 --> 02:10:40,569
YEAH. JOEY AND CHANDLER SURE ARE FUNNY.

3261
02:10:40,569 --> 02:10:42,070
OH.

3262
02:10:42,571 --> 02:10:45,574
I THINK I BROUGHT BACK HALF OF THE BEACH IN MY HAIR.

3263
02:10:45,574 --> 02:10:47,576
IT WAS SO MUCH EASIER WHEN I USED

3264
02:10:47,576 --> 02:10:49,578
TO SHAVE MY HEAD.

3265
02:10:52,080 --> 02:10:54,082
YOU KNOW... I GOT TO TELL YOU

3266
02:10:54,082 --> 02:10:57,586
I JUST LOVED YOUR LOOK WHEN YOU WERE BALD.

3267
02:10:57,586 --> 02:10:58,587
REALLY? OH!

3268
02:10:58,587 --> 02:11:00,088
BECAUSE I THINK ABOUT

3269
02:11:00,088 --> 02:11:03,091
SHAVING IT ALL OFF AGAIN SOMETIMES.

3270
02:11:03,091 --> 02:11:04,092
REALLY?

3271
02:11:04,092 --> 02:11:05,093
YEAH.

3272
02:11:05,093 --> 02:11:07,596
I MEAN, YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD DO THAT.

3273
02:11:07,596 --> 02:11:08,597
YOU KNOW WHAT?

3274
02:11:08,597 --> 02:11:09,598
I SHOULD DO IT.

3275
02:11:09,598 --> 02:11:10,599
YEAH!

3276
02:11:10,599 --> 02:11:12,100
THANK YOU, RACHEL.

3277
02:11:12,100 --> 02:11:13,101
YOU ARE SO COOL.

3278
02:11:13,101 --> 02:11:16,104
OH, STOP.

3279
02:11:16,104 --> 02:11:17,606
NOW GO SHAVE THAT HEAD.

3280
02:11:17,606 --> 02:11:19,107
ALL RIGHT.

3281
02:11:25,113 --> 02:11:27,616
I KNOW I'VE ASKED YOU THIS BEFORE...

3282
02:11:27,616 --> 02:11:29,117
A HUNDRED TIMES BEFORE!

3283
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:34,122
HOW AM I NOT RIGHT FOR YOU?

3284
02:11:34,122 --> 02:11:36,124
I DON'T KNOW.

3285
02:11:36,124 --> 02:11:38,126
I I I LIKE GUYS LIKE RICHARD...

3286
02:11:38,126 --> 02:11:40,629
OR PETE... BEFORE HE WENT INSANE.

3287
02:11:40,629 --> 02:11:42,130
I DON'T KNOW.

3288
02:11:42,130 --> 02:11:44,132
JUST SOMEBODY... MORE... MATURE.

3289
02:11:44,132 --> 02:11:47,636
OH, SO NOW I'M NOT MATURE ENOUGH FOR YOU?

3290
02:11:47,636 --> 02:11:49,137
MONICA NEEDS SOMEBODY MORE MATURE!

3291
02:11:56,144 --> 02:11:58,146
WHAT'S THE MATTER, PHEEBS?

3292
02:11:58,146 --> 02:11:59,147
SHE CANCELED.

3293
02:11:59,147 --> 02:12:00,148
MY NAMESAKE CANCELED ON ME.

3294
02:12:00,649 --> 02:12:02,651
YEAH, SHE CLAIMS SHE HAD TO GO OUT OF TOWN SUDDENLY.

3295
02:12:02,651 --> 02:12:04,152
SHE'S AVOIDING ME.

3296
02:12:04,152 --> 02:12:06,655
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO TELL ME WHERE MY FATHER IS.

3297
02:12:06,655 --> 02:12:08,657
SHE KNOWS, AND SHE WON'T TELL ME.

3298
02:12:08,657 --> 02:12:10,659
AW, PHEEBS, THAT SUCKS.

3299
02:12:11,159 --> 02:12:15,664
YEAH, WELL, DON'T "AW, PHEEBS THAT SUCKS" ME YET.

3300
02:12:15,664 --> 02:12:16,665
WHERE YOU GOING?

3301
02:12:17,165 --> 02:12:18,166
WELL, SHE'S OUT OF TOWN

3302
02:12:18,166 --> 02:12:20,168
SO THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING IN HER HOUSE

3303
02:12:20,168 --> 02:12:21,670
THAT TELLS ME WHERE MY FATHER IS.

3304
02:12:21,670 --> 02:12:23,672
UH, PHEEBS, SOME PEOPLE CALL THAT

3305
02:12:23,672 --> 02:12:25,173
BREAKING AND ENTERING.

3306
02:12:25,173 --> 02:12:26,675
WELL, ARE ANY OF THOSE PEOPLE HERE?

3307
02:12:26,675 --> 02:12:28,176
OH, NO. NO, NO.

3308
02:12:28,176 --> 02:12:31,680
OKAY. LOOK, I'LL DO SOMETHING NICE, OKAY?

3309
02:12:31,680 --> 02:12:32,681
I'LL I'LL...

3310
02:12:33,181 --> 02:12:35,183
FILL HER ICE TRAYS. GOOD.

3311
02:12:36,685 --> 02:12:38,186
HEY, EVERYBODY.

3312
02:12:38,186 --> 02:12:39,688
WOW!

3313
02:12:40,689 --> 02:12:41,690
WHA...?!

3314
02:12:41,690 --> 02:12:43,191

3315
02:12:43,191 --> 02:12:45,193
LOOK WHAT YOU DID.

3316
02:12:46,194 --> 02:12:48,196
YOU WANT TO TOUCH IT?

3317
02:12:48,196 --> 02:12:49,197
NO.

3318
02:12:49,197 --> 02:12:50,198
BUT IT'S GREAT.

3319
02:12:50,198 --> 02:12:52,200
COME ON, TOUCH IT.

3320
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:53,702
OKAY.

3321
02:12:56,204 --> 02:12:58,707
YOU CAN FEEL ALL THE BONES IN YOUR SKULL.

3322
02:13:00,208 --> 02:13:01,209
KISS IT.

3323
02:13:01,710 --> 02:13:02,711
NO. THAT...

3324
02:13:02,711 --> 02:13:04,212
NO, THAT'S OKAY.

3325
02:13:09,718 --> 02:13:10,719
HI.

3326
02:13:10,719 --> 02:13:11,720
HI.

3327
02:13:11,720 --> 02:13:13,722
I WAS HAVING A LITTLE CHAT WITH BONNIE

3328
02:13:13,722 --> 02:13:15,223
AND, UH, GUESS WHAT.

3329
02:13:15,223 --> 02:13:17,726
SHE HAPPENED TO BRING UP, YOU KNOW, WHO WAS BEHIND

3330
02:13:17,726 --> 02:13:19,728
THE WHOLE, UM, HEAD SHAVING IDEA.

3331
02:13:19,728 --> 02:13:20,729
NOW, WHO WAS IT?

3332
02:13:20,729 --> 02:13:21,730
OH, THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT.

3333
02:13:21,730 --> 02:13:22,731
IT WAS YOU.

3334
02:13:22,731 --> 02:13:25,233
LOOK, THAT...

3335
02:13:25,233 --> 02:13:26,735
THAT WAS HER IDEA.

3336
02:13:26,735 --> 02:13:28,236
I JUST GAVE HER A NUDGE.

3337
02:13:28,236 --> 02:13:29,738
SHE SAID

3338
02:13:29,738 --> 02:13:31,239
YOU GAVE HER THE RAZOR.

3339
02:13:32,741 --> 02:13:33,742
HEY.

3340
02:13:33,742 --> 02:13:34,743
HEY.

3341
02:13:34,743 --> 02:13:37,245
SO, ANYONE UP FOR A MIDNIGHT DIP IN THE OCEAN?

3342
02:13:37,245 --> 02:13:38,246
UH, I'M GOOD.

3343
02:13:38,246 --> 02:13:39,247
NO, THANKS.

3344
02:13:39,247 --> 02:13:40,749
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU IN A BIT.

3345
02:13:40,749 --> 02:13:43,251
OKAY, HAVE FUN. BYE!

3346
02:13:43,251 --> 02:13:44,252
COME ON, SEE?

3347
02:13:44,252 --> 02:13:47,255
SHE DOESN'T LOOK... THAT BAD.

3348
02:13:47,255 --> 02:13:51,259
YOU CAN SEE THE MOONLIGHT BOUNCING OFF HER HEAD.

3349
02:13:51,259 --> 02:13:53,762
WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING?

3350
02:13:54,262 --> 02:13:54,763
I DON'T KNOW.

3351
02:13:55,263 --> 02:13:56,264
YOU DON'T KNOW?

3352
02:13:56,264 --> 02:13:57,265
RACH, YOU BALDED MY GIRLFRIEND.

3353
02:13:57,265 --> 02:13:58,767
ALL RIGHT, ROSS!

3354
02:13:58,767 --> 02:14:02,771
DO YOU THINK IT'S EASY FOR ME TO SEE YOU WITH SOMEBODY ELSE?

3355
02:14:02,771 --> 02:14:04,272
YOU KNOW WHAT?

3356
02:14:04,272 --> 02:14:06,274
HEY, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO ENDED IT, REMEMBER?

3357
02:14:06,274 --> 02:14:08,276
YEAH, BECAUSE I WAS MAD AT YOU.

3358
02:14:08,276 --> 02:14:10,278
NOT BECAUSE I STOPPED LOVING YOU!

3359
02:14:10,278 --> 02:14:12,781
YOU STILL LOVE ME?

3360
02:14:12,781 --> 02:14:15,784
NO.

3361
02:14:15,784 --> 02:14:17,285
YOU STILL LOVE ME.

3362
02:14:17,285 --> 02:14:18,787
OH. YEAH?

3363
02:14:18,787 --> 02:14:19,788
SO?

3364
02:14:19,788 --> 02:14:20,789
YOU LOVE ME.

3365
02:14:20,789 --> 02:14:22,290
NO.

3366
02:14:22,290 --> 02:14:23,792
N...

3367
02:14:25,794 --> 02:14:26,795
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

3368
02:14:26,795 --> 02:14:27,796
WHAT ARE YOU...?

3369
02:14:27,796 --> 02:14:29,297
I MEAN, DO YOU WANT TO...

3370
02:14:29,297 --> 02:14:30,799
GET BACK TOGETHER?

3371
02:14:30,799 --> 02:14:31,800
NO.

3372
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:33,301
MAYBE.

3373
02:14:33,301 --> 02:14:35,303
I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW.

3374
02:14:37,305 --> 02:14:38,807
ROSS...

3375
02:14:40,308 --> 02:14:44,312
I STILL CAN'T FORGIVE YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID.

3376
02:14:44,312 --> 02:14:46,314
I JUST... BUT SOMETIMES, WHEN I'M WITH YOU

3377
02:14:46,815 --> 02:14:47,816
I JUST... I FEEL...

3378
02:14:47,816 --> 02:14:49,317
WHAT?

3379
02:14:49,317 --> 02:14:53,321
I JUST... I FEEL...

3380
02:14:53,321 --> 02:14:54,823
I JUST...

3381
02:14:54,823 --> 02:14:56,324
WHAT?

3382
02:14:56,324 --> 02:14:57,826
I FEEL...

3383
02:15:05,333 --> 02:15:06,835
NO.

3384
02:15:06,835 --> 02:15:07,836
I DON'T CARE.

3385
02:15:07,836 --> 02:15:10,839
I'M NOT PLAYING ONE ON ONE STRIP POKER WITH YOU

3386
02:15:10,839 --> 02:15:12,340
FOR PRACTICE.

3387
02:15:12,340 --> 02:15:13,842
BUT I MADE CARDS.

3388
02:15:15,844 --> 02:15:17,345
WELL...

3389
02:15:17,345 --> 02:15:19,848
GOOD NIGHT.

3390
02:15:19,848 --> 02:15:21,850
I'M GOING UPSTAIRS.

3391
02:15:21,850 --> 02:15:23,852
GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT.

3392
02:15:30,358 --> 02:15:32,360
WANT TO PLAY STRIP POKER FOR PRACTICE?

3393
02:15:47,876 --> 02:15:49,878
OW! OH!

3394
02:15:50,378 --> 02:15:52,881
MY ASS.

3395
02:15:55,383 --> 02:15:56,384
OKAY.

3396
02:15:57,385 --> 02:15:59,387
OKAY.

3397
02:15:59,387 --> 02:16:01,389
OKAY.

3398
02:16:02,390 --> 02:16:03,892
OOH! SHH!

3399
02:16:08,396 --> 02:16:10,899

3400
02:16:12,901 --> 02:16:14,903
SHH! SHH!

3401
02:16:18,406 --> 02:16:21,409

3402
02:16:21,409 --> 02:16:22,911
SHH!

3403
02:16:28,917 --> 02:16:30,418

3404
02:16:30,418 --> 02:16:32,420
NO! OH! IT'S ME! IT'S ME!

3405
02:16:32,921 --> 02:16:34,422
I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE ANY NOISE!

3406
02:16:34,422 --> 02:16:35,924
THEN DON'T BREAK IN!

3407
02:16:35,924 --> 02:16:37,926
I'M SORRY.

3408
02:16:37,926 --> 02:16:40,428
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

3409
02:16:40,428 --> 02:16:44,432
I... I... CAME TO FILL YOUR ICE CUBE TRAY.

3410
02:16:45,433 --> 02:16:46,935
WHAT?

3411
02:16:46,935 --> 02:16:48,436
UM...

3412
02:16:48,436 --> 02:16:49,938
OKAY.

3413
02:16:49,938 --> 02:16:52,941
OKAY, LOOK...

3414
02:16:52,941 --> 02:16:54,943
I TOOK THIS PICTURE FROM YOUR FRIDGE, OKAY?

3415
02:16:55,443 --> 02:16:57,445
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THIS IS MY FATHER.

3416
02:16:57,445 --> 02:16:58,446
THIS IS FRANK BUFFAY

3417
02:16:58,446 --> 02:17:00,949
AND YOU ARE STANDING RIGHT THERE NEXT TO HIM.

3418
02:17:00,949 --> 02:17:03,952
NOW, LOOK, I DESERVE TO KNOW WHERE I CAME FROM, ALL RIGHT?

3419
02:17:03,952 --> 02:17:06,454
SO IF YOU CAN HELP ME FIND MY FATHER

3420
02:17:06,454 --> 02:17:07,455
THEN YOU SHOULD.

3421
02:17:07,455 --> 02:17:09,457
OTHERWISE, YOU'RE JUST... MEAN.

3422
02:17:11,960 --> 02:17:14,462
SO JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH.

3423
02:17:14,462 --> 02:17:17,966
ALL RIGHT, THE MAN IN THAT PICTURE

3424
02:17:17,966 --> 02:17:20,969
IS CHUCK MANGIONE.

3425
02:17:21,970 --> 02:17:25,974
MY FATHER IS CHUCK MANGIONE?

3426
02:17:25,974 --> 02:17:27,976
NO, NO. THAT'S JUST CHUCK MANGIONE.

3427
02:17:27,976 --> 02:17:29,978
I SOLD HIM A HOUSE LAST YEAR.

3428
02:17:29,978 --> 02:17:30,979
AND I'M VERY SORRY

3429
02:17:30,979 --> 02:17:34,482
BUT I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE YOUR FATHER IS.

3430
02:17:34,482 --> 02:17:36,484
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH.

3431
02:17:36,484 --> 02:17:37,986
OH.

3432
02:17:37,986 --> 02:17:40,989
BUT, UM, YOU'RE RIGHT.

3433
02:17:40,989 --> 02:17:44,492
I THINK THAT A PERSON SHOULD KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM.

3434
02:17:44,492 --> 02:17:49,497
WHICH IS WHY I, UH...

3435
02:17:49,497 --> 02:17:51,499
UH...

3436
02:17:53,501 --> 02:17:56,004
OKAY...

3437
02:17:56,004 --> 02:17:58,006
I'M YOUR MOTHER.

3438
02:18:00,508 --> 02:18:02,510
HEH?

3439
02:18:03,011 --> 02:18:05,513
YOU KNOW, I WANTED TO TELL YOU YESTERDAY

3440
02:18:05,513 --> 02:18:08,516
BUT I JUST... YOU KNOW, I FELT ALL FLOOPY.

3441
02:18:10,018 --> 02:18:11,019
 I'M TELLING YOU

3442
02:18:11,519 --> 02:18:13,521
YOU GUYS ARE TOTALLY GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

3443
02:18:13,521 --> 02:18:14,522
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

3444
02:18:15,023 --> 02:18:16,524
SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT SHE WANTS.

3445
02:18:16,524 --> 02:18:18,526
RACHEL'S STILL MAD ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

3446
02:18:18,526 --> 02:18:21,029
OKAY, WELL, THEN YOU GOT TO BACK AWAY, ALL RIGHT?

3447
02:18:21,029 --> 02:18:23,031
YOU DON'T NEED THAT KIND OF HURT.

3448
02:18:23,031 --> 02:18:24,032
TAKE IT FROM A GUY WHO'S...

3449
02:18:24,032 --> 02:18:28,036
NEVER HAD A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP.

3450
02:18:28,036 --> 02:18:29,537
I KNOW, BUT...

3451
02:18:29,537 --> 02:18:33,041
I REALLY WANT TO GO UP THERE AND FINISH THAT KISS.

3452
02:18:33,041 --> 02:18:34,042
HEY.

3453
02:18:34,042 --> 02:18:36,044
YOU GUYS, THE WATER IS GREAT.

3454
02:18:36,044 --> 02:18:37,545
YOU SHOULD REALLY GO IN.

3455
02:18:37,545 --> 02:18:38,546
OH, UH, NO, THANKS.

3456
02:18:38,546 --> 02:18:40,048
I JUST HAD AN M & M.

3457
02:18:40,048 --> 02:18:41,049
OKAY.

3458
02:18:41,049 --> 02:18:42,050
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

3459
02:18:42,050 --> 02:18:44,552
GOOD NIGHT.

3460
02:18:45,053 --> 02:18:46,054
DON'T BE TOO LONG.

3461
02:18:46,054 --> 02:18:49,057
OKEY DOKEY.

3462
02:18:49,057 --> 02:18:51,559
THERE IS NOT ONE HAIR ON THAT HEAD.

3463
02:18:52,060 --> 02:18:53,561
HEY, IT'LL GROW BACK, RIGHT?

3464
02:18:53,561 --> 02:18:56,064
AND SHE'S SHE'S REALLY FUN AND SHE'S COOL

3465
02:18:56,064 --> 02:18:58,566
AND AND I'M FINALLY MOVING ON, YOU KNOW?

3466
02:18:58,566 --> 02:19:01,569
I MEAN, GETTING OVER RACHEL WAS SO... AH...

3467
02:19:01,569 --> 02:19:03,571
YOU KNOW, I'M FINALLY FEELING SANE AGAIN.

3468
02:19:03,571 --> 02:19:07,575
AND NOW, IF I GO UP THERE AND I KISS HER AND...

3469
02:19:07,575 --> 02:19:09,577
GOD, I WANT TO KISS HER.

3470
02:19:09,577 --> 02:19:11,579
AND AND IT DOESN'T WORK OUT, RIGHT

3471
02:19:11,579 --> 02:19:14,582
DO I REALLY WANT TO PUT MYSELF THROUGH THAT AGAIN?

3472
02:19:14,582 --> 02:19:16,084
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

3473
02:19:16,084 --> 02:19:17,585
IF YOU GO WITH BONNIE TONIGHT

3474
02:19:17,585 --> 02:19:19,587
YOU'RE DOING THE SMART, HEALTHY THING

3475
02:19:19,587 --> 02:19:22,090
AND MOVING ON, RIGHT?

3476
02:19:22,090 --> 02:19:25,093
AND IF YOU GO WITH RACHEL, BONNIE'S FREE TONIGHT?

3477
02:19:38,606 --> 02:19:40,608
HI.

3478
02:19:46,114 --> 02:19:47,615

3479
02:19:47,615 --> 02:19:49,617
HI, THERE.

3480
02:19:49,617 --> 02:19:53,121
THAT'S THAT WEIRD VOICE AGAIN.

3481
02:19:53,121 --> 02:19:55,123
OKAY, OKAY. LET ME TRY IT AGAIN.

3482
02:19:55,123 --> 02:19:57,625
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DATE THIS NEXT GUY, I SWEAR.

3483
02:19:57,625 --> 02:19:59,127
OKAY, COME ON.

3484
02:20:01,129 --> 02:20:02,630

3485
02:20:02,630 --> 02:20:06,634
I CAN ONLY DO IT WITH THE VOICE NOW.

3486
02:20:06,634 --> 02:20:08,136
OKAY, OKAY.

3487
02:20:08,136 --> 02:20:10,138
CLOSE THE DOOR. CLOSE THE DOOR.

3488
02:20:11,139 --> 02:20:12,640

3489
02:20:14,642 --> 02:20:16,144
HI. I'M DORF.

3490
02:20:16,144 --> 02:20:18,146
YOUR DATE FOR THE EVENING.

3491
02:20:18,146 --> 02:20:19,147
OH, COME ON--

3492
02:20:19,147 --> 02:20:22,150
DORF ON DATING? THAT'S GOOD STUFF.
