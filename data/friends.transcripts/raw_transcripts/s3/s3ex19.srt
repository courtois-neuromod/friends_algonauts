2886
01:56:15,572 --> 01:56:16,573
HERE YOU GO.

2887
01:56:16,573 --> 01:56:18,074
THANK YOU.

2888
01:56:18,074 --> 01:56:20,076
SAY, RACHEL, I WAS WONDERING

2889
01:56:20,076 --> 01:56:24,080
IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO TO A MOVIE WITH ME SOMETIME...

2890
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:25,582
AS MY LOVER.

2891
01:56:27,584 --> 01:56:28,585
HMM, TOO OUT THERE.

2892
01:56:29,085 --> 01:56:30,086
MAYBE YOU'D JUST LIKE

2893
01:56:30,587 --> 01:56:33,089
TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT WITH ME SOMETIME...

2894
01:56:33,089 --> 01:56:35,091
AS MY LOVER.

2895
01:56:36,593 --> 01:56:38,595
HI.

2896
01:56:38,595 --> 01:56:39,596
HI.

2897
01:56:39,596 --> 01:56:41,097
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO SHOPPING.

2898
01:56:41,097 --> 01:56:42,599
GOT A POSITIVE BALANCE ON MY CREDIT CARD.

2899
01:56:42,599 --> 01:56:44,601
I WANT TO USE IT UP BEFORE CITIBANK GOES UNDER.

2900
01:56:44,601 --> 01:56:46,102
GOOD IDEA. GOOD IDEA.

2901
01:56:46,102 --> 01:56:48,104
UM... BEFORE WE GO, YOU KNOW

2902
01:56:48,104 --> 01:56:50,607
THERE'S.... THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO SAY.

2903
01:56:50,607 --> 01:56:52,108
OH, OKAY.

2904
01:56:55,612 --> 01:56:57,614
I'VE KIND OF HAD THIS, UH...

2905
01:56:57,614 --> 01:56:59,115
THIS CRUSH ON YOU

2906
01:56:59,115 --> 01:57:00,617
BUT SINCE YOU WERE WITH ROSS

2907
01:57:00,617 --> 01:57:03,119
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT

2908
01:57:03,119 --> 01:57:04,621
BUT NOW THAT YOU'RE NOT

2909
01:57:04,621 --> 01:57:07,123
I'D REALLY LIKE TO ASK YOU OUT SOMETIME

2910
01:57:07,123 --> 01:57:09,626
SO, THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING...

2911
01:57:09,626 --> 01:57:11,127
NOW.

2912
01:57:14,631 --> 01:57:17,133
WOW. UM...

2913
01:57:17,133 --> 01:57:19,135

2914
01:57:19,135 --> 01:57:22,639

2915
01:57:27,143 --> 01:57:28,645
I DROPPED A CUP.

2916
01:57:35,151 --> 01:57:40,156
?  ?

2917
01:57:40,657 --> 01:57:42,659
?  ?

2918
01:57:42,659 --> 01:57:45,662
?  ?

2919
01:57:45,662 --> 01:57:49,165
?  ?

2920
01:57:49,165 --> 01:57:51,668
?  ?

2921
01:57:51,668 --> 01:57:55,171
?  ?

2922
01:57:55,171 --> 01:57:59,175
?  ?

2923
01:57:59,175 --> 01:58:01,177
?  ?

2924
01:58:01,177 --> 01:58:03,680
?  ?

2925
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:06,182
?  ?

2926
01:58:06,182 --> 01:58:08,685
?  ?

2927
01:58:08,685 --> 01:58:15,191
?  ?

2928
01:58:17,694 --> 01:58:19,195
THAT'S WHY, WITHIN A FEW YEARS

2929
01:58:19,195 --> 01:58:20,697
THAT VOICE RECOGNITION IS GOING

2930
01:58:20,697 --> 01:58:21,698
TO BE PRETTY MUCH STANDARD

2931
01:58:21,698 --> 01:58:23,199
ON ANY COMPUTER YOU BUY.

2932
01:58:23,199 --> 01:58:26,202
SO YOU CAN BE, LIKE, "WASH MY CAR," "CLEAN MY ROOM."

2933
01:58:26,202 --> 01:58:28,705
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS

2934
01:58:28,705 --> 01:58:31,207
BUT IT WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

2935
01:58:31,207 --> 01:58:33,710
WOW. WILL IT BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE MY VOICE

2936
01:58:33,710 --> 01:58:36,713
IF I TALK LIKE THIS?

2937
01:58:36,713 --> 01:58:40,216
IT'LL UNDERSTAND YOU, BUT IT'S GOING

2938
01:58:40,216 --> 01:58:42,218
TO MAKE FUN OF YOU.

2939
01:58:42,218 --> 01:58:43,720
OH, THIS IS SO GREAT.

2940
01:58:43,720 --> 01:58:45,221
YEAH, IT WAS.

2941
01:58:46,723 --> 01:58:47,724
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

2942
01:58:49,726 --> 01:58:50,727
BYE.

2943
01:58:56,733 --> 01:58:58,735
HELLO, PEOPLE WHO DO NOT LIVE HERE.

2944
01:58:58,735 --> 01:59:01,738
HI. HELLO.

2945
01:59:03,239 --> 01:59:06,242
I GAVE YOU A KEY FOR EMERGENCIES.

2946
01:59:06,242 --> 01:59:08,244
WE WERE OUT OF DORITOS.

2947
01:59:08,745 --> 01:59:10,747
 HEY, HOW'D THE DATE GO

2948
01:59:10,747 --> 01:59:12,749
WITH MR. MILLIONAIRE?

2949
01:59:12,749 --> 01:59:16,252
"MR. MILLIONAIRE, NEW FROM SNOOTY PLAYTHINGS.

2950
01:59:16,252 --> 01:59:19,756
THIRD WIFE SOLD SEPARATELY."

2951
01:59:19,756 --> 01:59:20,757
HE'S GREAT.

2952
01:59:20,757 --> 01:59:22,759
I MEAN, WE HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME TOGETHER.

2953
01:59:22,759 --> 01:59:24,761
HE'S SO FUNNY AND SO SWEET

2954
01:59:24,761 --> 01:59:28,264
AND I'M NOT ATTRACTED TO HIM AT ALL.

2955
01:59:28,264 --> 01:59:29,265
STILL?

2956
01:59:29,265 --> 01:59:30,266
NO!

2957
01:59:30,266 --> 01:59:31,768
IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

2958
01:59:31,768 --> 01:59:34,270
IN EVERY OTHER WAY, HE'S LIKE THE PERFECT GUY.

2959
01:59:34,270 --> 01:59:35,772
HE HAS EVERYTHING.

2960
01:59:35,772 --> 01:59:38,274
PLUS, HE ACTUALLY HAS EVERYTHING.

2961
01:59:38,274 --> 01:59:41,277
LIFE SIZED IMPERIAL STORM TROOPERS FROM SHARPER IMAGE?

2962
01:59:41,277 --> 01:59:43,780
TWO.

2963
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:46,282
WOW. CAN JOEY AND I PUT THEM ON AND FIGHT?

2964
01:59:48,284 --> 01:59:49,786
OH, MOMMY!

2965
01:59:49,786 --> 01:59:51,788
OH, DADDY!

2966
01:59:51,788 --> 01:59:53,790
I AM A BIG OLD BADDY!

2967
01:59:53,790 --> 01:59:54,791
OH, MOMMY!

2968
01:59:54,791 --> 01:59:56,292
OH, DADDY!

2969
01:59:56,292 --> 01:59:57,794
I AM A BIG OLD BADDY!

2970
02:00:00,797 --> 02:00:04,801
I GUESS HE MUST HAVE GOTTEN THE PART IN THAT PLAY.

2971
02:00:04,801 --> 02:00:07,303
EITHER THAT OR GLORIA ESTEFAN WAS RIGHT.

2972
02:00:07,303 --> 02:00:09,806
EVENTUALLY, THE RHYTHM IS GOING TO GET YOU.

2973
02:00:15,311 --> 02:00:16,813
JOE, HOW'S IT GOING?

2974
02:00:16,813 --> 02:00:18,314
GOOD.

2975
02:00:21,317 --> 02:00:23,319
HEY.

2976
02:00:23,319 --> 02:00:24,320
HI.

2977
02:00:24,821 --> 02:00:26,823
OH, SO YOU'RE PLAYING ADRIENNE, HUH?

2978
02:00:26,823 --> 02:00:29,826
YES. ARE YOU ONE OF THE RETARDED COUSINS?

2979
02:00:31,327 --> 02:00:33,329
NO, NO. I'M PLAYING YOUR HUSBAND, VICTOR.

2980
02:00:33,329 --> 02:00:34,831
I'M JOEY TRIBBIANI.

2981
02:00:34,831 --> 02:00:36,332
HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

2982
02:00:36,332 --> 02:00:38,334
KATE MILLER.

2983
02:00:44,340 --> 02:00:47,343
SO, THE PLAY'S PRETTY GREAT, HUH?

2984
02:00:47,343 --> 02:00:49,846
OH, YEAH. I LOVE JENNIFER BANBERRY'S WORK.

2985
02:00:49,846 --> 02:00:50,847
SHE'S SO BRILLIANTLY INCISIVE

2986
02:00:50,847 --> 02:00:52,348
WHEN IT COMES TO DECONSTRUCTING

2987
02:00:52,849 --> 02:00:54,350
THE PSYCHE OF THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS.

2988
02:00:54,350 --> 02:00:55,852
OH, FORGET ABOUT IT.

2989
02:00:55,852 --> 02:00:56,853
SHE ROCKS!

2990
02:01:02,358 --> 02:01:03,860
WHERE DO I KNOW YOU FROM?

2991
02:01:05,862 --> 02:01:08,865
DR. DRAKE RAMORAY?

2992
02:01:08,865 --> 02:01:10,867
DAYS OF OUR LIVES?

2993
02:01:10,867 --> 02:01:13,870
VOTED MOST DATEABLE NEUROSURGEON BY TEEN BEAT?

2994
02:01:13,870 --> 02:01:16,372
NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

2995
02:01:17,874 --> 02:01:19,375
SO, YOU'RE A SOAP ACTOR.

2996
02:01:19,375 --> 02:01:21,878
WELL, THIS MUST BE PRETTY EXCITING FOR YOU

2997
02:01:21,878 --> 02:01:23,379
BEING IN A REAL PLAY, HMM?

2998
02:01:23,379 --> 02:01:24,881
HEY, I'VE DONE PLAYS BEFORE.

2999
02:01:24,881 --> 02:01:26,382
I'M A SERIOUS ACTOR.

3000
02:01:27,383 --> 02:01:28,885
THAT INFOMERCIAL...

3001
02:01:30,887 --> 02:01:32,889
FOR THE MILK CARTON SPOUT THING.

3002
02:01:32,889 --> 02:01:35,892
YOU'RE THE GUY WHO DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO POUR MILK.

3003
02:01:37,393 --> 02:01:39,395
SEE, I ACTUALLY CANPOUR MILK

3004
02:01:39,395 --> 02:01:41,397
BUT I GOT YOU BELIEVING THAT I COULDN'T.

3005
02:01:41,898 --> 02:01:43,399
NOW, SEE, THAT'S ACTING.

3006
02:01:43,399 --> 02:01:45,902
RIGHT. AT THE END, YOU CHOKED ON A COOKIE.

3007
02:01:45,902 --> 02:01:48,404
YEAH. THAT WAS REAL.

3008
02:01:50,406 --> 02:01:52,909
WOW. I CANNOT BELIEVE MARK ASKED YOU OUT.

3009
02:01:52,909 --> 02:01:53,910
I KNOW.

3010
02:01:53,910 --> 02:01:55,912
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TELL HIM?

3011
02:01:55,912 --> 02:01:58,414
WELL, I TOLD HIM I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT

3012
02:01:58,414 --> 02:01:59,916
BUT I'M GOING TO TELL HIM NO.

3013
02:01:59,916 --> 02:02:01,918
 HUH.

3014
02:02:01,918 --> 02:02:04,420
I THINK I'D SAY NO TO ANYBODY RIGHT NOW.

3015
02:02:07,924 --> 02:02:09,926
OH, BUT IT WAS SO STRANGE.

3016
02:02:09,926 --> 02:02:11,427
I MEAN, I'M STANDING THERE

3017
02:02:11,427 --> 02:02:13,429
WITH THIS CHARMING, CUTE GUY

3018
02:02:13,429 --> 02:02:15,932
WHO'S ASKING ME TO GO OUT WITH HIM--

3019
02:02:15,932 --> 02:02:17,433
WHICH I AM ALLOWED TO DO--

3020
02:02:17,934 --> 02:02:19,435
AND I FELT GUILTY, YOU KNOW

3021
02:02:19,435 --> 02:02:22,438
LIKE I'D BE CHEATING ON ROSS OR SOMETHING.

3022
02:02:22,438 --> 02:02:24,941
WOW. SO, OKAY

3023
02:02:24,941 --> 02:02:27,944
MAYBE THAT MEANS THAT YOU'RE NOT OVER ROSS YET

3024
02:02:27,944 --> 02:02:30,446
AND YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH YOUR FATHER.

3025
02:02:33,950 --> 02:02:35,952
I DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH MY FATHER.

3026
02:02:35,952 --> 02:02:37,954
OKAY, SO IT'S PROBABLY JUST THE ROSS THING THEN.

3027
02:02:40,456 --> 02:02:42,458
I HATE THIS WOMAN. I HATE HER!

3028
02:02:42,458 --> 02:02:43,960
SHE TOLD EVERYONE IN THE COMPANY

3029
02:02:43,960 --> 02:02:44,961
ABOUT THAT INFOMERCIAL

3030
02:02:44,961 --> 02:02:46,963
AND NOW THEY ALL KEEP ASKING ME

3031
02:02:46,963 --> 02:02:48,965
TO OPEN THEIR DRINKS, OKAY

3032
02:02:48,965 --> 02:02:50,466
AND WHENEVER I CAN'T DO IT

3033
02:02:50,466 --> 02:02:52,969
THEY'RE ALL, LIKE... LIKE, LAUGHING AT ME.

3034
02:02:54,470 --> 02:02:56,472
HELLO.

3035
02:02:56,472 --> 02:02:57,974
HEY!

3036
02:02:57,974 --> 02:03:00,977
SO RACHEL CALLED.

3037
02:03:00,977 --> 02:03:02,979
WANTS TO SEE ME.

3038
02:03:03,479 --> 02:03:05,982
GOING OVER IN A MINUTE.

3039
02:03:05,982 --> 02:03:07,984
WOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE WANTS?

3040
02:03:07,984 --> 02:03:11,487
WELL, MAYBE THE CRAZY FOG HAS LIFTED

3041
02:03:11,487 --> 02:03:15,491
AND SHE REALIZES THAT LIFE WITHOUT ME SUCKS.

3042
02:03:15,491 --> 02:03:16,993
IT'S POSSIBLE.

3043
02:03:16,993 --> 02:03:18,494
YOU ARE VERY LOVABLE.

3044
02:03:18,494 --> 02:03:20,997
I'D MISS YOU IF I BROKE UP WITH YOU.

3045
02:03:22,999 --> 02:03:24,500
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE SUPPORTIVE.

3046
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:27,503
WELL, BE SUPPORTIVE LIKE A GUY.

3047
02:03:27,503 --> 02:03:30,506
IF I BROKE UP WITH YOU, I'D MISS YOU.

3048
02:03:34,510 --> 02:03:36,012
HI.

3049
02:03:36,012 --> 02:03:38,014
HI.

3050
02:03:38,014 --> 02:03:41,017
YOU, UH... WANTED TO SEE ME?

3051
02:03:44,020 --> 02:03:46,522
YEAH.

3052
02:03:46,522 --> 02:03:49,025
UH, HERE'S A BOX OF YOUR STUFF.

3053
02:03:50,526 --> 02:03:52,528
WHAT?

3054
02:03:52,528 --> 02:03:55,031
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST, LIKE, HATS AND SHIRT AND CDs.

3055
02:03:55,031 --> 02:03:57,533
JUST SORT OF STUFF THAT YOU'VE LEFT HERE.

3056
02:03:57,533 --> 02:03:58,534
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

3057
02:03:59,035 --> 02:04:00,536
ARE YOU TRYING TO HURT ME

3058
02:04:00,536 --> 02:04:02,038
OR SOMETHING?

3059
02:04:02,038 --> 02:04:04,540
NO.

3060
02:04:04,540 --> 02:04:07,043
ROSS, IT...

3061
02:04:07,543 --> 02:04:09,545
IT JUST SEEMS THAT, YOU KNOW

3062
02:04:09,545 --> 02:04:11,047
IT'S TIME WE, YOU KNOW, MOVE ON.

3063
02:04:11,047 --> 02:04:13,049
I MEAN, DON'T YOU THINK?

3064
02:04:14,050 --> 02:04:15,551
YES.

3065
02:04:15,551 --> 02:04:16,552
YEAH.

3066
02:04:16,552 --> 02:04:17,553
YES, I DO.

3067
02:04:18,054 --> 02:04:19,055
GOOD.

3068
02:04:19,055 --> 02:04:20,556
YEAH, I I REALLY DO.

3069
02:04:20,556 --> 02:04:22,558
HEY!

3070
02:04:22,558 --> 02:04:25,061
THIS... THIS WAS A GIFT.

3071
02:04:25,061 --> 02:04:26,562
ROSS

3072
02:04:26,562 --> 02:04:29,565
YOU GOT THAT FOR FREE FROM THE MUSEUM GIFT SHOP.

3073
02:04:29,565 --> 02:04:32,068
IT'S STILL A GIFT.

3074
02:04:32,068 --> 02:04:34,570
I GOT IF FROM THE GIFT SHOP.

3075
02:04:34,570 --> 02:04:35,571
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

3076
02:04:35,571 --> 02:04:37,073
GIVE ME THE MUG.

3077
02:04:37,073 --> 02:04:38,574
I'LL KEEP THE MUG.

3078
02:04:38,574 --> 02:04:41,077
NO! YOU KNOW, DON'T DO ME ANY FAVORS.

3079
02:04:41,077 --> 02:04:42,578
IN FACT, WHERE...

3080
02:04:42,578 --> 02:04:44,580
WHERE'S THE REST OF MY STUFF?

3081
02:04:44,580 --> 02:04:46,082
LIKE, LIKE...

3082
02:04:46,082 --> 02:04:48,084
MY, UM... HEY!

3083
02:04:48,084 --> 02:04:50,586
THIS BOOK IS MINE!

3084
02:04:50,586 --> 02:04:52,088
AND AND AND

3085
02:04:52,088 --> 02:04:55,591
AND THAT T SHIRT YOU SLEEP IN, I'D LIKE THAT BACK, TOO.

3086
02:04:55,591 --> 02:04:57,093
YES, I DO.

3087
02:04:58,594 --> 02:05:01,097
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE THAT T SHIRT.

3088
02:05:01,097 --> 02:05:03,599
YOU NEVER EVEN WEAR THAT T SHIRT.

3089
02:05:03,599 --> 02:05:06,602
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU MOVE ON.

3090
02:05:06,602 --> 02:05:09,105
OH, YOU ARE A PETTY MAN.

3091
02:05:09,105 --> 02:05:11,107
YOU ARE A PETTY, PETTY...

3092
02:05:11,107 --> 02:05:12,608
PETTY, PETTY...

3093
02:05:12,608 --> 02:05:14,110
PETTY, SMALL...

3094
02:05:14,110 --> 02:05:15,111
SMALL...

3095
02:05:19,115 --> 02:05:21,617
YOU ARE SO JUST DOING THIS OUT OF SPITE.

3096
02:05:21,617 --> 02:05:23,619
UH UH. NO, NO, NO.

3097
02:05:23,619 --> 02:05:25,621
I'M GOING TO WEAR THIS ALL THE TIME.

3098
02:05:25,621 --> 02:05:26,622
I LOVE THIS SHIRT.

3099
02:05:26,622 --> 02:05:29,125
YOU HAVE NOT WORN THAT T SHIRT SINCE YOU WERE 15.

3100
02:05:29,125 --> 02:05:31,127
IT DOESN'T EVEN FIT YOU ANYMORE.

3101
02:05:31,127 --> 02:05:32,628
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

3102
02:05:32,628 --> 02:05:34,130
YEAH, YEAH.

3103
02:05:34,130 --> 02:05:36,632
OH, OKAY, OKAY.

3104
02:05:46,642 --> 02:05:48,144
NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND

3105
02:05:48,644 --> 02:05:51,147
I'M GOING TO TAKE THE REST OF MY STUFF

3106
02:05:51,147 --> 02:05:54,150
AND RELAX

3107
02:05:54,150 --> 02:05:56,652
IN MY FAVORITE SHIRT.

3108
02:05:58,654 --> 02:06:00,156
YOU HAVE A PLEASANT EVENING.

3109
02:06:10,666 --> 02:06:12,668
SO YOU'RE, LIKE, A ZILLIONAIRE.

3110
02:06:14,170 --> 02:06:15,671
AND YOU'RE OUR AGE.

3111
02:06:15,671 --> 02:06:16,672
YOU'RE OURAGE.

3112
02:06:16,672 --> 02:06:18,174
YOU KNOW WHAT?

3113
02:06:18,174 --> 02:06:20,176
YOU SHOULD, LIKE, YOU SHOULD BUY A STATE

3114
02:06:20,176 --> 02:06:22,678
AND THEN JUST NAME IT AFTER YOURSELF.

3115
02:06:22,678 --> 02:06:24,680
LIKE PETE DAKOTA.

3116
02:06:24,680 --> 02:06:26,182

3117
02:06:26,182 --> 02:06:27,683
OR MISSISSIPETE.

3118
02:06:29,685 --> 02:06:30,686
OH, OH, I GOT IT.

3119
02:06:30,686 --> 02:06:33,189
PETE CHICAGO.

3120
02:06:33,689 --> 02:06:36,192
THAT'S NOT A STATE, JOE.

3121
02:06:36,192 --> 02:06:38,194
OH, AND MISSISSIPETE IS?

3122
02:06:40,196 --> 02:06:41,697
I GOT TO GO.

3123
02:06:41,697 --> 02:06:44,200
SO, I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

3124
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:45,201
 OKAY.

3125
02:06:45,201 --> 02:06:46,702
YOU'RE OURAGE.

3126
02:06:48,704 --> 02:06:50,706
SO, WE ON FOR TOMORROW?

3127
02:06:50,706 --> 02:06:51,707
ABSOLUTELY.

3128
02:06:53,709 --> 02:06:55,711
NOW GET OUT OF HERE, YOU.

3129
02:07:02,718 --> 02:07:05,721
OKAY, I'M RUNNING OUT OF PLACES I CAN TOUCH HIM.

3130
02:07:05,721 --> 02:07:08,224
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME?

3131
02:07:08,224 --> 02:07:11,227
WHY AM I ONLY ATTRACTED TO GUYS WHERE THERE'S NO FUTURE?

3132
02:07:11,227 --> 02:07:13,729
EITHER THEY'RE TOO OLD OR THEY'RE TOO YOUNG

3133
02:07:13,729 --> 02:07:16,732
OR THEY'RE A BIG, MISOGYNIST, JERK POET LIKE JULIO--

3134
02:07:16,732 --> 02:07:19,235
WHO, BY THE WAY, I'M STILL ATTRACTED TO--

3135
02:07:19,235 --> 02:07:21,237
AND THEN THERE'S PETE

3136
02:07:21,237 --> 02:07:23,739
WHO'S CRAZY ABOUT ME, AND HE'S ABSOLUTELY PERFECT

3137
02:07:23,739 --> 02:07:25,241
AND THERE'S, LIKE, ZIP GOING ON.

3138
02:07:25,241 --> 02:07:28,244
SERIOUSLY, DOES IT SOUND LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME?

3139
02:07:28,244 --> 02:07:29,745
YEAH. KIND OF.

3140
02:07:32,748 --> 02:07:35,251
HAPPY? IS THAT WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE, VIC?

3141
02:07:35,251 --> 02:07:36,752
HAPPY?

3142
02:07:36,752 --> 02:07:39,755
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE, HUH?

3143
02:07:39,755 --> 02:07:42,258
BECAUSE I SURE AS HELL CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.

3144
02:07:42,258 --> 02:07:44,260
I TALK TO YOU AND NOTHING.

3145
02:07:44,260 --> 02:07:46,762
YOU LOOK AT ME AND IT'S NOTHING.

3146
02:07:50,766 --> 02:07:52,268
NOTHING.

3147
02:07:52,268 --> 02:07:55,771
MMM, TASTY.

3148
02:07:57,273 --> 02:08:00,776
I'M REALLY STARTING TO FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS HAVE A HISTORY.

3149
02:08:00,776 --> 02:08:01,777
IT'S NICE.

3150
02:08:01,777 --> 02:08:03,779
I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THIS SCENE.

3151
02:08:03,779 --> 02:08:05,281
YES.

3152
02:08:05,281 --> 02:08:06,782
WELL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND

3153
02:08:06,782 --> 02:08:08,784
WHY ADRIENNE'S ATTRACTED TO VICTOR.

3154
02:08:08,784 --> 02:08:10,786
PEEL THE ONION.

3155
02:08:10,786 --> 02:08:13,789
FIRST OF ALL, HE'S GOOD LOOKING.

3156
02:08:13,789 --> 02:08:15,291
YEAH.

3157
02:08:15,291 --> 02:08:17,293
I THINK MY CHARACTER'S GOING TO NEED

3158
02:08:17,293 --> 02:08:19,295
A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A REASON THAN THAT.

3159
02:08:19,295 --> 02:08:20,796
HEY, HOW ABOUT THIS ONE--

3160
02:08:20,796 --> 02:08:22,298
UH, IT SAYS SO IN THE SCRIPT!

3161
02:08:24,300 --> 02:08:25,801
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW

3162
02:08:25,801 --> 02:08:27,803
WHY MY CHARACTER LIKES YOU EITHER.

3163
02:08:27,803 --> 02:08:29,805
I MEAN, IT SAYS IN THE SCRIPT HERE

3164
02:08:29,805 --> 02:08:31,307
THAT YOU'RE A BITCH.

3165
02:08:31,307 --> 02:08:32,808
IT DOESN'T SAY THAT IN THE SCRIPT.

3166
02:08:32,808 --> 02:08:34,810
IT DOES IN MINE.

3167
02:08:37,313 --> 02:08:39,315
 I CAN BLOW DRY IT.

3168
02:08:39,315 --> 02:08:40,316
I CAN PUT GEL ON IT.

3169
02:08:40,816 --> 02:08:41,817
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

3170
02:08:41,817 --> 02:08:44,320
I STILL WIND UP WITH THIS LITTLE COWLICKY THING

3171
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:45,821
ON THE MIDDLE PART OF MY HEAD.

3172
02:08:45,821 --> 02:08:47,323
IT'S SO ANNOYING.

3173
02:08:47,323 --> 02:08:48,824
DOES IT BUG YOU?

3174
02:08:48,824 --> 02:08:50,326
YOU BUG ME.

3175
02:09:02,838 --> 02:09:05,841
IS THERE ANY CHANCE YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT?

3176
02:09:10,846 --> 02:09:13,849
ROSS, YOU GOT TO STOP, OKAY?

3177
02:09:13,849 --> 02:09:16,852
YOU CAN'T JUST STARE THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE

3178
02:09:16,852 --> 02:09:18,354
FOR THREE HOURS.

3179
02:09:19,355 --> 02:09:21,857
YOU'RE GOING TO GET PEEP EYE.

3180
02:09:21,857 --> 02:09:23,359
I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT.

3181
02:09:23,359 --> 02:09:24,860
I ALWAYS KNEW SHE LIKED HIM.

3182
02:09:25,361 --> 02:09:27,363
SHE'D SAY NO, BUT HERE WE ARE, RIGHT?

3183
02:09:27,363 --> 02:09:29,865
WE JUST BROKE UP, FIRST THING SHE DOES...

3184
02:09:29,865 --> 02:09:31,867
YOU DIDN'T JUST BREAK UP.

3185
02:09:31,867 --> 02:09:33,869
HEY, IT'S BEEN, LIKE, THREE WEEKS.

3186
02:09:33,869 --> 02:09:35,371
YOU SLEPT WITH SOMEBODY

3187
02:09:35,371 --> 02:09:38,374
THREE HOURS AFTER YOU THOUGHT YOU BROKE UP.

3188
02:09:38,374 --> 02:09:40,876
I MEAN, BULLETS HAVE LEFT GUNS SLOWER.

3189
02:09:40,876 --> 02:09:43,379
HERE THEY COME. HERE THEY...

3190
02:09:43,379 --> 02:09:44,880
OH, IF SHE KISSES HIM GOOD NIGHT

3191
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:46,882
I'M GOING TO KILL MYSELF, I SWEAR.

3192
02:09:46,882 --> 02:09:49,385
I CAN'T... I CAN'T WATCH...

3193
02:09:49,385 --> 02:09:50,886
COME ON. DATE OVER.

3194
02:09:50,886 --> 02:09:51,887
DATE OVER.

3195
02:09:51,887 --> 02:09:53,389
OH, OH. HERE WE GO.

3196
02:09:53,389 --> 02:09:54,390
SHE'S GOING IN.

3197
02:09:54,390 --> 02:09:55,391
OKAY.

3198
02:09:55,391 --> 02:09:57,393
SHE'S GOING IN.

3199
02:09:57,393 --> 02:09:58,394
HE'S GOING IN.

3200
02:10:00,396 --> 02:10:01,397
HE'S GOING IN.

3201
02:10:01,397 --> 02:10:03,399
THE DOOR'S CLOSED.

3202
02:10:03,399 --> 02:10:05,901
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING WITH THE DOOR CLOSED.

3203
02:10:05,901 --> 02:10:09,405
AND THE INVENTOR OF THE DOOR RESTS HAPPILY IN HIS GRAVE.

3204
02:10:09,405 --> 02:10:10,906
OKAY. I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

3205
02:10:10,906 --> 02:10:12,908
I MEAN, I HAVE TO STOP IT.

3206
02:10:12,908 --> 02:10:14,410
STOP WHAT? I DON'T KNOW.

3207
02:10:14,410 --> 02:10:16,912
BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT MY BEING THERE WILL DO IT.

3208
02:10:16,912 --> 02:10:18,914
LOOK, THIS GUY

3209
02:10:18,914 --> 02:10:20,416
IS BAD NEWS, CHANDLER.

3210
02:10:20,416 --> 02:10:22,418
HE'S... I CAN SEE HE'S AN OPERATOR.

3211
02:10:22,418 --> 02:10:23,919
RACHEL WOULDN'T DATE AN OPERATOR.

3212
02:10:23,919 --> 02:10:24,920
THEY ONLY MAKE 20 GRAND A YEAR

3213
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:26,422
AND THEY HAVE TO WORK NIGHTS.

3214
02:10:29,425 --> 02:10:32,428
I'LL GO OVER, AND I WILL BORROW SOMETHING.

3215
02:10:32,428 --> 02:10:34,430
JUICE. I NEED JUICE.

3216
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:35,931
NO, YOU CAN'T!

3217
02:10:35,931 --> 02:10:37,933
LOOK, THEY MUST BE STOPPED!

3218
02:10:37,933 --> 02:10:38,934
I AM YOUR FRIEND

3219
02:10:39,435 --> 02:10:41,437
AND I AM NOT GOING TO LET YOU DO THIS!

3220
02:10:41,437 --> 02:10:44,440
YOU ARE SURPRISINGLY STRONG!

3221
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:45,941
I NEED JUICE.

3222
02:10:45,941 --> 02:10:46,942
PEOPLE NEED JUICE!

3223
02:10:46,942 --> 02:10:47,943
LOOK, MAN...

3224
02:10:48,444 --> 02:10:49,445
PEOPLE NEED JUICE!

3225
02:10:49,445 --> 02:10:50,446
LISTEN TO ME.

3226
02:10:50,446 --> 02:10:51,947
JUICE! THEY NEED JUICE!

3227
02:10:54,450 --> 02:10:56,452
SHE'S MOVING ON, OKAY?

3228
02:10:56,452 --> 02:10:59,455
IF IT'S NOT THIS GUY, IT'S GOING TO BE SOMEBODY ELSE.

3229
02:10:59,455 --> 02:11:01,957
UNLESS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT SUBLETTING MY PEEPHOLE

3230
02:11:01,957 --> 02:11:04,460
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GET USED TO THE FACT

3231
02:11:04,460 --> 02:11:05,961
THAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS OVER.

3232
02:11:05,961 --> 02:11:07,463
OKAY, MAN?

3233
02:11:07,463 --> 02:11:08,964
IT'S OVER.

3234
02:11:11,967 --> 02:11:13,469
YEAH. OKAY.

3235
02:11:13,469 --> 02:11:15,471
OKAY.

3236
02:11:15,471 --> 02:11:17,473
IT'S JUST I MISS HER SO MUCH.

3237
02:11:18,974 --> 02:11:20,476
I KNOW.

3238
02:11:25,981 --> 02:11:29,985
IS IT JUST ME, OR DID "SUBLETTING MY PEEPHOLE"

3239
02:11:29,985 --> 02:11:31,987
SOUND KIND OF DIRTY?

3240
02:11:34,490 --> 02:11:37,493
WHY DO ALL YOUR COFFEE MUGS HAVE NUMBERS ON THE BOTTOM?

3241
02:11:37,493 --> 02:11:39,495
OH, THAT'S SO MONICA CAN KEEP TRACK.

3242
02:11:39,495 --> 02:11:41,497
THAT WAY, IF ONE OF THEM'S MISSING

3243
02:11:41,497 --> 02:11:43,499
SHE CAN BE, LIKE, "WHERE'S NUMBER 27?"

3244
02:11:43,499 --> 02:11:45,000

3245
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:46,502

3246
02:11:52,007 --> 02:11:53,509
YOU KNOW WHAT?

3247
02:11:53,509 --> 02:11:56,512
NO, AND I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO WANT TO.

3248
02:11:56,512 --> 02:11:58,514
I CAN'T DO THIS.

3249
02:11:58,514 --> 02:12:01,016
YEP, YEP. THAT'S WHAT I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW.

3250
02:12:01,016 --> 02:12:03,018
YEAH. OH, MARK, I'M JUST DOING THIS

3251
02:12:03,018 --> 02:12:05,020
FOR THE WRONG REASONS, YOU KNOW?

3252
02:12:05,020 --> 02:12:07,523
I'M JUST DOING IT TO GET BACK AT ROSS.

3253
02:12:07,523 --> 02:12:09,024
I'M SORRY.

3254
02:12:09,024 --> 02:12:10,526
IT'S NOT VERY FAIR TO YOU.

3255
02:12:12,027 --> 02:12:14,029
AH, FAIR SHMAIR, YOU KNOW?

3256
02:12:14,029 --> 02:12:16,532
LOOK, YOU WANT TO GET BACK AT ROSS

3257
02:12:16,532 --> 02:12:18,534
I AM HERE FOR YOU.

3258
02:12:18,534 --> 02:12:21,036
REALLY.

3259
02:12:21,036 --> 02:12:22,037
NO, NO.

3260
02:12:22,037 --> 02:12:25,040
I SAY WE GET BACK AT HIM RIGHT HERE ON THIS COUCH.

3261
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:26,041
RIGHT HERE.

3262
02:12:26,041 --> 02:12:29,044
OH, GOD.

3263
02:12:29,545 --> 02:12:33,048
I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS.

3264
02:12:33,048 --> 02:12:35,050
THAT'S OKAY.

3265
02:12:37,052 --> 02:12:38,554
YOU SURE?

3266
02:12:38,554 --> 02:12:40,055
YEAH.

3267
02:12:40,055 --> 02:12:41,557
I CAN JUST GO HOME

3268
02:12:41,557 --> 02:12:43,559
AND GET BACK AT HIM BY MYSELF.

3269
02:12:47,563 --> 02:12:51,567
 ...POISED TO BECOME THE PENICILLIN OF THE 21st CENTURY.

3270
02:12:51,567 --> 02:12:55,070
AND SO, TODAY, THIS HOSPITAL IS ABOUT TO TAKE MAJOR STEPS

3271
02:12:55,070 --> 02:12:57,072
TOWARD LEADING THAT REVOLUTION.

3272
02:12:57,072 --> 02:12:58,574
IT IS TRULY IRONIC...

3273
02:12:58,574 --> 02:12:59,575
HEY.

3274
02:12:59,575 --> 02:13:01,076
COULD I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

3275
02:13:01,076 --> 02:13:03,579
...ON THE ONE HAND, TO CONSIDER THE SIZE

3276
02:13:03,579 --> 02:13:05,080
OF THE HUMAN GENE...

3277
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:06,582
WHERE ARE WE?

3278
02:13:06,582 --> 02:13:10,586
WELL, WITH ALL THESE DOCTORS AND NURSES

3279
02:13:11,086 --> 02:13:13,088
I'M GOING TO SAY MIDGET RODEO.

3280
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:15,591
JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH.

3281
02:13:15,591 --> 02:13:17,593
OKAY.

3282
02:13:19,094 --> 02:13:20,596
UM...

3283
02:13:20,596 --> 02:13:23,098
YOU KNOW, I I DON'T THINK I TOLD YOU THIS

3284
02:13:23,098 --> 02:13:25,100
BUT I JUST RECENTLY GOT OUT

3285
02:13:25,100 --> 02:13:28,103
OF A REALLY SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP.

3286
02:13:28,604 --> 02:13:30,105
WASN'T THAT, LIKE, A YEAR AGO?

3287
02:13:31,607 --> 02:13:33,108
SO I DID TELL YOU.

3288
02:13:33,609 --> 02:13:36,111
OKAY. WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT REALLY THE THING.

3289
02:13:36,111 --> 02:13:37,613
THE THING IS, IS THAT RIGHT NOW

3290
02:13:38,113 --> 02:13:39,615
I'M JUST IN A PLACE IN MY LIFE

3291
02:13:39,615 --> 02:13:41,617
WHERE I JUST NEED TO FOCUS ON ME.

3292
02:13:41,617 --> 02:13:43,118
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

3293
02:13:43,118 --> 02:13:44,119
OH, YEAH. I KNOW.

3294
02:13:45,621 --> 02:13:48,123
I SO WANT TO BE ATTRACTED TO YOU...

3295
02:13:48,123 --> 02:13:49,625
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

3296
02:13:49,625 --> 02:13:50,626
OKAY. GOOD.

3297
02:13:50,626 --> 02:13:52,127
I'M SORRY.

3298
02:13:54,129 --> 02:13:55,631
YOU KNOW WHAT?

3299
02:13:55,631 --> 02:13:56,632
DON'T BE.

3300
02:13:56,632 --> 02:13:57,633
THIS IS NOT...

3301
02:13:58,133 --> 02:13:59,635
DON'T BE, BECAUSE IT'S NOT SO BAD.

3302
02:14:00,135 --> 02:14:01,637
IT'S NOT?

3303
02:14:01,637 --> 02:14:04,139
I KNOW I'M NO JON BON JOVI...

3304
02:14:06,141 --> 02:14:09,645
OR SOMEONE YOU FIND ATTRACTIVE.

3305
02:14:09,645 --> 02:14:11,647
I'M JUST... I JUST THINK, YOU KNOW

3306
02:14:11,647 --> 02:14:16,151
THAT YOU MIGHT END UP FEELING DIFFERENTLY.

3307
02:14:16,151 --> 02:14:18,153
HOW CAN ANY OF US FORGET JEFFREY ASTROFT?

3308
02:14:18,153 --> 02:14:21,156
WELL, LOOK, I DON'T WANT THIS TO COME OUT WRONG

3309
02:14:21,156 --> 02:14:24,159
BUT, UH, YOU SEEM AWFULLY CONFIDENT

3310
02:14:24,159 --> 02:14:26,662
FOR A GUY I JUST TOLD I WASN'T ATTRACTED TO.

3311
02:14:26,662 --> 02:14:29,665
YEAH. STUPIDLY CHARMING, ISN'T IT?

3312
02:14:29,665 --> 02:14:31,166
AH, LISTEN, LET'S...

3313
02:14:31,166 --> 02:14:33,168
YOU WANT TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT?

3314
02:14:33,168 --> 02:14:35,671
BECAUSE THIS PLACE IS KIND OF DEE PRESSING.

3315
02:14:35,671 --> 02:14:39,174
AND NOW THE MAN WHO MADE ALL THIS POSSIBLE...

3316
02:14:39,174 --> 02:14:41,677
MR. PETER BECKER.

3317
02:14:41,677 --> 02:14:43,178
ONE SEC.

3318
02:14:50,686 --> 02:14:53,188
I DON'T THINK THIS TOWN IS BIG ENOUGH

3319
02:14:53,188 --> 02:14:55,691
FOR THE BOTH OF US TO RELAX IN.

3320
02:14:58,193 --> 02:14:59,695
DRAW!

3321
02:15:03,699 --> 02:15:05,701
I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING.

3322
02:15:11,707 --> 02:15:14,710
UH OH. WHAT DID SHE DO NOW?

3323
02:15:14,710 --> 02:15:17,212
JUST BECAUSE SHE WENT TO YALE DRAMA

3324
02:15:17,212 --> 02:15:20,215
SHE THINKS SHE'S, LIKE, THE GREATEST ACTRESS SINCE...

3325
02:15:20,716 --> 02:15:22,718
SINCE SLICED BREAD.

3326
02:15:22,718 --> 02:15:26,221
AH, SLICED BREAD-- A WONDERFUL LADY MACBETH.

3327
02:15:26,221 --> 02:15:28,223
GOD, I JUST... I HATE HER.

3328
02:15:28,724 --> 02:15:31,226
I HATE HER WITH HER, "OH, I'M SO TALENTED"

3329
02:15:31,226 --> 02:15:34,730
AND, "OOH, I'M SO PRETTY" AND, "OOH, I SMELL SO GOOD."

3330
02:15:35,230 --> 02:15:38,233
I THINK SOMEBODY HAS A CRUSH ON SOMEBODY.

3331
02:15:38,233 --> 02:15:40,736
CHANDLER, CAN WE PLEASE TRY AND STAY FOCUSED

3332
02:15:40,736 --> 02:15:42,738
ON MY PROBLEM HERE, YOU KNOW?

3333
02:15:42,738 --> 02:15:46,241
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU, YOU BIG, BIG FREAK.

3334
02:15:46,241 --> 02:15:48,744
OH.

3335
02:15:48,744 --> 02:15:50,746
OH. OH. YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.

3336
02:15:50,746 --> 02:15:53,248
YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT TALK ABOUT HER.

3337
02:15:53,248 --> 02:15:54,750
FOR THE LAST 48 HOURS.

3338
02:15:54,750 --> 02:15:57,753
IF YOU WERE IN A SCHOOLYARD, YOU'D BE PULLING HER PIGTAILS

3339
02:15:57,753 --> 02:16:00,255
AND PUSHING HER DOWN NOW.

3340
02:16:00,255 --> 02:16:01,256
OH, YEAH?

3341
02:16:01,256 --> 02:16:03,258
THEN HOW COME I KEEP THINKING ABOUT HER

3342
02:16:03,258 --> 02:16:05,761
IN ALL THESE SEXUAL SCENARIOS AND STUFF, HUH?

3343
02:16:11,767 --> 02:16:12,768
HAPPY?

3344
02:16:12,768 --> 02:16:15,771
IS THAT WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE, VIC? HAPPY?

3345
02:16:15,771 --> 02:16:17,272
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME

3346
02:16:17,272 --> 02:16:19,274
WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE, HUH?

3347
02:16:19,274 --> 02:16:21,276
BECAUSE I SURE AS HELL CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.

3348
02:16:21,777 --> 02:16:23,779
I TALK TO YOU, AND IT'S NOTHING.

3349
02:16:23,779 --> 02:16:26,782
YOU LOOK AT ME, AND NOTHING.

3350
02:16:40,295 --> 02:16:41,797
NOTHING.

3351
02:16:43,799 --> 02:16:47,302
YOU GUYS MAKE ME FLY...

3352
02:16:49,805 --> 02:16:51,306
HIGH.

3353
02:16:51,306 --> 02:16:52,808
OKAY.

3354
02:16:52,808 --> 02:16:55,310
WE'RE GOING TO PICK IT UP HERE TOMORROW.

3355
02:16:57,312 --> 02:16:58,814
WELL, THAT WAS, UH...

3356
02:16:58,814 --> 02:16:59,815
BETTER?

3357
02:17:00,315 --> 02:17:01,316
YEAH, YEAH.

3358
02:17:01,316 --> 02:17:05,320
IT WAS DEFINITELY AN IMPROVEMENT, UH...

3359
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:06,321
GOOD NIGHT.

3360
02:17:06,321 --> 02:17:07,322
UH, KATE.

3361
02:17:07,322 --> 02:17:08,824
YEAH.

3362
02:17:08,824 --> 02:17:12,327
YOU, UH... YOU FORGOT YOUR SHOES.

3363
02:17:12,327 --> 02:17:13,829

3364
02:17:13,829 --> 02:17:17,332
I'M PROBABLY GOING TO NEED THOSE, HUH?

3365
02:17:17,332 --> 02:17:18,834

3366
02:17:21,837 --> 02:17:23,839
HEY, LISTEN. YOU, UH...

3367
02:17:23,839 --> 02:17:26,341
FEEL LIKE GETTING A CUP OF COFFEE?

3368
02:17:27,342 --> 02:17:28,343
KATE.

3369
02:17:28,343 --> 02:17:29,344
YEAH.

3370
02:17:29,344 --> 02:17:30,345
YOU READY TO GO?

3371
02:17:30,846 --> 02:17:31,847
YEAH.

3372
02:17:32,848 --> 02:17:34,850
VERY NICE. VERY NICE.

3373
02:17:37,853 --> 02:17:39,354
SO, UH...

3374
02:17:39,354 --> 02:17:41,356
SEE YOU TOMORROW, HUH?

3375
02:17:41,356 --> 02:17:42,858
YEAH, YEAH. SURE.

3376
02:17:42,858 --> 02:17:44,359
RIGHT. GOOD NIGHT.

3377
02:17:53,869 --> 02:17:54,870
HEY.

3378
02:17:57,372 --> 02:17:58,874
WHY ISN'T IT SPIDERMAN?

3379
02:17:58,874 --> 02:18:01,877
YOU KNOW, LIKE GOLDMAN, SILVERMAN?

3380
02:18:01,877 --> 02:18:05,380
BECAUSE IT'S... IT'S NOT HIS LAST NAME.

3381
02:18:05,380 --> 02:18:06,381
IT ISN'T?

3382
02:18:06,882 --> 02:18:10,385
NO. IT'S NOT, LIKE... LIKE, PHIL SPIDERMAN.

3383
02:18:13,388 --> 02:18:15,891
HE'S A SPIDER...MAN.

3384
02:18:16,892 --> 02:18:20,395
YOU KNOW, LIKE, UH, LIKE GOLDMAN IS A LAST NAME

3385
02:18:20,896 --> 02:18:23,398
BUT THERE'S NO GOLD MAN.

3386
02:18:23,398 --> 02:18:24,900
OH. OH, OKAY.

3387
02:18:24,900 --> 02:18:27,903
THERE SHOULD BE A GOLD MAN.

3388
02:18:29,905 --> 02:18:30,906
HEY.

3389
02:18:30,906 --> 02:18:31,907
 HEY, RACH.

3390
02:18:31,907 --> 02:18:33,909
HOW WAS WORK?

3391
02:18:33,909 --> 02:18:36,912
GREAT, ALTHOUGH I DID SIT DOWN WHERE THERE WASN'T A CHAIR.

3392
02:18:36,912 --> 02:18:39,915
BY THE WAY, ROSS DROPPED BY A BOX OF YOUR STUFF.

3393
02:18:40,415 --> 02:18:42,918
OH. WELL, I GUESS I HAD THAT ONE COMING.

3394
02:18:42,918 --> 02:18:44,920
I'M JUST GOING TO THROW IT OUT.

3395
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:47,422
IT'S PROBABLY JUST A BUNCH OF SHAMPOO AND...

3396
02:18:48,423 --> 02:18:50,425
SOMETHING WRONG?

3397
02:18:59,434 --> 02:19:01,436
NO, NOTHING.

3398
02:19:08,944 --> 02:19:11,446
SO WHAT KIND OF POWERS WOULD GOLD MAN HAVE?

3399
02:19:11,446 --> 02:19:15,951
OKAY. WELL, HE WOULD TURN THINGS TO GOLD.

3400
02:19:15,951 --> 02:19:18,453
WHAT ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY GOLD?

3401
02:19:18,453 --> 02:19:20,455
AH, HIS WORK IS DONE.

3402
02:19:20,455 --> 02:19:21,957
OKAY, I HAVE A FRIEND--

3403
02:19:21,957 --> 02:19:25,460
JIMMY TUPPERMAN-- WHAT WOULD HIS POWERS BE?

3404
02:19:25,460 --> 02:19:28,463
TUPPER MAN.

3405
02:19:28,463 --> 02:19:31,466
HE WOULD KEEP CRIMINALS FRESH UNTIL THE POLICE CAME.

3406
02:19:31,466 --> 02:19:33,969
COOL.

3407
02:19:33,969 --> 02:19:35,470
OKAY, LET'S PLAY MY GAME NOW.

3408
02:19:35,470 --> 02:19:36,972
OKAY.

3409
02:19:36,972 --> 02:19:39,474
OH, YOU YELLOW BELLIED, LILY LIVERED...

3410
02:19:39,474 --> 02:19:40,976
DRAW!

3411
02:19:41,476 --> 02:19:44,980
