1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,004
HEY.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,005
HEY.

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,007
HEY, HEY, HEY.

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,508
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

5
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,010
DID A FOREST TICK YOU OFF?

6
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,013
NO.

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,015
YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE ALWAYS SAYING

8
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,516
WE NEED A PLACE FOR THE MAIL.

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,021
YEAH?

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,523
WELL, I STARTED BUILDING ONE.

11
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,526
BUT THEN I DECIDED TO TAKE IT TO THE NEXT STEP.

12
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,529
YOU'RE BUILDING A POST OFFICE?

13
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,532
NO, AN ENTERTAINMENT UNIT

14
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,534
WITH A MAIL CUBBY BUILT RIGHT IN.

15
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,536
IT'S A ONE DAY JOB, MAX.

16
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,038
OKAY.

17
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,541
MY WORD, THOSE ARE SNUG.

18
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,044
OH, YEAH.

19
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,046
THESE ARE MY OLD WORK PANTS.

20
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,048
SERGIO VALENTE.

21
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,559
POWER SAW KIND OF GOT AWAY FROM ME THERE.

35
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,112
HEY, PHEEBS.

36
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,113
HEY.

37
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,114
ANY SIGN OF YOUR BROTHER?

38
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,615
NO, BUT HE'S ALWAYS LATE.

39
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,117
I THOUGHT YOU ONLY MET HIM ONCE.

40
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,618
YEAH, I DID.

41
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,122
I THINK IT SOUNDS, LIKE, BIG SISTER Y.

42
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,623
YOU KNOW, "FRANK'S ALWAYS LATE."

43
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,126
WELL, RELAX, HE'LL BE HERE.

44
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,628
YEAH. OH, I KNOW. I'M JUST NERVOUS.

45
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,130
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST...

46
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,132
MOM'S DEAD, DON'T TALK TO MY SISTER...

47
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,134
GRANDMA'S BEEN SLEEPING A LOT LATELY.

48
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,138
IT'S JUST, LIKE, THE LAST DESPERATE CHANCE

49
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,140
TO HAVE A FAMILY KIND OF THING.

50
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,641
YOU'RE SO SWEET TO WAIT WITH ME.

51
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,643
WELL, ACTUALLY, GUNTHER SENT ME.

52
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,644
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED

53
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,146
TO HAVE CUPS OUT HERE.

54
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,147
MMM.

55
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,649
DOES ANYONE ELSE THINK

56
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,651
DAVID COPPERFIELD'S CUTE?

57
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,154
NO...

58
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,656
BUT HE TOLD ME HE THINKS YOU'RE A FOX.

59
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,160
ALL RIGHT, JANICE LIKES HIM.

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,163
IN FACT, SHE LIKES HIM SO MUCH SHE PUT HIM ON HER, UH...

61
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,664
FREEBIE LIST.

62
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,167
HER WHAT?

63
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,169
WELL, WE HAVE A DEAL WHERE WE EACH GET

64
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,671
TO PICK FIVE DIFFERENT CELEBRITIES

65
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,173
THAT WE CAN SLEEP WITH...

66
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,175
AND THE OTHER ONE CAN'T GET MAD.

67
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:59,179
AH, THE HEART OF EVERY HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP...

68
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,682
HONESTY, RESPECT AND SEX WITH CELEBRITIES.

69
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,684
SO, CHANDLER, WHO'S ON YOUR LIST?

70
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,186
AH, KIM BASINGER...

71
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,688
UH, CINDY CRAWFORD, HALLE BERRY...

72
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:09,689
YASMINE BLEETH.

73
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,691
OH, BOY.

74
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,693
AND, UH, JESSICA RABBIT.

75
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,198
NOW, YOU DO REALIZE THAT SHE'S A CARTOON

76
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,699
AND WAY OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE?

77
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,201
YEAH, I KNOW. I KNOW.

78
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,204
I JUST ALWAYS WONDERED IF I COULD GET HER EYES

79
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,205
TO POP OUT OF HER HEAD.

80
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,707
MAN, THIS IS SUCH A GREAT THING.

81
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,710
ANNIE ESPOSITO WOULD NEVER HAVE DUMPED ME

82
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,712
HAD WE HAD A LIST LIKE THAT.

83
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,715
US. AND ALSO, OF COURSE, IF HER SISTER WAS FAMO

84
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,218
HEY, MONICA, WHO WOULD YOURS BE?

85
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,721
FIRST, I NEED A BOYFRIEND, THEN I CAN HAVE A LIST.

86
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,723
JUST A GAME, MON.

87
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,727
RACH, HOW ABOUT YOU?

88
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,729
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

89
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,730
I GUESS...

90
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,732
CHRIS O'DONNELL, JOHN F. KENNEDY JR.

91
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,235
DANIEL DAY LEWIS, STING AND PARKER STEVENSON.

92
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,239
SPIDER MAN?

93
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,741
HARDY BOY.

94
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,742
PETER PARKER.

95
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,744
THANK YOU.

96
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,747
WHAT ABOUT YOU, HONEY? WHO'D BE ON YOUR LIST?

97
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,748
I... I DON'T KNOW.

98
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,749
THAT KIND OF THING

99
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,751
REQUIRES SOME SERIOUS THOUGHT.

100
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:15,255
FIRST, I'LL DIVIDE MY PROSPECTIVE CANDIDATES INTO CATEGORIES.

101
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,257
WHAT A GEEK.

102
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,260
EVERYBODY, THIS IS FRANK.

103
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,761
THIS IS MY HALF BROTHER FRANK.

104
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,763
THIS IS EVERYBODY. THIS IS ROSS.

105
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,764
HI. HOW ARE YOU?

106
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,765
HEY.

107
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,766
CHANDLER.

108
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,268
HI, HI. HI.

109
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,269
JOEY.

110
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,770
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY...

111
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,771

112
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,274

113
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,275
AND THIS IS RACHEL.

114
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,276
HEY.

115
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,277
W WHOA...

116
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,781
I'M GOING TO GET COFFEE.

117
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,783
HEY, HOW DO YOU GUYS GET ANYTHING DONE?

118
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,784

119
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,786
WE DON'T REALLY.

120
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,790
WELL, SO, NOW, DO YOU GUYS HAVE A LOT OF BIG PLANS?

121
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,792
OH, YEAH. WE'RE GOING TO, LIKE, CONNECT

122
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,294
AND BOND AND EVERYTHING.

123
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,796
YEAH, I WAS THINKING MAYBE WE COULD GO DOWN

124
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,299
TO TIMES SQUARE AND PICK UP SOME NINJA STARS.

125
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,800
OH, AND MY FRIEND, LARRY

126
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,303
HE WANTS ME TO TAKE A PICTURE OF A HOOKER.

127
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,806
YOU KNOW, WE REALLY DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE

128
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,308
OF LIVING IN THE CITY.

129
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,823
OH, SORRY. DID I GET YOU?

130
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,327
NO, YOU DIDN'T "GET ME".

131
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,828
IT'S AN ELECTRIC DRILL.

132
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,830
YOU "GET ME," YOU KILL ME!

133
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,831
CALM DOWN.

134
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,833
DO YOU WANT THIS UNIT OR NOT?

135
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,835
I DO NOT WANT THIS UNIT.

136
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,337
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE

137
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,838
TOLD ME THAT BEFORE.

138
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,839
I'M NOT A MIND READER.

139
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,342
OOH... AND WE'RE OUT OF BEER.

140
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,344
OKAY, I'M GOING TO MONICA'S.

141
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,846
FINE!

142
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,853
 HEY.

143
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,856
WHERE YOU HEADING IN THOSE PANTS, 1982?

144
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,857
OH, MONICA, LISTEN.

145
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,859
I SAW DOWN AT THE HARDWARE STORE

146
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,362
THEY GOT THOSE DESIGNER TILES ON SALE

147
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,365
IF YOU EVER WANT TO REDO YOUR BATHROOM FLOOR.

148
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,367
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY BATHROOM FLOOR?

149
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,868
NOTHING. IT'S JUST...

150
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,870
OLD AND DINGY, THAT'S ALL.

151
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,373
I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT.

152
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,874
OH, YEAH?

153
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,376
IF YOU, UH...

154
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,877
MOVE YOUR HAMPER

155
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,380
YOU CAN SEE THE COLOR THE TILE USED TO BE.

156
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,381

157
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,882
YEAH.

158
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,883
I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS.

159
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,386
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

160
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,388
RELAX, RELAX. HERE, HOLD THIS.

161
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,390
THIS OLD STUFF COMES RIGHT UP.

162
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,391
I'LL SHOW YOU.

163
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,895
A LITTLE MORE THAN I WANTED TO SEE.

164
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,898
OH.

165
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,899
LOOK AT THAT.

166
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,901
EVERY INCH OF THIS IS GLUED DOWN.

167
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,403
IT'D TAKE FOREVER TO PRY THIS UP.

168
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,905
YOU SHOULD, UH... YOU SHOULD JUST LEAVE IT.

169
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,407

170
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,409
I CAN'T LEAVE IT.

171
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,911
YOU GOUGED A HOLE IN MY DINGY FLOOR.

172
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,913
UH...

173
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,422
YEAH, THERE YOU GO.

174
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,423
AW...

175
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,425
YEAH, THAT'S NICE.

176
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,926
WE CAN PUT IT BACK THERE

177
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,429
AFTER THE SURGEONS REMOVE IT FROM YOUR COLON.

178
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,431
GIVE ME A NEW FLOOR.

179
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,932
I CAN'T, MONICA.

180
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,933
CHANDLER WILL KILL ME

181
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,435
IF I DON'T FINISH THE UNIT.

182
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,437
I'LL PAY YOU DOUBLE WHAT HE'S PAYING YOU.

183
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,938
HE'S NOT PAYING ME ANYTHING.

184
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,440
TRIPLE.

185
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,452
WHAT? OOH! OOH!

186
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,954
YEAH, I KNOW WHAT I WANTED TO ASK YOU.

187
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,956
UM, CAN YOU ROLL YOUR TONGUE?

188
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,958
BECAUSE...

189
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,460
BECAUSE I CAN, AND MY MOM COULDN'T

190
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,961
AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW

191
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,964
I FIGURED THAT WAS SOMETHING I GOT FROM OUR DAD.

192
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,467
WELL, WAIT, YOU MEAN LIKE THIS?

193
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,468
YEAH.

194
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,969
YEAH, YOU CAN DO IT, TOO. YEAH.

195
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,971

196
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,972
YOU'RE NOT DOING IT.

197
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,474
OH, RIGHT. OKAY, YEAH.

198
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,476
MY MOM COULD AND I CAN'T.

199
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,979
WE DON'T HAVE THAT.

200
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,986
WHEN'S YOUR BIRTHDAY?

00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,988
FEBRUARY 16.

202
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,491
I KNOW A GUY WHO'S THE 18th.

203
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,494
THAT'S CLOSE.

204
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,497
WHEN'S YOURS?

205
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,999
OCTOBER 25.

206
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,505
THAT'S THE SAME MONTH AS HALLOWEEN.

207
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,006
YEAH.

208
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,508
YEAH.

209
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,013
SO, UM, WHAT KIND OF THINGS DO YOU LIKE TO DO AT HOME?

210
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,516
MELT STUFF.

211
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,522
OKAY, I'VE GOT THREE OF MY FIVE.

212
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,524
THREE OF YOUR FIVE WHAT?

213
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,527
CELEBRITIES I'M ALLOWED TO SLEEP WITH.

214
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,029
OH, MY GOD,YOU ARE GIVING THIS A LOT OF THOUGHT.

215
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,531
HEY, IT'S HARD, OKAY?

216
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,032
I ONLY HAVE TWO SPOTS LEFT.

217
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,534
ALL RIGHT, WHO YOU GOT IT NARROWED DOWN TO?

218
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,537

221
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,542
FORGIVING.

222
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,545
SUSAN SARANDON.

223
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,548
YOU KNOW WHAT? SHE'S TOO POLITICAL.

224
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,550
SHE PROBABLY WOULDN'T LET YOU DO IT

225
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,052
UNLESS YOU DONATED FOUR CANS OF FOOD FIRST.

226
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,054

227
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,056
AND ISABELLA ROSSELLINI.

228
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,559
OOH... VERY HOT, VERY SEXY.

229
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,562
BUT, UH... YOU KNOW, SHE'S TOO INTERNATIONAL.

230
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,564
YOU KNOW, SHE'S NEVER GOING TO BE AROUND.

231
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,566
SO?

232
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,567
YOU GOT TO PLAY THE ODDS.

233
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,068
PICK SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING

234
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,070
TO BE IN THE COUNTRY, LIKE, ALL THE TIME.

235
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,073
YEAH, BECAUSE THAT'S WHY YOU WON'T GET ISABELLA ROSSELLINI--

236
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,074
GEOGRAPHY.

237
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:50,089
OKAY, SO, BY "MELTING" YOU MEANT MELTING.

238
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,591
YEAH.

239
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,092
SO, IS IT, LIKE, ART?

240
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,094
YEAH, YOU CAN MELT ART.

241
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,097
HEY, CAN I USE YOUR PHONE?

242
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,600
MMM. YEAH, SURE.

243
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,101
WHY, YOU WANT TO CALL YOUR MOM?

244
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,103
NO, I WANT TO MELT IT.

245
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,106
OH, JUST THE NUMBERS.

246
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,608
IT'LL STILL WORK.

247
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,111
OH, WELL, UM, NOT RIGHT NOW.

248
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,114

249
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,116
YOU KNOW WHAT?

250
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,619
I THINK I'M JUST GOING TO GO TO BED.

251
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,121
I THINK THE FUMES ARE GIVING ME A HEADACHE.

252
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,124
YEAH, YEAH...

253
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,128

HERE.

256
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,138
JUST IN CASE.

257
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,140
OH, EXCELLENT.

258
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,648

259
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,155
WHAT KIND OF KARATE IS THAT?

260
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,657
NO KIND.

261
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,660
HE JUST MAKES IT UP.

262
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,661
OH.

263
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,162
SO, HOW'S IT GOING WITH YOU GUYS?

264
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,665
SO FAR, IT KIND OF BLOWS.

265
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,669
I JUST THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, THAT...

266
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,671
HE'D FEEL MORE LIKE A BROTHER.

267
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,673
YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU AND ROSS.

268
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,675
JUST, LIKE, CLOSE AND CONNECTED AND...

269
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,176
HONEY, WE'RE CLOSE NOW

270
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,680
BUT YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE THE YEARS OF NOOGIES AND WEDGIES

271
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,683
AND FLYING WEDGIES AND ATOMIC WEDGIES AND...

272
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,185
THAT'S WHEN THE WAISTBAND

273
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,687
ACTUALLY GOES OVER YOUR HEAD.

274
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,188
AH.

275
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,690
WE USED TO DRIVE

276
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,192
EACH OTHER CRAZY PLAYING THE SHADOW GAME.

277
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,694
OH, HOW DO YOU PLAY THE SHADOW GAME?

278
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,195
OH, HOW DO YOU PLAY THE SHADOW GAME?

279
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,196
I JUST ASKED YOU.

280
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,698
I JUST ASKED YOU.

281
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,200
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

282
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,702
THAT IS WHAT THE GAME IS.

283
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,704
YOU JUST GAVE UP REALLY QUICKLY.

284
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,707
YOU SEEN JOEY?

285
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,708
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

286
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,209
OH, JUST...

287
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,711

288
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,714

289
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,216
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S MY FAULT, REALLY

290
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:01,721
BECAUSE THE COUCH IS WHERE WE USUALLY KEEP THE VARNISH.

291
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,223
 HEY, SOMEBODY WANT TO HAND ME

292
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,725
ONE OF THOSE TILES?

293
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,228
WHAT'S GOING ON?

294
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,730
HE'S RETILING MY FLOOR.

295
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,731
YO!

296
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,233
SPACKLE BOY.

298
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,736
AH AH! YOU STARTED THIS

299
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,737

300
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,739
HE STARTED MINE FIRST.

301
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,742
BUILD THE UNIT, CINDERELLY. LAY THE TILES, CINDERELLY.

302
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,248
HE WAS HELPING ME FIRST.

303
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,750
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

304
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,251

305
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,753
I'M GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK.

306
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:34,754
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

307
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,255
TAKE A BREAK?

308
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,256
YEAH, I THINK EVEN GOD RESTED

309
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,758
ON THE SEVENTH DAY.

310
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,760
JOEY, IF THIS TAKES SEVEN DAYS

311
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,261
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO MEET GOD

312
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,263
AND ASK HIM ABOUT IT YOURSELF.

313
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,271
 WHOA.

314
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,773
BIG OCTOPUS.

315
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,276
YEAH.

316
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,280

317
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,782
HELLO.

318
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,284
OH, MY GOD, I TOTALLY FORGOT.

319
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,787
WELL, CAN'T SOMEONE ELSE DO IT?

320
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,288
BUT I HAVE COMPANY.

321
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,293
YEAH, NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

322
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,795
I'LL COME IN.

323
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,796
OKAY.

324
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,299
FRANK, I'M REALLY SORRY, BUT I HAVE TO GO IN TO WORK.

325
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,801
IT'S ONE OF MY REGULARS

326
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,803
AND HE'S INSISTING THAT I DO HIM, SO...

327
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,305
HEY, WHAT KIND OF WORK DO YOU DO?

328
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,807
OH! I'M A MASSEUSE.

00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,309
I GIVE PEOPLE MASSAGES AND STUFF.

330
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:34,313
YOU... YOU WORK AT ONE OF THOSE MASSAGE PARLORS?

331
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,818
WELL, WE DON'T CALL IT THAT, BUT YEAH.

332
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,321

333
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,323
THAT'S WILD.

334
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,325
NO, I HAD NO IDEA.

335
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,827
ALL RIGHTY.

336
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,330
I'LL BE BACK IN A LITTLE BIT.

337
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,332
UNLESS YOU WANT TO COME WITH ME.

00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,334
YOU MEAN, LIKE, WATCH?

339
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,837
NO, NO. YOU CAN GET ONE YOURSELF.

340
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,339
IT'LL BE ON THE HOUSE, YOU KNOW...

341
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,341
WHAT ARE BIG SISTERS FOR?

342
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,845
I DON'T THINK THIS... YOU KNOW.

343
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,846
NO, NO, NO.

344
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,347
I WOULDN'T DO YOU MYSELF.

345
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,349
I MEAN, THAT WOULD BE WEIRD.

346
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,851
YEAH...

347
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,353

00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:32,371
IT'S LIKE THE FIRST BATHROOM FLOOR THERE EVER WAS.

355
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,873

WELL, CHANDLER PRINTED IT UP ON HIS COMPUTER.

367
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,901
AND WHO LAMINATED IT?

368
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,905
THAT WAS ME.

369
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,907

HE TOUCHED MY FANNY.

383
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,442
NO. SHE TOUCHED MINE FIRST.

384
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,443
THAT'S MY JOB.

385
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,945
SO WAIT. WHAT'S THE DEAL HERE?

386
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,447
I CAN HAVE SEX WITH YOU, BUT I CAN'T TOUCH YOU?

387
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,449
EWW! EWW!

388
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,951
YOU CAN'T HAVE SEX WITH HER.

389
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,953
WHAT DID YOU THINK I WAS, A HOOKER?

390
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,955
NO, OKAY, I KNOW-- YOU'RE A "MASSEUSE."

391
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,456
IT'S COOL. I'M NOT A COP.

392
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,460
HEY, JASMINE, CAN YOU ASK MR. WIFFLER

393
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,963
IF HE CAN WAIT FOR, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES?

394
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,464
FINE.

395
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,466
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

396
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,470
SO... THAT'S WHAT YOU THOUGHT I DID?!

397
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,972
GOD!

398
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,974
THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO!

399
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,475
WELL, THAT... THAT...

400
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,477
WELL, THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU DO?

401
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,479
NO!

402
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,481
WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

403
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,483
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, YOU KNOW...

404
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,485
THIS IS THE CITY, YOU KNOW?

405
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,987
I JUST... I MEAN, I...

406
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:28,988
I DON'T KNOW.

407
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,990
WHATEVER.

408
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,491
IT'S THE PERFECT END

409
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,493
TO THE PERFECT WEEKEND ANYWAY.

410
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:36,996
OH... WAIT.

411
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,497
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

412
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,499
NO, IT WAS PERFECT, UH...

413
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,003
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I SCREWED IT UP SO BAD.

414
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,006
YOU REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS PERFECT?

415
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,508
WELL, NO, MAYBE IT WASN'T PERFECT

416
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,011
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT WAS PRETTY COOL, YOU KNOW.

417
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,014
BECAUSE WE HAD ALL THOSE GREAT TALKS, YOU KNOW?

418
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,518
YEAH. UM...

419
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:03,022
WHICH ONES IN PARTICULAR WERE GREAT FOR YOU?

420
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,023
WELL, YOU KNOW

421
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,525
ABOUT THE TONGUE THING, YOU KNOW...

422
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,529
AND HOW I TOLD YOU ABOUT MY LIKES AND MY DISLIKES.

423
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,031
I DON'T...

424
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,532
HOW I LIKE TO MELT STUFF

425
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,534
AND HOW I DISLIKE STUFF THAT DOESN'T MELT?

426
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,536
RIGHT. OKAY.

427
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,537
MM HMM.

428
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,039
YEAH, YOU KNOW...

429
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,042
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I CAN REALLY TALK TO YOU

430
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,544
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE MY SISTER. YOU KNOW?

431
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,048
YEAH.

432
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,549
I GUESS I DO. YEAH.

433
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,552
AND THEN I GO FEEL YOUR FRIEND UP

434
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,554
AND MAKE YOU MAD AT ME.

435
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,556
WELL, I WASN'T HOPPING MAD...

436
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,558
YOU KNOW...

437
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,061
YOU HOPPED A LITTLE BIT.

438
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,566
YEAH, I'M REALLY SORRY... REALLY.

439
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,070
WELL, OKAY.

440
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,071
ALL RIGHT, WELL

441
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,073
THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE WEEKEND.

442
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,574
RIGHT NOW. THIS.

443
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,575
THIS? UH HUH.

444
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,078
OH, COME ON. WE WENT TO TIMES SQUARE.

445
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,579
WE... WE FOUND NINJA STARS.

446
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,582
I ALMOST GET MY ARM BROKEN BY A HOOKER...

447
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,084
SHE'S NOT A HOOKER.

448
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,087
WHEN I TELL MY FRIENDS ABOUT HER, SHE WILL BE.

449
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,099
PHOEBE, WHAT'S THAT?

450
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,600
OH!

451
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,602
OH, FRANK JR. GAVE ME THIS BEFORE HE LEFT.

452
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,104
IT'S A PRESENT.

453
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,605
IT USED TO BELONG TO OUR DAD.

454
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,607
IT WAS HIS GARAGE DOOR OPENER

455
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,109
TILL FRANK MELTED IT.

456
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,610

457
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,112
COOL!

458
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,119
SOUND THE BELL.

459
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,621
GATHER UP ALL THE MEN YOU CAN FIND.

460
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,624
WE GOT OURSELVES AN ENTERTAINMENT UNIT RAISING.

461
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,629
NO, SERIOUSLY, CAN YOU HELP US?

462
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,634
OKAY. ON THREE.

463
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,636
ONE, TWO...

464
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,138
WHY DON'T WE JUST GO ON TWO?

465
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,639
WHY TWO?

466
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,141
BECAUSE IT'S FASTER.

467
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,643
I COULD HAVE COUNTED TO THREE, LIKE, FOUR TIMES

468
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,644
WITHOUT ALL THIS "TWO" TALK.

469
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,146
ALL RIGHT, BUT IN THE FUTURE...

470
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,647
OKAY, OKAY.

471
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,649
HEAVY THING, NOT GETTING LIGHTER.

472
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,651
OKAY. ONE, TWO...

473
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,153
SO WE ARE GOING WITH TWO?

474
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,654
 OH!

475
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,165
A GOOD JOB, JOE.

476
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,667
WOW.

477
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,169
IT'S BIG.

478
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,171
 YEAH. YEAH.

479
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,174
SO BIG, THAT IT ACTUALLY MAKES OUR DOORS LOOK SMALLER.

480
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,176
MAYBE MY RULER'S WRONG.

481
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,179
MAYBE ALL THE RULERS ARE WRONG.

482
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,680
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

483
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,681
SO WHAT?

484
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,683
IT BLOCKS A LITTLE OF YOUR DOOR

485
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,684
A LITTLE OF MY DOOR.

486
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,186
I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

487
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,189
HOW ABOUT IT BLOCKS NONE OF MY DOOR AND A LOT

488
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,691
OF YOUR DOOR?

489
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,193
OKAY. LISTEN, BEFORE I FORGET

490
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,695
THAT SIDE IS STILL WET.

491
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,206
ARM HAIR STUCK. ARM HAIR STUCK!

492
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,711
OKAY, SIR

493
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,214
LET ME JUST SEE IF I'VE GOT THIS RIGHT.

494
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,716
SO THIS IS A HALF CAF, DOUBLE TALL

495
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,717
EASY HAZELNUT

496
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:23,722
NONFAT, NO FOAM, WITH WHIP, EXTRA HOT LATTE, RIGHT?

497
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,724
OKAY. GREAT.

498
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,726
YOU FREAK.

499
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,234
THANK YOU.

500
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,736
COFFEE TO GO, PLEASE.

501
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,739

502
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,741
ISABELLA ROSSELLINI!

503
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,742
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

504
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,244
OH, MY GOD.

505
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,747
DAMN, I CANNOT BELIEVE I TOOK HER OFF MY LIST.

506
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:52,251
WHY? BECAUSE OTHERWISE, YOU'D "GO FOR IT"?

507
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,752

508
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,255
YEAH. MAYBE.

509
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,257
OH HO! YOU LIE.

510
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,759
WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK I'D GO UP TO HER?

511
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,763
ROSS, IT TOOK YOU TEN YEARS TO FINALLY ADMIT YOU LIKED ME.

512
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,766
YEAH?

513
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:12,271
WELL, MISSY, YOU BETTER BE GLAD THAT LIST IS LAMINATED.

514
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,272
YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?

515
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,773
YOU GO AHEAD.

516
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,775
WE'LL CALL HER AN ALTERNATE.

517
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,776
OKAY.

518
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,777
ALL RIGHT.

519
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,778
HOLD MY CRULLER.

520
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,280
OKAY.

521
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,283
RACH, ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO LET HIM DO THIS?

522
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,785
HONEY, HE'S ABOUT TO GO HIT ON ISABELLA ROSSELLINI.

523
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,288
I'M JUST SORRY WE DON'T GOT POPCORN.

524
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,792
HI...

525
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,793
HI.

526
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,295
I'M ROSS.

527
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,796
UM, YOU DON'T KNOW ME

528
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,299
BUT I'M A BIG, BIG FAN OF YOURS.

529
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,302
I MEAN, UM, BLUE VELVET... WHOO!

530
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,308
I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD MAYBE BUY YOU

531
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,809
A, UM, CUP OF COFFEE.

532
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,312
OR... REIMBURSE YOU FOR THAT ONE.

533
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,813

534
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,316
AREN'T YOU WITH THAT GIRL OVER THERE?

535
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,821
WELL, YEAH. KIND OF.

536
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,323
UM, BUT THAT'S OKAY.

537
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,824
SEE, WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING.

538
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,327
UM, SEE, WE EACH HAVE THIS LIST

539
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,330
OF FIVE FAMOUS PEOPLE, AND YOU WERE ONE OF MINE.

540
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,332
SO I'M ALLOWED TO SLEEP WITH YOU.

541
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,334
NO, NO, NO.

542
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,336
IT'S FLATTERING.

543
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,838
WHOA!

544
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,340
I DON'T KNOW... W WAIT...

545
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,841
WAIT. ISABELLA...

546
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,842

547
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,844
DON'T DON'T JUST DISMISS THIS SO FAST.

548
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:26,845
I MEAN, THIS IS

549
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,847
A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY.

550
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:29,848
YEAH, FOR YOU.

551
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,852
IS THAT THE LIST?

552
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,353
UM, YES.

553
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,354
CAN I SEE IT?

554
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,355
UM, NO.

555
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,356
COME ON.

556
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,357
BUT, OKAY...

557
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,359
I'M NOT ON THE LIST.

558
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,362
UM, SEE, BUT THAT'S NOT THE FINAL DRAFT.

559
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,864
IT'S LAMINATED.

560
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,366
YEAH...

561
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,868
UM, OKAY, SO YOU WERE-- YOU WERE ON MY LIST

562
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:50,869
BUT THEN

563
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,871
MY FRIEND CHANDLER...

564
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,373

565
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,875
BROUGHT UP THE VERY GOOD POINT

566
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,877
