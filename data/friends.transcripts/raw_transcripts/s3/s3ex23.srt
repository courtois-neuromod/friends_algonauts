1723
01:09:54,392 --> 01:09:55,893
HEY, WOULDN'T IT BE COOL

1724
01:09:55,893 --> 01:09:58,396
IF OUR DUCK AND OUR CHICK HAD A LITTLE BABY?

1725
01:09:58,396 --> 01:09:59,897
WE COULD CALL IT CHUCK.

1726
01:10:00,898 --> 01:10:04,402
OR DICK.

1727
01:10:04,402 --> 01:10:05,403
HEY.

1728
01:10:05,403 --> 01:10:06,404
HEY. HEY.

1729
01:10:06,404 --> 01:10:08,406
LISTEN, I NEED A FAVOR.

1730
01:10:08,406 --> 01:10:11,409
UM... I WAS IN THE SHOWER

1731
01:10:11,409 --> 01:10:13,911
AND AS I WAS CLEANSING MYSELF

1732
01:10:13,911 --> 01:10:16,414
I, UH... WELL, I FELT SOMETHING.

1733
01:10:16,414 --> 01:10:19,917
WAS IT LIKE A SNEEZE, ONLY BETTER?

1734
01:10:19,917 --> 01:10:24,422
NO, NO, I MEAN LIKE A THING ON MY BODY.

1735
01:10:24,422 --> 01:10:25,923
WELL, WHAT WAS IT?

1736
01:10:25,923 --> 01:10:27,425
I DON'T KNOW.

1737
01:10:27,425 --> 01:10:29,927
IT'S KIND OF IN A PLACE THAT'S NOT...

1738
01:10:29,927 --> 01:10:31,929
IT'S NOT VISUALLY ACCESSIBLE TO ME.

1739
01:10:31,929 --> 01:10:34,432
AND I WAS HOPING MAYBE YOU GUYS COULD, COULD...

1740
01:10:34,932 --> 01:10:35,933
HELP ME OUT.

1741
01:10:35,933 --> 01:10:37,435
WHOA! WHOA! NO!

1742
01:10:37,435 --> 01:10:38,936
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

1743
01:10:38,936 --> 01:10:39,937
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

1744
01:10:40,438 --> 01:10:40,938
UH UH UH!

1745
01:10:41,439 --> 01:10:41,939

01:10:44,442 --> 01:10:45,943
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

1748
01:10:45,943 --> 01:10:47,945
IS IT A MOLE?

1749
01:10:48,946 --> 01:10:51,449
NO, IT'S TOO WRINKLY TO BE A MOLE.

1750
01:10:51,449 --> 01:10:53,951
IS IT, WHAT, A PIMPLE?

1751
01:10:56,954 --> 01:10:58,956
NO, IT'S...

1752
01:10:58,956 --> 01:11:01,459
FANCIER THAN A PIMPLE.

1753
01:11:01,459 --> 01:11:02,960
LOOK, ROSS...

1754
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:03,961
HEY, GUYS, WHAT'S...?

01:11:07,965 --> 01:11:10,468
OKAY, WELL, IT'S DEFINITE--

01:11:10,468 --> 01:11:11,969
TWO MORE WEEKS OF WINTER.

1757
01:11:11,969 --> 01:11:12,970
YEAH. RIGHT.

1758
01:11:14,472 --> 01:11:19,477

1759
01:11:19,477 --> 01:11:24,482

1760
01:11:24,482 --> 01:11:26,984

1761
01:11:26,984 --> 01:11:29,487

1762
01:11:29,487 --> 01:11:33,491
?  ?

1763
01:11:33,491 --> 01:11:35,993
?  ?

1764
01:11:35,993 --> 01:11:39,497
?  ?

1765
01:11:39,497 --> 01:11:43,000
?  ?

1766
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,503
?  ?

1767
01:11:45,503 --> 01:11:48,005

1768
01:11:48,005 --> 01:11:50,508

1769
01:11:50,508 --> 01:11:53,010

1770
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:59,517
?  ?

1771
01:12:03,521 --> 01:12:05,523
OKAY, AND THIS IS THE COFFEEHOUSE.

1772
01:12:05,523 --> 01:12:07,525
THIS IS WHERE I PLAY MY MUSIC.

1773
01:12:07,525 --> 01:12:08,526
GOOD DEAL.

1774
01:12:08,526 --> 01:12:10,528
YEAH, AND THESE ARE MY FRIENDS.

1775
01:12:10,528 --> 01:12:12,029

HEY.

1778
01:12:15,032 --> 01:12:16,033
VINCE IS A FIREMAN.

1779
01:12:16,033 --> 01:12:17,535
 WOW! HAVE YOU EVER

1780
01:12:17,535 --> 01:12:20,037
RESCUED ANYONE FROM A BURNING BUILDING BEFORE?

1781
01:12:20,037 --> 01:12:21,038
98 HOT SAVES.

1782
01:12:21,038 --> 01:12:23,040
HIGHEST ON THE FORCE.

1783
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,042
YOU KNOW, IF JOEY AND I PLAY WITH MATCHES

1784
01:12:25,042 --> 01:12:27,044
WE COULD GET YOU UP TO AN EVEN 100.

1785
01:12:28,546 --> 01:12:31,549
FIRE SAFETY IS NOT A JOKE, SON.

1786
01:12:33,551 --> 01:12:35,052
YOU'RE RIGHT.

1787
01:12:35,052 --> 01:12:36,554
I KNOW.

1788
01:12:36,554 --> 01:12:38,055
LOOK, I GOT TO GO.

1789
01:12:38,055 --> 01:12:39,056
I'M ON CALL TONIGHT.

OKAY.

1792
01:12:41,559 --> 01:12:43,060
 WOW, HE'S CUTE, PHEEBS.

1793
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:45,563
BUT I THOUGHT YOU JUST STARTED DATING

1794
01:12:45,563 --> 01:12:47,064

1795
01:12:47,064 --> 01:12:48,065
OH, JASON?

1796
01:12:48,065 --> 01:12:49,567
YEAH. YEAH, UH HUH.

1797
01:12:49,567 --> 01:12:51,068
WE'RE SEEING EACH OTHER TONIGHT.

1798
01:12:51,569 --> 01:12:52,570
WHA... PHEEBS?!

1799
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:54,071
TWO DATES IN ONE DAY?

1800
01:12:54,071 --> 01:12:55,573
THAT'S SO UNLIKE YOU.

1801
01:12:55,573 --> 01:12:56,574
I KNOW, I KNOW.

1802
01:12:56,574 --> 01:12:59,076
I'M LIKE PLAYING THE FIELD, YOU KNOW.

1803
01:12:59,076 --> 01:13:00,578
JUGGLING TWO GUYS.

1804
01:13:00,578 --> 01:13:02,580
I'M SOWING MY WILD OATS.

1805
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:05,082
YOU KNOW, I'M THIS KIND OF, LIKE, YOU KNOW

1806
01:13:05,082 --> 01:13:07,585
OAT SOWING, FIELD PLAYING JUGGLER.

1807
01:13:07,585 --> 01:13:09,587
SO, PHEEBS, DO THEY KNOW ABOUT EACH OTHER?

1808
01:13:09,587 --> 01:13:12,590
DOES A DOG'S LIPS MOVE WHEN HE READS?

1809
01:13:15,593 --> 01:13:19,096
OKAY, NO, THEY DON'T KNOW.

1810
01:13:20,598 --> 01:13:21,599
HEY, GUYS.

1811
01:13:21,599 --> 01:13:23,100
 HEY.

1812
01:13:24,602 --> 01:13:25,603
WELL?

1813
01:13:25,603 --> 01:13:27,104
HOW DID IT GO AT THE DOCTOR'S?

1814
01:13:27,605 --> 01:13:30,608
WELL, HE SAID THERE'S DEFINITELY NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

1815
01:13:30,608 --> 01:13:31,609
IT'S TOTALLY BENIGN.

1816
01:13:31,609 --> 01:13:33,110
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

1817
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:35,613
HE COULDN'T EVEN TELL ME.

1818
01:13:35,613 --> 01:13:39,116
HE SAID IT WAS JUST SOME SORT OF SKIN ABNORMALITY.

1819
01:13:39,116 --> 01:13:41,118
SO IT'S JUST SKIN?

1820
01:13:41,118 --> 01:13:44,622
WELL, NO. HE SAID IT'S "SKIN LIKE."

1821
01:13:44,622 --> 01:13:46,123
OKAY, SO IT'S NOT SKIN.

1822
01:13:46,123 --> 01:13:49,126
WELL, IT'S IN THE SKIN FAMILY.

1823
01:13:49,126 --> 01:13:50,127
AND THE WORST THING IS

1824
01:13:50,628 --> 01:13:52,630
HE SAID, WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY IT

1825
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:54,632
HE WAS RELUCTANT TO REMOVE IT.

1826
01:13:54,632 --> 01:13:55,633
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

1827
01:13:55,633 --> 01:13:57,134
YOU SHOULD GO TO MY GUY.

1828
01:13:57,134 --> 01:14:00,137
BECAUSE WHEN I WENT IN THERE WITH MY THIRD NIPPLE...

1829
01:14:00,137 --> 01:14:03,140
HE JUST LOPPED IT RIGHT OFF, YOU KNOW?

1830
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:04,642
SO I GUESS I'M LUCKY.

1831
01:14:04,642 --> 01:14:06,644
I MEAN, NOT AS LUCKY AS PEOPLE

1832
01:14:06,644 --> 01:14:09,146
WHO ARE BORN WITH TWO NIPPLES.

1833
01:14:09,146 --> 01:14:12,149
WELL, AT LEAST THEY KNEW WHAT YOURS WAS.

1834
01:14:12,149 --> 01:14:13,150
YOURS HAD A NAME.

1835
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:14,151
OH!

1836
01:14:14,151 --> 01:14:17,154
MAYBE THEY'LL NAME YOURS AFTER YOU.

1837
01:14:17,154 --> 01:14:19,657
YOU KNOW, THEY'D CALL IT "THE ROSS."

1838
01:14:19,657 --> 01:14:21,158
AND THEN PEOPLE WOULD BE, LIKE

1839
01:14:21,158 --> 01:14:24,662
"OH, HE'S GOT A ROSS."

1840
01:14:24,662 --> 01:14:27,164
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE COOL.

1841
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:30,668
PETE'S BREAKING UP WITH ME.

1842
01:14:30,668 --> 01:14:31,669
WHAT? WHAT?

1843
01:14:31,669 --> 01:14:34,672
I JUST CHECKED MY MESSAGES

1844
01:14:34,672 --> 01:14:36,674
AND HE SAID THAT, WHEN HE GETS BACK FROM ATLANTA

1845
01:14:36,674 --> 01:14:38,175
"WE NEED TO TALK."

1846
01:14:38,175 --> 01:14:40,177
WELL, THAT'S IT. AND?

1847
01:14:40,177 --> 01:14:42,179
PEOPLE NEVER SAY, "WE NEED TO TALK"

1848
01:14:42,179 --> 01:14:43,681
UNLESS IT'S SOMETHING BAD.

1849
01:14:43,681 --> 01:14:45,182
WHOA. THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN

1850
01:14:45,683 --> 01:14:46,684
HE'S BREAKING UP WITH YOU.

1851
01:14:46,684 --> 01:14:48,185
REALLY?

1852
01:14:48,185 --> 01:14:51,689
YEAH, MAYBE HE JUST CHEATED ON YOU.

1853
01:14:55,192 --> 01:14:57,194
AND I KNOW I'LL NEVER GET RICH DOING IT

1854
01:14:57,194 --> 01:14:58,696
BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU

1855
01:14:58,696 --> 01:14:59,697
IT'S PRETTY COOL KNOWING

1856
01:15:00,197 --> 01:15:02,700
THAT YOU'RE MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN A KID'S LIFE.

1857
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,201
THAT IS SO GREAT.

1858
01:15:04,201 --> 01:15:05,202
I...

1859
01:15:05,202 --> 01:15:07,204
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD!

1860
01:15:07,204 --> 01:15:10,207
UH, WE BETTER CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

1861
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,709
NO! NO! NO? NO?

1862
01:15:11,709 --> 01:15:13,210
WELL, WE DON'T...

1863
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:14,712
WE DON'T NEED A FIREMAN.

1864
01:15:14,712 --> 01:15:16,714
WE... NEED, LIKE, A GOOD MECHANIC.

1865
01:15:16,714 --> 01:15:18,215

1866
01:15:18,215 --> 01:15:19,216
WHAT?

1867
01:15:19,717 --> 01:15:20,718
WELL, IT'S PROBABLY

1868
01:15:20,718 --> 01:15:22,219
JUST REALLY LOW ON COOLANT.

1869
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,221
OH, MY GOD! HERE THEY COME.

1870
01:15:24,221 --> 01:15:25,723
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

1871
01:15:25,723 --> 01:15:27,224
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. WHY?

1872
01:15:27,224 --> 01:15:30,227
LOOK, IF I WANTED TO SEE A FIREMAN

1873
01:15:30,227 --> 01:15:32,229
I WOULD DATE ONE, OKAY?

1874
01:15:32,229 --> 01:15:34,231
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

1875
01:15:34,231 --> 01:15:35,232
A THIRD NIPPLE.

1876
01:15:35,232 --> 01:15:38,736
JUST YOUR RUN OF THE MILL THIRD NIPPLE.

1877
01:15:38,736 --> 01:15:39,737
YOU CAN TAKE IT OFF.

1878
01:15:39,737 --> 01:15:41,739
JUST SLICE THAT BABY RIGHT OFF.

1879
01:15:41,739 --> 01:15:42,740
TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF

1880
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:45,743
AND LET'S SEE WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE.

1881
01:15:47,745 --> 01:15:50,247
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1882
01:15:50,247 --> 01:15:52,249
JUST SHOWING YOU MY RUN OF THE MILL

1883
01:15:52,249 --> 01:15:54,752
SLICE IT RIGHT OFF THIRD NIPPLE.

1884
01:15:54,752 --> 01:15:57,755
WELL, THAT'S NOT A THIRD NIPPLE.

1885
01:15:57,755 --> 01:16:01,258
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S ON YOUR ASS.

1886
01:16:01,258 --> 01:16:03,260
WELL, THEN, WHAT IS IT?

1887
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:05,262
WAIT A MINUTE. HOLD IT.

1888
01:16:06,764 --> 01:16:08,766
JOHNSON, WILL YOU COME IN HERE A MOMENT?

1889
01:16:08,766 --> 01:16:10,267
I'M WITH HAMILTON.

1890
01:16:10,267 --> 01:16:11,769
HE'S GOOD WITH WEIRD THINGS.

1891
01:16:11,769 --> 01:16:13,270
BRING HIM IN, TOO.

1892
01:16:16,273 --> 01:16:18,776
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF?

1893
01:16:18,776 --> 01:16:20,778
TOPLESS TAP DANCING.

1894
01:16:23,781 --> 01:16:26,283
I REALLY ENJOY THESE LITTLE TALKS WE HAVE.

1895
01:16:27,785 --> 01:16:30,287
I GOT TO GO WATER PETE'S PLANTS.

1896
01:16:30,287 --> 01:16:31,789
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1897
01:16:31,789 --> 01:16:33,791
IF HE'S GOING TO BREAK UP WITH ME

1898
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:35,292
MAYBE I WON'T WATER HIS PLANTS.

1899
01:16:35,292 --> 01:16:36,794
IF HE'S GOING TO BREAK UP WITH YOU

1900
01:16:36,794 --> 01:16:39,296
MAYBE JOEY AND I SHOULD WATER HIS PLANTS.

1901
01:16:41,298 --> 01:16:44,301
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

1902
01:16:44,301 --> 01:16:45,302
OR...

1903
01:16:45,302 --> 01:16:46,804

1904
01:16:46,804 --> 01:16:48,305
WE COULD GO OVER THERE

1905
01:16:48,305 --> 01:16:50,808
AND PEE ON THEM.

1906
01:16:50,808 --> 01:16:51,809
I CAN'T TAKE IT, YOU KNOW?

1907
01:16:52,309 --> 01:16:54,311
I'M ALWAYS AFRAID ONE OF THEM IS GOING

1908
01:16:54,311 --> 01:16:55,813
TO CATCH ME WITH THE OTHER ONE.

1909
01:16:55,813 --> 01:16:57,314
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY.

1910
01:16:57,314 --> 01:16:58,816
WELL, HONEY, THEN WHY DON'T YOU

1911
01:16:58,816 --> 01:17:00,317
BREAK UP WITH ONE OF THEM?

1912
01:17:00,317 --> 01:17:01,318
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

1913
01:17:01,318 --> 01:17:03,821
WHAT... WHAT HAPPENED TO PLAYING THE FIELD?

1914
01:17:04,321 --> 01:17:07,324
WELL, IT JUST DOESN'T FEEL LIKE PLAYING ANYMORE.

1915
01:17:07,324 --> 01:17:08,826
IT FEELS LIKE WORK.

1916
01:17:08,826 --> 01:17:10,828
IT'S LIKE I'M WORKING IN THE FIELD.

1917
01:17:10,828 --> 01:17:13,330
SO, PHEEBS, PICK ONE OF THEM.

1918
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:14,331
YEAH, WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE MORE?

1919
01:17:14,331 --> 01:17:16,834
WELL, VINCE IS GREAT, YOU KNOW

1920
01:17:16,834 --> 01:17:20,337
BECAUSE HE'S LIKE... HE'S A GUY GUY, YOU KNOW.

1921
01:17:20,337 --> 01:17:22,339
HE'S JUST SO BURLY.

1922
01:17:22,339 --> 01:17:23,340
SO VERY BURLY.

1923
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:26,343
OKAY, GOOD, SO THERE YOU GO.

1924
01:17:26,343 --> 01:17:27,845
GO WITH VINCE.

1925
01:17:27,845 --> 01:17:29,847
YEAH, BUT JASON'S REALLY SENSITIVE.

1926
01:17:29,847 --> 01:17:31,849
WELL, SENSITIVE IS IMPORTANT. PICK HIM.

1927
01:17:31,849 --> 01:17:33,350
YEAH.

1928
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:35,352
OH, SURE, GO WITH THE SISSY.

1929
01:17:37,354 --> 01:17:38,856
JASON IS NOT A SISSY.

1930
01:17:39,356 --> 01:17:39,857
NO, NO, NO.

1931
01:17:40,357 --> 01:17:42,359
I MEANT CHANDLER.

1932
01:17:52,369 --> 01:17:56,373
YOU KNOW, I HAVE DINNER PLANS.

1933
01:17:56,373 --> 01:17:58,375
THANK YOU SO MUCH

1934
01:17:58,375 --> 01:18:00,377
FOR COMING ON SUCH A SHORT NOTICE.

1935
01:18:00,377 --> 01:18:01,879
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN

1936
01:18:01,879 --> 01:18:04,381
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING MEDICINE

1937
01:18:04,381 --> 01:18:05,883
FOR 23 YEARS AND...

1938
01:18:05,883 --> 01:18:07,384
I'M STUMPED.

1939
01:18:09,887 --> 01:18:12,890

1940
01:18:19,396 --> 01:18:20,898
THIS IS THE DEN.

1941
01:18:20,898 --> 01:18:22,399
ALL RIGHT, CHECK THIS OUT.

1942
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:23,400

1943
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:24,401
WHOA!

1944
01:18:24,401 --> 01:18:25,903
ALL RIGHT, LESS LIGHTS.

1945
01:18:25,903 --> 01:18:26,904
BAD LIGHTS.

1946
01:18:26,904 --> 01:18:28,906
LIGHTS GO AWAY.

1947
01:18:30,908 --> 01:18:33,410
SEE, YOU JUST NEED TO FIND THE RIGHT COMMAND.

1948
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:35,913
YES... AND THE DIMMER SWITCH.

1949
01:18:35,913 --> 01:18:36,914
WHOA.

1950
01:18:36,914 --> 01:18:39,917
FOR A RICH GUY, THAT'S A PRETTY SMALL TV.

1951
01:18:39,917 --> 01:18:40,918
NO, NO, THAT'S THE VIDEO PHONE.

1952
01:18:40,918 --> 01:18:42,920
BUT, HEY, GUYS, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE

1953
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,421
SO PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING.

1954
01:18:44,421 --> 01:18:48,926
I KEA, THIS IS COMFORTABLE.

1955
01:18:48,926 --> 01:18:50,928
THIS PLACE IS AMAZING.

1956
01:18:50,928 --> 01:18:53,931
GOD, THAT IS THE NICEST KITCHEN.

1957
01:18:53,931 --> 01:18:54,932
I KNOW.

1958
01:18:54,932 --> 01:18:56,934
NO, BUT IT'S THEN ICEST KITCHEN.

1959
01:18:56,934 --> 01:18:58,936
THE REFRIGERATOR TOLD ME TO HAVE A GREAT DAY.

1960
01:19:00,938 --> 01:19:02,940
LOOK AT THIS-- A MILLIONAIRE'S CHECKBOOK.

1961
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:04,441
JOEY, PUT THAT DOWN.

1962
01:19:04,441 --> 01:19:05,442

1963
01:19:05,442 --> 01:19:06,944
OH, MY GOD, THAT'S PETE.

1964
01:19:06,944 --> 01:19:07,945
OKAY, GET OUT.

1965
01:19:07,945 --> 01:19:10,447
HOW THE HELL DO YOU ANSWER A VIDEO PHONE?

1966
01:19:10,447 --> 01:19:11,448
Monica?

1967
01:19:13,951 --> 01:19:15,953
I GUESS THAT'S HOW.

1968
01:19:15,953 --> 01:19:17,955
Hey, Monica, how's it going?

1969
01:19:17,955 --> 01:19:18,956
OH, IT'S GOOD.

1970
01:19:18,956 --> 01:19:20,457
IT'S... IT'S GOOD.

1971
01:19:20,457 --> 01:19:22,459
JUST HERE WATERING THE PLANTS.

1972
01:19:22,459 --> 01:19:24,461
Don't forget that ficus over there by Rachel.

1973
01:19:25,963 --> 01:19:26,964
HA HA.

1974
01:19:26,964 --> 01:19:28,966
CHANDLER'S ON THE COUCH.

1975
01:19:30,467 --> 01:19:31,468
Yeah, I see him.

1976
01:19:31,468 --> 01:19:33,470
You guys are just the worst hiders ever.

1977
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:34,972
HEY, PETE. HEY, PETE.

1978
01:19:34,972 --> 01:19:35,973

01:19:35,973 --> 01:19:36,974
Hey, guys.

01:19:36,974 --> 01:19:38,475
UH, PETE, THE OTHER DAY

1981
01:19:38,475 --> 01:19:40,978
WHEN YOU SAID YOU NEEDED TO TALK--

1982
01:19:40,978 --> 01:19:43,981
JUST SO I KNOW-- IS IT GOOD NEWS OR BAD NEWS?

1983
01:19:43,981 --> 01:19:44,982
Oh, it's good news.

1984
01:19:44,982 --> 01:19:46,984
No, it's definitely good news.

1985
01:19:46,984 --> 01:19:48,986
Hold on a second. I have another call.

1986
01:19:48,986 --> 01:19:51,488
Hey, how's it going?

1987
01:19:51,488 --> 01:19:53,490
NO, IT'S STILL ME.

1988
01:19:53,490 --> 01:19:54,491
No, it's not.

1989
01:19:54,491 --> 01:19:55,492

1990
01:19:55,492 --> 01:19:57,494

1991
01:19:57,494 --> 01:19:58,495
Yeah? Okay.

1992
01:19:58,495 --> 01:20:00,497
I'm going to have to call you back later.

1993
01:20:00,497 --> 01:20:02,499
Monica, you-- I'm going to have to call you back.

1994
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,001
OH, OH, OKAY.

1995
01:20:04,001 --> 01:20:06,503
UM, SO I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

1996
01:20:06,503 --> 01:20:07,504
Okay. I love you.

1997
01:20:07,504 --> 01:20:08,505
I LOVE YOU.

1998
01:20:08,505 --> 01:20:10,507
 WE LOVE YOU.

1999
01:20:12,509 --> 01:20:13,510
OKAY.

2000
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:15,012
WELL, IT'S GOOD NEWS.

2001
01:20:15,012 --> 01:20:16,013
IT'S GOOD NEWS.

2002
01:20:16,013 --> 01:20:17,514
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THE GOOD NEWS IS?

2003
01:20:17,514 --> 01:20:19,016
WOW, LOOK AT THIS.

2004
01:20:19,016 --> 01:20:23,520
HE WROTE A CHECK FOR $50,000 TO "HUGO LINDGREN'S RING DESIGN."

2005
01:20:25,022 --> 01:20:26,023
OH, SORRY.

2006
01:20:26,523 --> 01:20:28,025
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE GOOD NEWS IS?

2007
01:20:30,027 --> 01:20:32,029
OH, MY.

2008
01:20:32,029 --> 01:20:34,031
MONICA'S GOING TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE!

2009
01:20:34,031 --> 01:20:36,033
YOU'VE GOT TO GET MOM ON THE PHONE.

2010
01:20:36,033 --> 01:20:38,035
CALL MOM! CALL MOM!

2011
01:20:38,035 --> 01:20:40,537
Hello?

2012
01:20:40,537 --> 01:20:42,539
AND THAT'S PETE'S MOM.

2013
01:20:50,047 --> 01:20:54,051
YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO MAKE IT A THEME WEDDING

2014
01:20:54,051 --> 01:20:57,054
AND THE THEME COULD BE: "LOOK HOW MUCH MONEY

2015
01:20:57,054 --> 01:20:58,555
WE'VE GOT."

2016
01:20:58,555 --> 01:20:59,556
DO YOU KNOW?

2017
01:20:59,556 --> 01:21:01,558
YOU COULD PUT MONEY IN THE INVITATIONS

2018
01:21:01,558 --> 01:21:04,061
YOU COULD HAVE LIKE LITTLE MONEY PLACE SETTINGS

2019
01:21:04,561 --> 01:21:07,064
AND YOU COULD START WITH A MONEY SALAD.

2020
01:21:07,064 --> 01:21:10,567
I MEAN, IT'LL BE DRY, BUT PEOPLE WILL LIKE IT.

2021
01:21:10,567 --> 01:21:11,568
WOULD YOU STOP?

2022
01:21:11,568 --> 01:21:13,570
WE'VE ONLY BEEN GOING OUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

2023
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:15,072
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF HE'S GOING TO PROPOSE.

2024
01:21:15,572 --> 01:21:17,574
BUT THIS IS PETE, OKAY? HE'S NOT LIKE OTHER PEOPLE.

2025
01:21:17,574 --> 01:21:20,077
ON YOUR FIRST DATE, HE TOOK YOU TO ROME.

2026
01:21:20,077 --> 01:21:21,578
FOR MOST GUYS, THAT'S LIKE

2027
01:21:21,578 --> 01:21:24,081
A THIRD OR FOURTH DATE KIND OF THING.

2028
01:21:24,081 --> 01:21:26,083
WELL, IF THAT'S WHAT IT IS

2029
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:28,085
THEN IT'S... IT'S CRAZY.

2030
01:21:28,085 --> 01:21:29,586
MONICA'S RIGHT.

2031
01:21:29,586 --> 01:21:32,089
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GETTING MARRIED HERE, OKAY?

2032
01:21:32,089 --> 01:21:34,091
SHE CAN'T JUST RUSH INTO THIS.

2033
01:21:34,091 --> 01:21:36,093
OH, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

2034
01:21:36,093 --> 01:21:38,095
YOU MARRIED A LESBIAN.

2035
01:21:42,099 --> 01:21:44,101
YEAH, YOU COULD DO WORSE, MONICA.

2036
01:21:44,101 --> 01:21:45,602
HE'S A REALLY GOOD GUY.

2037
01:21:45,602 --> 01:21:47,104
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?

2038
01:21:47,104 --> 01:21:48,605
DON'T DECIDE NOW.

2039
01:21:48,605 --> 01:21:50,107
WAIT TILL YOU'RE IN THE MOMENT

2040
01:21:50,107 --> 01:21:51,108
AND WHATEVER YOU'RE FEELING

2041
01:21:51,108 --> 01:21:52,609
THAT WILL BE YOUR ANSWER.

2042
01:21:52,609 --> 01:21:55,112
YEAH. AND WHEN PETE GETS DOWN ON HIS KNEE

2043
01:21:55,112 --> 01:21:57,614
AND PULLS OUT THAT PUMPKIN SIZE DIAMOND RING...

2044
01:21:57,614 --> 01:21:59,616
ALL RIGHT, I GOT TO GO.

2045
01:21:59,616 --> 01:22:02,119
I HAVE TO BREAK UP WITH VINCE.

2046
01:22:02,119 --> 01:22:04,121
OH, SO YOU'RE GOING WITH THE TEACHER, HUH?

2047
01:22:04,121 --> 01:22:06,123
YEAH. I LIKE VINCE A LOT, YOU KNOW

2048
01:22:06,123 --> 01:22:08,625
BUT JASON IS SO SENSITIVE, YOU KNOW?

2049
01:22:08,625 --> 01:22:11,128
AND, IN THE LONG RUN, I THINK SENSITIVE IS BETTER

2050
01:22:11,128 --> 01:22:14,631
THAN HAVING JUST LIKE A REALLY, REALLY, REALLY NICE...

2051
01:22:14,631 --> 01:22:16,133
BODY.

2052
01:22:18,635 --> 01:22:21,638
JASON. DEFINITELY JASON.

2053
01:22:21,638 --> 01:22:22,639
OKAY, WISH ME LUCK.

2054
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:24,141
 GOOD LUCK.

2055
01:22:26,643 --> 01:22:29,146

2056
01:22:29,146 --> 01:22:30,147
SORRY.

2057
01:22:30,147 --> 01:22:31,648
I WAS JUST IMAGINING

2058
01:22:31,648 --> 01:22:35,152
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO CATCH THE MONEY BOUQUET.

2059
01:22:41,158 --> 01:22:42,159
EXCUSE ME.

2060
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:43,160
UM... IS VINCE HERE?

2061
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,661
OH, SURE.

2062
01:22:44,661 --> 01:22:46,163
VINCE!

2063
01:22:46,163 --> 01:22:47,164
YO!

2064
01:22:48,665 --> 01:22:51,168
WOW. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU GUYS ACTUALLY USED THOSE.

2065
01:22:51,168 --> 01:22:54,171
SO WHAT'S UP?

2066
01:22:54,171 --> 01:22:57,174
UM... WOW.

2067
01:22:57,674 --> 01:23:00,177
THIS THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE EASY, UM...

2068
01:23:00,177 --> 01:23:03,680
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD SEE EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

2069
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:07,184
UH HUH.

2070
01:23:07,184 --> 01:23:09,186
GOOD DEAL.

2071
01:23:09,186 --> 01:23:10,687
I'M SORRY.

2072
01:23:10,687 --> 01:23:12,189
NO, NO. IT'S OKAY.

2073
01:23:12,189 --> 01:23:13,690
IT'S JUST THAT, UH...

2074
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:16,193
I THOUGHT WE HAD SOMETHING PRETTY SPECIAL HERE

2075
01:23:16,193 --> 01:23:18,695
AND, YOU KNOW, I FELT LIKE YOU WERE SOMEONE

2076
01:23:18,695 --> 01:23:20,197
I COULD FINALLY OPEN UP TO

2077
01:23:20,697 --> 01:23:24,201
AND... THERE'S SO MUCH IN ME I HAVEN'T SHARED WITH YOU YET.

2078
01:23:24,201 --> 01:23:27,204
OH, MY GOD, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SO...

2079
01:23:27,204 --> 01:23:30,207
I'M SORRY. I CAN'T TALK.

2080
01:23:30,207 --> 01:23:32,709
I'M GOING TO GO WRITE IN MY JOURNAL.

2081
01:23:36,713 --> 01:23:38,715
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

2082
01:23:38,715 --> 01:23:41,218
 I'M TELLING YOU, IF YOU WANT

2083
01:23:41,218 --> 01:23:42,719
TO TAKE CARE OF THAT THING

2084
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:44,721
YOU SHOULD GO SEE MY HERBAL GUY.

2085
01:23:44,721 --> 01:23:46,723
THANK YOU, BUT I WANT TO REMOVE IT, PHEEBS.

2086
01:23:46,723 --> 01:23:48,225
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT SAVORY.

2087
01:23:48,225 --> 01:23:51,228
YOU KNOW, WHEN GIRLS SLEEP WITH GUYS

2088
01:23:51,228 --> 01:23:53,730
WITH WEIRD THINGS ON THEIR BODY

2089
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:56,233
THEY TELL THEIR FRIENDS ABOUT IT.

2090
01:23:57,234 --> 01:23:58,735
GIVE ME THIS.

2091
01:24:01,238 --> 01:24:03,740
HI. OKAY, DON'T BE MAD AT ME

2092
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:05,742
BUT I COULDN'T RESIST.

2093
01:24:05,742 --> 01:24:07,244
BRIDES MAGAZINES?

2094
01:24:07,244 --> 01:24:08,745
YES, AND I KNOW THAT YOU SAID

2095
01:24:08,745 --> 01:24:10,247
YOU WOULD SAY NO IF HE ASKED YOU

2096
01:24:10,247 --> 01:24:11,248
BUT I'M SORRY.

2097
01:24:11,248 --> 01:24:13,750
HOW GREAT WOULD YOU LOOK WALKING DOWN THE AISLE

2098
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:15,252
IN THIS DONNA KARAN.

2099
01:24:15,252 --> 01:24:16,253

2100
01:24:16,253 --> 01:24:17,754
OH, YOU SO WOULD.

2101
01:24:17,754 --> 01:24:20,757
OH, YOU SHOULD GET THAT ANYWAY.

2102
01:24:22,259 --> 01:24:24,261
WELL, FOR CLUBBING.

2103
01:24:24,261 --> 01:24:25,762
IT IS SO WEIRD.

2104
01:24:25,762 --> 01:24:27,764
I KNOW WHAT I SAID, BUT, UM...

2105
01:24:27,764 --> 01:24:30,267
THIS MORNING, I WAS LYING IN BED.

2106
01:24:30,267 --> 01:24:33,770
I WAS, I WAS IMAGINING WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO SAY YES.

2107
01:24:34,771 --> 01:24:36,773
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE SUDDEN

2108
01:24:37,274 --> 01:24:38,775
AND IT'S A LITTLE RUSHED

2109
01:24:38,775 --> 01:24:40,277
AND IT'S TOTALLY NOT LIKE ME

2110
01:24:40,277 --> 01:24:42,779
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS, BUT...

2111
01:24:42,779 --> 01:24:45,282
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I CAN'T, RIGHT?

2112
01:24:45,282 --> 01:24:47,284
I MEAN, I'M I'M CRAZY ABOUT PETE

2113
01:24:47,284 --> 01:24:50,287
AND I I KNOW THAT WE WANT THE SAME THINGS

2114
01:24:50,287 --> 01:24:53,290
AND WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT SAYING YES

2115
01:24:53,290 --> 01:24:55,292
IT MADE ME REALLY HAPPY.

2116
01:24:55,292 --> 01:24:56,793
OH, MY GOD.

2117
01:24:58,295 --> 01:24:59,796
I KNOW.

2118
01:24:59,796 --> 01:25:01,798
I NEED MORE PIE.

2119
01:25:04,301 --> 01:25:06,303
HEY, MON, UM, IF YOU DO GET MARRIED

2120
01:25:06,303 --> 01:25:09,306
CAN I BRING TWO GUESTS?

2121
01:25:09,306 --> 01:25:10,807
YOU DIDN'T BREAK UP

2122
01:25:10,807 --> 01:25:12,809
WITH THAT FIREMAN?

2123
01:25:12,809 --> 01:25:15,312
NO. THAT WAS MY WAY OF TELLING YOU.

2124
01:25:15,312 --> 01:25:18,815
WELL, IT TURNS OUT HE'S INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE.

2125
01:25:18,815 --> 01:25:21,318
HE KEEPS A JOURNAL AND HE PAINTS.

2126
01:25:21,318 --> 01:25:23,320
HE EVEN SHOWED ME CHARCOAL DRAWINGS

2127
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,821
THAT HE DREW OF ME.

2128
01:25:24,821 --> 01:25:25,822
WOW.

2129
01:25:25,822 --> 01:25:27,824
YEAH. WELL, HE'D PREFER WATERCOLORS

2130
01:25:27,824 --> 01:25:29,326
BUT HE HAS EASY ACCESS

2131
01:25:29,326 --> 01:25:31,828
TO A LOT OF CHARCOAL.

2132
01:25:31,828 --> 01:25:33,830
SO, THEN, ARE YOU GOING TO DUMP JASON?

2133
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:37,334
WELL, YEAH, BECAUSE I HAVE TO BREAK UP WITH SOMEONE, AND...

2134
01:25:37,334 --> 01:25:39,336
OKAY, SO JASON IS SENSITIVE

2135
01:25:39,336 --> 01:25:41,338
BUT, NOW, SO IS VINCE.

2136
01:25:41,338 --> 01:25:44,841
PLUS, VINCE HAS THE BODY, YOU KNOW, SO...

2137
01:25:46,343 --> 01:25:49,346
IT'S REALLY JUST ABOUT THE MATH.

2138
01:25:54,851 --> 01:25:56,353

2139
01:25:56,353 --> 01:25:57,354
JASON?

2140
01:25:57,354 --> 01:25:58,855
YEAH? COME ON IN.

2141
01:26:04,861 --> 01:26:07,364
SO, PHOEBE

2142
01:26:07,364 --> 01:26:09,866
YOU, UH, SOUNDED KIND OF SERIOUS ON THE PHONE.

2143
01:26:09,866 --> 01:26:11,368
IS, UH, IS ANYTHING WRONG?

2144
01:26:11,868 --> 01:26:13,370
NUH UH.

2145
01:26:28,885 --> 01:26:31,888
YOU MUST BE ROSS.

2146
01:26:31,888 --> 01:26:32,889
HI.

2147
01:26:32,889 --> 01:26:35,892
I AM GURU SAJ.

2148
01:26:36,893 --> 01:26:39,396
LISTEN, I GOT TO TELL YOU

2149
01:26:39,396 --> 01:26:42,399
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A GURU BEFORE, SO...

2150
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:44,901
WELL, RELAX. IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER

2151
01:26:44,901 --> 01:26:47,404
I'VE ATTENDED SOME OF THE FINEST MEDICAL SCHOOLS

2152
01:26:47,404 --> 01:26:48,905
IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

2153
01:26:48,905 --> 01:26:50,907
WELL, THEN, LET'S TAKE A LOOK

2154
01:26:50,907 --> 01:26:52,909
AT THIS SKIN ABNORMALITY OF YOURS.

2155
01:26:52,909 --> 01:26:55,412
COME ON, HAVE A SEAT.

2156
01:26:55,412 --> 01:26:57,414
UH HUH... HUH.

2157
01:26:57,414 --> 01:26:58,915
UH HUH!

2158
01:26:58,915 --> 01:27:02,419
AS I SUSPECTED, IT'S A KUNDUS.

2159
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,422
WHAT'S A KUNDUS?

2160
01:27:05,422 --> 01:27:06,923
I DON'T KNOW.

2161
01:27:06,923 --> 01:27:08,925
WHAT'S A KUNDUS WITH YOU?

2162
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:14,931
PLEASE, LIE DOWN.

2163
01:27:14,931 --> 01:27:17,934
I'VE GOT A SALVE THAT OUGHT TO SHRINK THAT RIGHT UP.

2164
01:27:17,934 --> 01:27:19,436
WELL...

2165
01:27:19,436 --> 01:27:20,437
I GUESS IT'S WORTH A TRY.

2166
01:27:20,437 --> 01:27:21,438
OH, SURE.

2167
01:27:21,438 --> 01:27:24,441
WE SHOULD SEE RESULTS... WHOA!

2168
01:27:24,441 --> 01:27:26,943
CLEARLY NOT THE WAY TO GO!

2169
01:27:26,943 --> 01:27:28,445
WHAT? WHAT?

2170
01:27:28,445 --> 01:27:30,947
WE APPEAR TO HAVE ANGERED IT.

2171
01:27:31,448 --> 01:27:33,450
WE? WE ANGERED IT?

2172
01:27:33,450 --> 01:27:35,452
OH.

2173
01:27:35,452 --> 01:27:37,454
I THINK I SEE THE PROBLEM...

2174
01:27:37,454 --> 01:27:39,956
AND I'M AFRAID WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO USE

2175
01:27:39,956 --> 01:27:41,958
A MUCH STRONGER TOOL.

2176
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:44,961
LOVE.

2177
01:27:44,961 --> 01:27:47,464
OH, GOD.

2178
01:27:47,464 --> 01:27:49,466
ROSS, OFTEN THESE THINGS ARE NOTHING MORE

2179
01:27:49,466 --> 01:27:52,469
THAN JUST NEGATIVE ENERGY TRYING TO ESCAPE YOUR BODY.

2180
01:27:52,969 --> 01:27:54,971
NOW, THIS IS NOT GOING TO COME OFF

2181
01:27:54,971 --> 01:27:56,973
UNLESS YOU LEARN TO LOVE IT, MY FRIEND.

2182
01:27:57,474 --> 01:28:00,477
SO LET ME HEAR YOU SAY YOU LOVE THE KUNDUS.

2183
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:05,482
I LOVE THE KUNDUS.

2184
01:28:05,482 --> 01:28:07,984
ROSS, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY

2185
01:28:07,984 --> 01:28:09,986
THIS IS GOING TO COME OFF

2186
01:28:09,986 --> 01:28:11,988
UNLESS YOU START TO...

2187
01:28:11,988 --> 01:28:12,989
OW!

2188
01:28:12,989 --> 01:28:14,491
OOPS.

2189
01:28:14,491 --> 01:28:15,492
WHAT WAS... WHAT WAS THAT?

2190
01:28:15,492 --> 01:28:17,994
WELL, IT'S GONE.

2191
01:28:17,994 --> 01:28:19,996
HOW'S THAT?

2192
01:28:19,996 --> 01:28:21,998
GOT CAUGHT IN MY WATCH.

2193
01:28:22,999 --> 01:28:24,501
HEY...

2194
01:28:27,003 --> 01:28:28,505
LIGHTS.

2195
01:28:28,505 --> 01:28:30,006
OOH.

2196
01:28:30,006 --> 01:28:32,008
ROMANTIC LIGHTS.

2197
01:28:32,008 --> 01:28:33,510
OOH, NICE.

2198
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:35,011

2199
01:28:35,011 --> 01:28:38,515
SO, UH, THERE WAS THIS THING I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

2200
01:28:38,515 --> 01:28:40,016
OH, RIGHT.

2201
01:28:40,016 --> 01:28:43,019
I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

2202
01:28:43,019 --> 01:28:44,521
WELL, UH...

2203
01:28:45,021 --> 01:28:47,524
I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF THINKING

2204
01:28:47,524 --> 01:28:49,526
AND I LOOK AT MY LIFE...

2205
01:28:49,526 --> 01:28:52,028
YEAH?

2206
01:28:52,028 --> 01:28:53,530
AND I FEEL LIKE

2207
01:28:53,530 --> 01:28:55,031
I'VE CONQUERED THE BUSINESS WORLD

2208
01:28:55,031 --> 01:28:59,035
AND I FEEL LIKE I'VE CONQUERED THE INTELLECTUAL WORLD

2209
01:28:59,035 --> 01:29:02,539
AND NOW I... I HAVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD.

2210
01:29:02,539 --> 01:29:05,542
WOW.

2211
01:29:05,542 --> 01:29:09,546
BUT THERE'S ONE THING MISSING.

2212
01:29:09,546 --> 01:29:11,047
WHAT'S THAT?

2213
01:29:11,047 --> 01:29:15,552
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO CONQUER THE PHYSICAL WORLD.

2214
01:29:18,054 --> 01:29:20,557
OKAY.

2215
01:29:20,557 --> 01:29:22,058
MONICA...

2216
01:29:22,058 --> 01:29:24,060
I WANT TO BECOME

2217
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:27,564
THE ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPION.

2218
01:29:27,564 --> 01:29:31,067
YOU WANT TO WHAT?

2219
01:29:31,067 --> 01:29:33,570
I WANT TO BECOME THE ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPION.

2220
01:29:33,570 --> 01:29:36,573
IT'S THE MOST INTENSE PHYSICAL COMPETITION IN THE WORLD.

2221
01:29:36,573 --> 01:29:38,074
IT'S BANNED IN 49 STATES.

2222
01:29:38,074 --> 01:29:40,577
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

2223
01:29:40,577 --> 01:29:42,579
MY TRAINER, HO CHI, IS TEACHING ME A COMBINATION

2224
01:29:43,079 --> 01:29:45,081
OF JEET KUNE DO AND BRAZILIAN STREET FIGHTING.

2225
01:29:45,081 --> 01:29:47,584
I EVEN HAD MY OWN OCTAGON TRAINING RING DESIGNED.

2226
01:29:47,584 --> 01:29:51,588
AND I SUPPOSE YOU USED A RING DESIGNER FOR THAT?

2227
01:29:51,588 --> 01:29:54,090
YEAH.

2228
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:57,594
MONICA, I WANT YOU THERE IN THE FRONT ROW WHEN I WIN.

2229
01:29:57,594 --> 01:30:00,597
I WANT YOU CLOSE ENOUGH TO SMELL THE BLOOD.

2230
01:30:01,598 --> 01:30:03,600
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

2231
01:30:05,101 --> 01:30:08,104
MY PARENTS WILL BE SO HAPPY.

2232
01:30:12,609 --> 01:30:15,612
? CRAZY UNDERWEAR, CREEPING UP MY BUTT ?

2233
01:30:17,614 --> 01:30:22,619
? CRAZY UNDERWEAR, ALWAYS IN A RUT ?

2234
01:30:22,619 --> 01:30:24,621
? CRAZY UNDERWEAR... ?

2235
01:30:24,621 --> 01:30:27,123
OH, NO. WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?

2236
01:30:27,123 --> 01:30:29,626
ALL RIGHT, JUST KEEP PLAYING.

2237
01:30:29,626 --> 01:30:31,127
JUST KEEP PLAYING.

2238
01:30:31,127 --> 01:30:32,629
YOU'LL GET THROUGH THIS.

2239
01:30:32,629 --> 01:30:34,130
YOU'LL BE FINE.

2240
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:36,633

2241
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:46,142
OKAY, THANK YOU...

2242
01:30:46,142 --> 01:30:50,647
AND, AS ALWAYS, NO ONE TALK TO ME AFTER THE SHOW.

2243
01:30:53,149 --> 01:30:54,150
HEY.

2244
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:55,652
HEY.

2245
01:30:55,652 --> 01:30:58,154
I WAS PASSING BY AND SAW YOU WERE PLAYING TONIGHT.

2246
01:30:58,154 --> 01:31:00,156
IT'S KIND OF COOL SEEING YOU UP THERE.

2247
01:31:00,156 --> 01:31:01,157
YEAH, WELL...

2248
01:31:01,658 --> 01:31:02,659
WHOA, HEY, HEY, WHOA...

2249
01:31:03,159 --> 01:31:04,160
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

2250
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:05,161
WHO'S THIS GUY?

2251
01:31:05,662 --> 01:31:08,164
I DON'T KNOW. HE JUST STARTED KISSING ME.

2252
01:31:08,164 --> 01:31:10,166
GET HIM! GET HIM, VINCE!

2253
01:31:11,167 --> 01:31:12,168
WHAT?

2254
01:31:12,168 --> 01:31:13,169
WHAT?

2255
01:31:13,169 --> 01:31:14,671
YEAH. OKAY

2256
01:31:14,671 --> 01:31:16,673
I I'VE BEEN DATING BOTH OF YOU

2257
01:31:16,673 --> 01:31:19,676
AND IT'S BEEN REALLY HORRIBLE

2258
01:31:19,676 --> 01:31:20,677
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW

2259
01:31:20,677 --> 01:31:23,179
IT'S BEEN A WHOLE LOT OF FUN FOR ME.

2260
01:31:23,179 --> 01:31:26,182
UM...

2261
01:31:26,182 --> 01:31:27,684
BUT I...

2262
01:31:27,684 --> 01:31:28,685
I LIKE YOU BOTH

2263
01:31:28,685 --> 01:31:30,687
AND I, AND I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO CHOOSE...

2264
01:31:31,187 --> 01:31:32,188
SO I'M SORRY.

2265
01:31:32,188 --> 01:31:33,690
I'M JUST... I'M TERRIBLE.

2266
01:31:33,690 --> 01:31:35,191
I'M A TERRIBLE PERSON.

2267
01:31:35,191 --> 01:31:36,192
I'M TERRIBLE.

2268
01:31:36,192 --> 01:31:37,694
PHOEBE... PHOEBE, RELAX.

2269
01:31:37,694 --> 01:31:39,195
IT'S OKAY. I MEAN...

2270
01:31:39,195 --> 01:31:41,197
WE NEVER SAID THIS WAS EXCLUSIVE.

2271
01:31:41,197 --> 01:31:43,199
YEAH, AND NEITHER DID WE.

2272
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:45,201
GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK.

2273
01:31:45,201 --> 01:31:46,202
REALLY?

2274
01:31:46,202 --> 01:31:48,204
YEAH. I MEAN, YOU KNOW...

2275
01:31:48,204 --> 01:31:50,206
WE HAVEN'T BEEN GOING OUT THAT LONG.

2276
01:31:50,206 --> 01:31:52,709
COME ON, WE HAVEN'T EVEN SLEPT TOGETHER YET.

2277
01:31:52,709 --> 01:31:55,211
YOU HAVEN'T?

2278
01:31:58,214 --> 01:31:59,215
YOU HAVE?

2279
01:31:59,716 --> 01:32:01,718
OKAY, WELL, THIS IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

2280
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:06,222
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

2281
01:32:06,222 --> 01:32:07,724
YOU SLEPT WITH HIM?

2282
01:32:07,724 --> 01:32:09,225
WELL, I MADE YOU

2283
01:32:09,225 --> 01:32:10,727
A CANDLELIGHT DINNER IN THE PARK.

2284
01:32:10,727 --> 01:32:12,228
YOU KNOW, PHOEBE

2285
01:32:12,228 --> 01:32:15,231
I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS REAL EASY FOR YOU.

2286
01:32:19,736 --> 01:32:21,237
WELL...

2287
01:32:21,237 --> 01:32:23,740
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN REALLY AWKWARD.

2288
01:32:25,742 --> 01:32:28,244
YOU MADE HIM A CANDLELIGHT DINNER

2289
01:32:28,244 --> 01:32:29,746
IN THE PARK?

2290
01:32:29,746 --> 01:32:32,248
YEAH, BUT I I CAN DO THAT FOR YOU.

2291
01:32:32,248 --> 01:32:34,250
I'M GOING TO DO THAT FOR YOU.

2292
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:36,252
YEAH. I CAN'T BELIEVE I EVER WENT OUT

2293
01:32:36,252 --> 01:32:38,254
WITH SOMEBODY WHO WOULD ACTUALLY

2294
01:32:38,254 --> 01:32:40,757
HAVE AN OPEN FLAME IN THE MIDDLE OF A WOODED AREA.

2295
01:32:48,765 --> 01:32:51,768
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

2296
01:32:51,768 --> 01:32:53,770
OKAY, DICK?

2297
01:32:56,773 --> 01:32:59,275
HELLO, I AM GURU SAJ.

2298
01:32:59,275 --> 01:33:01,778
WHOA!

2299
01:33:01,778 --> 01:33:04,280
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A DUCK, RIGHT?

2300
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:06,783
BECAUSE, OTHERWISE, THIS IS WAY OUT OF MY LEAGUE.

2301
01:33:06,783 --> 01:33:08,284
YEAH, YEAH.

2302
01:33:08,284 --> 01:33:09,786
HE'S GOT A REALLY BAD COUGH

2303
01:33:09,786 --> 01:33:12,288
AND OUR VET-- HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

2304
01:33:12,288 --> 01:33:14,290
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU CAN DO?

2305
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:15,291
HMM...

2306
01:33:15,291 --> 01:33:16,793
LET ME SEE.

2307
01:33:16,793 --> 01:33:19,295
LET ME SEE.

2308
01:33:19,295 --> 01:33:22,799
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GET HIM TO EAT A BAT?
