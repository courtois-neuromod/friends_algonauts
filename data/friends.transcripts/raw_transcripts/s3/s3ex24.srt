2310
01:33:32,442 --> 01:33:34,444
DO YOU THINK THERE'S A TOWN

2311
01:33:34,444 --> 01:33:36,947
IN MISSOURI OR SOMEPLACE CALLED SAMPLE?

2312
01:33:36,947 --> 01:33:39,449
AND, AS YOU'RE DRIVING INTO TOWN

2313
01:33:39,449 --> 01:33:40,951
THERE'S, LIKE, A SIGN

2314
01:33:40,951 --> 01:33:43,453
AND IT SAYS, "YOU'RE IN SAMPLE"?

2315
01:33:44,454 --> 01:33:45,956
HEY.

2316
01:33:45,956 --> 01:33:47,958
HOW DID IT GO WITH PETE?

2317
01:33:47,958 --> 01:33:48,959
TELL US.

2318
01:33:48,959 --> 01:33:50,961
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS, OKAY?

2319
01:33:50,961 --> 01:33:52,963
SO I GO OVER THERE...

2320
01:33:52,963 --> 01:33:54,464
EXCUSE US.

2321
01:33:54,464 --> 01:33:55,465
I'M SORRY.

2322
01:33:55,465 --> 01:33:56,967
IT'S A LITTLE CROWDED.

2323
01:33:56,967 --> 01:33:58,969
DO YOU MIND IF WE SIT...

2324
01:33:58,969 --> 01:34:00,470
COULD YOU SKOOCH?

2325
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:02,472
MOVE OVER JUST A LITTLE BIT?

2326
01:34:02,472 --> 01:34:03,974
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

2327
01:34:03,974 --> 01:34:05,475
KEEP ON SKOOCHING.

2328
01:34:05,475 --> 01:34:06,977
GRACIAS.

2329
01:34:06,977 --> 01:34:08,478
OKAY, SO...

2330
01:34:08,478 --> 01:34:09,980
SO I GO OVER THERE, AND I'M...

2331
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:12,983
WHAT... WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

2332
01:34:12,983 --> 01:34:14,985
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

2333
01:34:14,985 --> 01:34:16,486
I HAVE A FEELING...

2334
01:34:16,486 --> 01:34:19,990
I... MY WIFE IS SLEEPING WITH HER GYNECOLOGIST.

2335
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:21,491
OH, NO.

2336
01:34:21,491 --> 01:34:22,993
REALLY?

2337
01:34:22,993 --> 01:34:24,995
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

2338
01:34:24,995 --> 01:34:26,496
WELL, YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT ACCESS.

2339
01:34:26,496 --> 01:34:28,498
IT'S A FEELING YOU GET.

2340
01:34:28,498 --> 01:34:31,001
LIKE WHEN YOU GO BOWLING, AND YOU KNOW

2341
01:34:31,001 --> 01:34:33,003
YOU'RE IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S SHOES?

2342
01:34:33,003 --> 01:34:35,005
THAT'S THE ONE.

2343
01:34:35,005 --> 01:34:37,507
SO YOU WENT TO PETE'S AND...

2344
01:34:37,507 --> 01:34:39,009
WHAT HAPPENED?

2345
01:34:39,009 --> 01:34:40,510
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME?

2346
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:42,512
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IT'S MY WOUND.

2347
01:34:42,512 --> 01:34:43,513
FORGET IT.

2348
01:34:43,513 --> 01:34:45,515
YOUR WOUND?

2349
01:34:45,515 --> 01:34:47,017
IT'S NOT HEALED YET?

2350
01:34:47,017 --> 01:34:48,518
NO. IT OOZES.

2351
01:34:48,518 --> 01:34:50,020
COULD YOU PASS THE CREAM?

2352
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:51,521
OH, THERE'S THE CREAM.

2353
01:34:52,022 --> 01:34:53,023
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

2354
01:34:53,023 --> 01:34:55,525
TOMAS, THIS IS GOING TO BE HARD

2355
01:34:55,525 --> 01:34:57,027
BUT I WANTED IT TO COME FROM ME.

2356
01:34:57,027 --> 01:34:58,028
NOBODY ELSE.

2357
01:34:58,028 --> 01:34:59,029
WHAT IS IT?

2358
01:34:59,029 --> 01:35:01,031
IT'S ME-- I'VE BEEN SLEEPING WITH YOUR WIFE.

2359
01:35:01,031 --> 01:35:02,532
SO, YOU'RE THE GYNECOLOGIST?

2360
01:35:02,532 --> 01:35:04,534
HEY, I'M TRYING TO HAVE A PRIVATE CONVERSATION.

2361
01:35:07,037 --> 01:35:09,039
OH, CAN I HAVE A NAPKIN, PLEASE?

2362
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:10,040
PLEASE HAND A...

2363
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:12,542
GIVE ME THE THING, ALL RIGHT?!

2364
01:35:12,542 --> 01:35:15,045
OH, THAT'S IT, ALL RIGHT. ENOUGH!

2365
01:35:15,045 --> 01:35:17,547
AND YOU ARE NO LONGER MY FRIEND!

2366
01:35:17,547 --> 01:35:18,548
WE ARE FINISH!

2367
01:35:18,548 --> 01:35:20,050
NADA! NO MORE!

2368
01:35:20,050 --> 01:35:22,052
YOU ARE A BASTARD FOR DOING THIS!

2369
01:35:22,052 --> 01:35:23,053
GET AWAY FROM ME!

2370
01:35:23,053 --> 01:35:24,554
TOMAS, PLEASE.

2371
01:35:24,554 --> 01:35:25,555
COME BACK HERE.

2372
01:35:33,563 --> 01:35:36,066
SO, MONICA, WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO TELL US?

2373
01:35:37,067 --> 01:35:39,069
I HAVE NO IDEA.

2374
01:35:43,573 --> 01:35:46,076

2375
01:35:46,076 --> 01:35:51,081
?  ?

2376
01:35:51,081 --> 01:35:53,583
?  ?

2377
01:35:53,583 --> 01:35:56,086
?  ?

2378
01:35:56,086 --> 01:35:59,589
?  ?

2379
01:35:59,589 --> 01:36:02,592
?  ?

2380
01:36:02,592 --> 01:36:05,595
?  ?

2381
01:36:06,096 --> 01:36:08,098
?  ?

2382
01:36:08,098 --> 01:36:10,600
?  ?

2383
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:14,604
?  ?

2384
01:36:14,604 --> 01:36:16,606
?  ?

2385
01:36:16,606 --> 01:36:19,609
?  ?

2386
01:36:19,609 --> 01:36:23,613
?  ?

2387
01:36:28,618 --> 01:36:30,120
SO, COME ON, WHAT WAS THE BIG NEWS

2388
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:31,621
PETE WANTED TO TELL YOU, MON?

2389
01:36:31,621 --> 01:36:33,623
OR SHOULD I SAY, MRS. MONICA BECKER?

2390
01:36:33,623 --> 01:36:35,625
NO, NO. OH, KEEP YOUR NAME.

2391
01:36:35,625 --> 01:36:36,626
DON'T TAKE HIS NAME.

2392
01:36:37,127 --> 01:36:39,129
HE DIDN'T ASK ME TO MARRY HIM.

2393
01:36:39,129 --> 01:36:42,132
WELL, THEN,DEFINITELY DON'T TAKE HIS NAME.

2394
01:36:42,132 --> 01:36:45,135
HE WANTED TO TELL ME HE'S GOING TO COMPETE

2395
01:36:45,135 --> 01:36:48,638
IN SOME ULTIMATE FIGHTING COMPETITION THINGY.

2396
01:36:49,139 --> 01:36:50,140
PETE? PETE!

2397
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:51,141
WHY? WHAT IS IT?

2398
01:36:51,141 --> 01:36:52,142
I DON'T KNOW, EXACTLY.

2399
01:36:52,142 --> 01:36:54,144
IT'S SORT OF LIKE WRESTLING.

2400
01:36:54,144 --> 01:36:55,645
OH?

2401
01:36:55,645 --> 01:36:56,646
BUT WITHOUT THE COSTUMES.

2402
01:36:56,646 --> 01:36:58,648
OH.

2403
01:36:58,648 --> 01:36:59,649
AND IT'S NOT FAKE.

2404
01:36:59,649 --> 01:37:01,151
IT'S TOTALLY BRUTAL.

2405
01:37:01,151 --> 01:37:02,652
IT'S TWO GUYS IN THE RING

2406
01:37:02,652 --> 01:37:04,154
AND THE RULES ARE...

2407
01:37:04,154 --> 01:37:05,655
THERE ARE NO RULES.

2408
01:37:05,655 --> 01:37:08,158
I'LL BET YOU MADE A GREAT 12 YEAR OLD.

2409
01:37:08,158 --> 01:37:10,160
OH, IT WAS THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE.

2410
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:11,661
YOU CAN, LIKE, BITE

2411
01:37:11,661 --> 01:37:13,163
AND PULL PEOPLE'S HAIR AND STUFF?

2412
01:37:13,663 --> 01:37:16,166
ANYTHING GOES EXCEPT EYE GOUGING AND FISH HOOKING.

2413
01:37:16,166 --> 01:37:17,667
WHAT'S FISH HOOKING?

2414
01:37:17,667 --> 01:37:19,169
"WHAT'S FISHHOOK...?"

2415
01:37:21,671 --> 01:37:23,173
THANKS, MAN.

2416
01:37:23,173 --> 01:37:25,175
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY HARD TO DESCRIBE.

2417
01:37:25,175 --> 01:37:26,676
WHAT IS THAT TASTE?

2418
01:37:26,676 --> 01:37:29,179
WHAT? MY HANDS ARE TOTALLY CLEAN.

2419
01:37:29,179 --> 01:37:31,181
I JUST GAVE THE DUCK A BATH.

2420
01:37:34,184 --> 01:37:36,686
 SO THANKS FOR THE WARM WELCOME.

2421
01:37:36,686 --> 01:37:38,688
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU GUYS ON MY TEAM.

2422
01:37:38,688 --> 01:37:40,190
I COME TO PLAY.

2423
01:37:40,190 --> 01:37:41,191
I HOPE YOU DO, TOO.

2424
01:37:41,191 --> 01:37:42,692
LET'S GO OUT THERE AND GET THEM.

2425
01:37:42,692 --> 01:37:44,194
AND REMEMBER...

2426
01:37:44,194 --> 01:37:46,696
THERE IS NO "I" IN "TEAM."

2427
01:37:46,696 --> 01:37:48,698
YES, BUT THERE'S TWO IN "MARTINI."

2428
01:37:48,698 --> 01:37:50,700
SO EVERYBODY BACK TO MY OFFICE.

2429
01:37:51,701 --> 01:37:53,203
YOU... CHUCKLES.

2430
01:37:53,203 --> 01:37:55,205
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

2431
01:37:55,205 --> 01:37:56,206
IT'S BING, SIR.

2432
01:37:56,206 --> 01:37:57,207
I'M SORRY. I WAS JUST...

2433
01:37:57,207 --> 01:37:58,208
NO, I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID.

2434
01:37:58,208 --> 01:37:59,709
FUNNY. I LIKE FUNNY.

2435
01:37:59,709 --> 01:38:01,711
THIS TEAM'S ABOUT HARD WORK

2436
01:38:01,711 --> 01:38:04,214
BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT HAVING FUN.

2437
01:38:04,214 --> 01:38:06,216
GOOD TO HAVE YOU ABOARD, BING!

2438
01:38:13,223 --> 01:38:15,225
THAT'S RIGHT. RYDER.

2439
01:38:15,225 --> 01:38:17,727
WINONA RYDER, FOR SIX.

2440
01:38:20,230 --> 01:38:21,731
THANK YOU.

2441
01:38:21,731 --> 01:38:24,234
YEAH, WE HAVE THE RESERVATIONS.

2442
01:38:24,234 --> 01:38:25,735
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

2443
01:38:25,735 --> 01:38:27,237
WAY TO GO!

2444
01:38:29,239 --> 01:38:31,241
DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

2445
01:38:31,241 --> 01:38:33,743
THANK YOU. TODAY, MY BOSS KEPT SLAPPING MY BUTT

2446
01:38:33,743 --> 01:38:36,246
AND HE WAS ACTING LIKE IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

2447
01:38:36,246 --> 01:38:37,747
WHAT DID YOU DO ABOUT IT?

2448
01:38:37,747 --> 01:38:39,249
WELL, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

2449
01:38:39,249 --> 01:38:41,251
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE GUY WHO HAS A PROBLEM

2450
01:38:41,251 --> 01:38:42,752
WITH HIS BOSS SLAPPING HIS BOTTOM.

2451
01:38:43,253 --> 01:38:44,254
I GOT TO TELL YOU

2452
01:38:44,254 --> 01:38:47,257
I THINK IT'S OKAY TO BE THAT GUY.

2453
01:38:48,758 --> 01:38:51,761
YEAH, MAYBE IT'S, LIKE, YOU KNOW, THAT JOCK THING.

2454
01:38:51,761 --> 01:38:53,263
YOU KNOW, HOW FOOTBALL PLAYERS

2455
01:38:53,263 --> 01:38:55,265
PAT EACH OTHER AFTER TOUCHDOWNS.

2456
01:38:55,265 --> 01:38:57,267
YOU KNOW, I DON'T UNDERSTAND GUYS.

2457
01:38:57,267 --> 01:39:00,770
I MEAN, I... I WOULD NEVER CONGRATULATE MONICA

2458
01:39:00,770 --> 01:39:02,772
ON A GREAT STEW

2459
01:39:02,772 --> 01:39:05,275
BY, YOU KNOW, GRABBING HER BOOB.

2460
01:39:05,275 --> 01:39:06,776
YEAH, I KNOW.

2461
01:39:06,776 --> 01:39:08,278
FOR A REALLY GREAT STEW

2462
01:39:08,278 --> 01:39:11,281
YOU JUST STICK YOUR HEAD IN BETWEEN THEM.

2463
01:39:11,281 --> 01:39:14,284
ALL RIGHT, CAN WE PLEASE GO EAT?

2464
01:39:14,284 --> 01:39:15,785
YEAH. WHAT ARE WE GETTING?

2465
01:39:15,785 --> 01:39:17,787
ANYTHING BUT STEW.

2466
01:39:17,787 --> 01:39:19,789
SO, CHANDLER, FROM NOW ON

2467
01:39:19,789 --> 01:39:22,292
DON'T GIVE YOUR BOSS A CHANCE TO GET YOU.

2468
01:39:22,292 --> 01:39:24,294
JUST DON'T TURN YOUR BACK TO HIM.

2469
01:39:24,294 --> 01:39:26,796
OR YOU COULD TEACH HIM  A LESSON, YOU KNOW?

2470
01:39:26,796 --> 01:39:28,798
WHAT YOU COULD DO IS, YOU COULD RUB

2471
01:39:28,798 --> 01:39:30,800
SOMETHING THAT SMELLS REALLY BAD

2472
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,302
ON YOUR BUTT, RIGHT?

2473
01:39:32,302 --> 01:39:34,304
THEN, WHEN HE GOES TO SMACK YOU

2474
01:39:34,304 --> 01:39:35,805
HIS HAND WILL SMELL.

2475
01:39:38,308 --> 01:39:40,810
NOW, WHAT COULD YOU RUB ON YOUR BUTT

2476
01:39:40,810 --> 01:39:42,312
THAT WOULD SMELL BAD?

2477
01:39:44,814 --> 01:39:46,316
WHAT IF JOEY WAS PRESIDENT?

2478
01:39:49,319 --> 01:39:51,821
HEY, RACH, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

2479
01:39:51,821 --> 01:39:53,323
YEAH.

2480
01:39:53,323 --> 01:39:54,324
YOU CAN TOTALLY SAY NO.

2481
01:39:54,324 --> 01:39:56,326
BUT WOULD IT BE OKAY WITH YOU

2482
01:39:56,326 --> 01:39:58,828
IF I SET ROSS UP ON A DATE?

2483
01:39:58,828 --> 01:40:00,330
OH. UH... WITH WHO?

2484
01:40:00,330 --> 01:40:01,831
MY FRIEND BONNIE.

2485
01:40:01,831 --> 01:40:03,833
SHE JUST ALWAYS THOUGHT ROSS WAS REALLY CUTE.

2486
01:40:03,833 --> 01:40:05,835
AND NOW THAT YOU TWO AREN'T TOGETHER

2487
01:40:05,835 --> 01:40:07,337
SHE ASKED IF I COULD SET IT UP.

2488
01:40:07,337 --> 01:40:08,838
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT COOL WITH IT...

2489
01:40:08,838 --> 01:40:10,840
WELL, WHICH ONE IS BONNIE AGAIN?

2490
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:11,841
YOU REMEMBER HER

2491
01:40:11,841 --> 01:40:13,343
FROM MY BIRTHDAY PARTY TWO YEARS AGO?

2492
01:40:13,343 --> 01:40:15,845
SHE'S, LIKE, AVERAGE HEIGHT...

2493
01:40:15,845 --> 01:40:18,348
MEDIUM BUILD... BALD.

2494
01:40:18,348 --> 01:40:19,849
OH.

2495
01:40:21,351 --> 01:40:23,853
THAT'S FINE.

2496
01:40:23,853 --> 01:40:24,854
REALLY?

2497
01:40:24,854 --> 01:40:27,357
COME ON, ROSS AND THE BALD GIRL?

2498
01:40:27,357 --> 01:40:28,358
ABSOLUTELY.

2499
01:40:28,358 --> 01:40:29,859
GREAT! OKAY.

2500
01:40:29,859 --> 01:40:31,361
GOOD FOR YOU.

2501
01:40:31,361 --> 01:40:32,862
ALL RIGHT!

2502
01:40:37,367 --> 01:40:38,868
YOU ARE IRON!

2503
01:40:38,868 --> 01:40:40,870
YOU ARE STEEL!

2504
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:42,372
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

2505
01:40:42,372 --> 01:40:44,874
HOW COME, WHEN I CALL YOUR COMPUTER SUPPORT LINE

2506
01:40:44,874 --> 01:40:46,376
I HAVE TO WAIT AN HOUR AND A HALF?

2507
01:40:46,376 --> 01:40:48,878
I TOLD YOU, WE'RE ADDING NEW OPERATORS ALL THE TIME.

2508
01:40:48,878 --> 01:40:50,880
CAN WE CONCENTRATE ON MY TRAINING?

2509
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:54,884
IT'S JUST HARD WHEN I KNOW I HAVE E MAIL I CAN'T GET!

2510
01:40:56,386 --> 01:40:57,887
HI.

2511
01:40:57,887 --> 01:40:58,888
MONICA.

2512
01:40:58,888 --> 01:40:59,889
HEY.

2513
01:40:59,889 --> 01:41:00,890
HI, HONEY.

2514
01:41:00,890 --> 01:41:02,392
ON THE TABLE.

2515
01:41:02,392 --> 01:41:03,893
ON THE TABLE.

2516
01:41:05,395 --> 01:41:07,897
HEY, UM... SO LISTEN, UM...

2517
01:41:07,897 --> 01:41:09,899
MY FRIENDS WERE TELLING ME

2518
01:41:09,899 --> 01:41:10,900
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

2519
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:12,402
THIS ULTIMATE FIGHTING THING.

2520
01:41:12,402 --> 01:41:13,903
IT SOUNDS REALLY DANGEROUS.

2521
01:41:13,903 --> 01:41:15,905
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET HURT

2522
01:41:15,905 --> 01:41:17,907
BECAUSE I... I KIND OF LIKE YOU.

2523
01:41:17,907 --> 01:41:19,909
BELIEVE ME, I DON'T WANT TO GET HURT, EITHER.

2524
01:41:19,909 --> 01:41:21,411
I'M BEING SMART ABOUT THIS.

2525
01:41:21,411 --> 01:41:22,912
SEE THESE GUYS?

2526
01:41:22,912 --> 01:41:24,914
THEY'RE THE BEST TRAINERS IN THE WORLD.

2527
01:41:25,415 --> 01:41:26,916
HOCHI USED TO BE A PAID ASSASSIN.

2528
01:41:26,916 --> 01:41:28,418

2529
01:41:28,418 --> 01:41:29,919
A HOUSE PAINTER.

2530
01:41:29,919 --> 01:41:31,421
HE USED TO BE

2531
01:41:31,421 --> 01:41:32,922
A HOUSE PAINTER.

2532
01:41:32,922 --> 01:41:35,425
PROMISE ME YOU'LL BE CAREFUL.

2533
01:41:35,425 --> 01:41:36,926
I PROMISE.

2534
01:41:36,926 --> 01:41:38,428
ARE WE STILL ON FOR TONIGHT?

2535
01:41:38,428 --> 01:41:39,929
YEAH. GOOD.

2536
01:41:39,929 --> 01:41:42,432
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE WORKOUT OF OUR OWN.

2537
01:41:42,432 --> 01:41:44,934
NO! NO BOOM BOOM BEFORE BIG FIGHT!

2538
01:41:49,439 --> 01:41:50,940
HOW ABOUT JUST A "BOOM"?

2539
01:41:54,444 --> 01:41:55,945
WOW, THAT WAS DEPRESSING

2540
01:41:55,945 --> 01:41:57,947
I THINK I JUST BOUGHT A SOFT PRETZEL

2541
01:41:57,947 --> 01:41:59,449
FROM ONE OF THE KIDS FROM FAME.

2542
01:41:59,449 --> 01:42:00,950
OH... OH...

2543
01:42:00,950 --> 01:42:02,452
READY TO GO TO THE MOVIES?

2544
01:42:02,452 --> 01:42:04,454
MM HMM. OH, RACH, THIS IS BONNIE.

2545
01:42:04,454 --> 01:42:05,955
HI.

2546
01:42:05,955 --> 01:42:07,457
THIS IS BONNIE?

2547
01:42:07,457 --> 01:42:08,958
THIS IS BONNIE?

2548
01:42:08,958 --> 01:42:09,959
YOU'RE BONNIE?

2549
01:42:09,959 --> 01:42:13,463
I CAN SHOW YOU AN I.D. IF YOU WANT.

2550
01:42:13,463 --> 01:42:14,464
OH, NO. I'M SORRY.

2551
01:42:14,464 --> 01:42:17,467
YOU LOOK A LOT DIFFERENT THAN THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU.

2552
01:42:17,467 --> 01:42:20,470
OH, YEAH. WELL, I JUST STARTED WEARING BRAS AGAIN.

2553
01:42:20,470 --> 01:42:22,972
OH, THAT MUST BE IT.

2554
01:42:22,972 --> 01:42:25,975
WELL, I HOPE YOU HAVE FUN TONIGHT.

2555
01:42:25,975 --> 01:42:27,477
THANKS. YOU, TOO.

2556
01:42:32,982 --> 01:42:34,484
YOU SAID SHE WAS BALD.

2557
01:42:34,984 --> 01:42:35,985
YEAH, SHE WAS BALD.

2558
01:42:35,985 --> 01:42:37,487
SHE'S NOT NOW.

2559
01:42:37,487 --> 01:42:41,491
HOW COULD YOU NOT TELL ME THAT SHE HAS HAIR?

2560
01:42:41,491 --> 01:42:42,492
I DON'T KNOW.

2561
01:42:42,992 --> 01:42:44,994
I HARDLY EVER SAY THAT ABOUT PEOPLE.

2562
01:42:44,994 --> 01:42:46,496
OH, WELL, THIS IS JUST PERFECT!

2563
01:42:46,496 --> 01:42:47,997
WELL, I'M SORRY.

2564
01:42:47,997 --> 01:42:50,500
I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WAS OKAY.

2565
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:52,502
I SAID IT WAS OKAY WHEN I THOUGHT

2566
01:42:52,502 --> 01:42:54,003
SHE WAS SOME WEIRD BALD CHICK.

2567
01:42:54,504 --> 01:42:55,505
I MEAN, YOU KNOW...

2568
01:42:55,505 --> 01:42:57,507
THAT GIRL HAS GOT HAIR ALL OVER HER HEAD.

2569
01:42:57,507 --> 01:42:59,509
WELL, MAYBE IT WON'T WORK OUT.

2570
01:42:59,509 --> 01:43:02,011
MAYBE ROSS WON'T LIKE HER PERSONALITY.

2571
01:43:02,011 --> 01:43:04,514
WHY? DOES SHE HAVE A BAD PERSONALITY?

2572
01:43:04,514 --> 01:43:06,015
OH, NO. BONNIE'S THE BEST.

2573
01:43:11,521 --> 01:43:13,022
BING!

2574
01:43:14,524 --> 01:43:16,526
READ YOUR COMPUTEK PROPOSAL.

2575
01:43:16,526 --> 01:43:18,027
REAL HOME RUN.

2576
01:43:18,027 --> 01:43:19,529
OOH!

2577
01:43:19,529 --> 01:43:21,030
BARELY GOT YOU THAT TIME.

2578
01:43:21,030 --> 01:43:23,032
GET OVER HERE.

2579
01:43:23,032 --> 01:43:24,534
COME ON.

2580
01:43:24,534 --> 01:43:26,536
WHAM! GOOD ONE.

2581
01:43:26,536 --> 01:43:28,037
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.

2582
01:43:28,037 --> 01:43:29,539
KEEP AT IT, TEAM.

2583
01:43:29,539 --> 01:43:30,540
WHAT IS WITH HIM?

2584
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:32,041
WITH HIM?

2585
01:43:32,041 --> 01:43:33,543
YOU'RE HIS FAVORITE.

2586
01:43:33,543 --> 01:43:35,044
YOU'RE HISGUY.

2587
01:43:35,044 --> 01:43:37,046
WE NEVER GET SMACKED.

2588
01:43:37,046 --> 01:43:39,048
WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

2589
01:43:39,048 --> 01:43:40,550
HE SMACKED YOU ONCE.

2590
01:43:40,550 --> 01:43:42,051
NOT ON PURPOSE.

2591
01:43:42,051 --> 01:43:44,053
HE RICOCHETED OFF YOU AND GOT ME.

2592
01:43:44,053 --> 01:43:46,556
I'M TELLING YOU, I NEED SOME SMACKS.

2593
01:43:46,556 --> 01:43:49,559
I GOT A KID STARTING DARTMOUTH IN THE FALL.

2594
01:43:49,559 --> 01:43:51,561
DARTMOUTH? WHO WENT TO DARTMOUTH?

2595
01:43:51,561 --> 01:43:52,562
DARTMOUTH SUCKS.

2596
01:43:52,562 --> 01:43:54,564
YOU GO TO DARTMOUTH, BING?

2597
01:43:54,564 --> 01:43:55,565
NO, SIR.

2598
01:43:55,565 --> 01:43:57,066
THERE YOU GO!

2599
01:44:03,573 --> 01:44:04,574
HEY.

2600
01:44:04,574 --> 01:44:06,075
GOD, ROSS, WHAT IS THAT?

2601
01:44:06,576 --> 01:44:08,578
IT'S THE ULTIMATE FIGHTING COMBO.

2602
01:44:08,578 --> 01:44:09,579
I SAVED 30 CENTS

2603
01:44:09,579 --> 01:44:12,081
PLUS I GET TO KEEP THE CUP. YAY!

2604
01:44:13,583 --> 01:44:16,085
FROM NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK

2605
01:44:16,085 --> 01:44:20,590
APPEARING IN HIS ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP DEBUT...

2606
01:44:20,590 --> 01:44:24,594
HE'S KNOWN FOR HIS CONFRONTATIONAL BUSINESS STYLE!

2607
01:44:24,594 --> 01:44:26,596
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...

2608
01:44:26,596 --> 01:44:31,601
INTRODUCING... PETE... BECKER!

2609
01:44:32,101 --> 01:44:33,603

2610
01:44:33,603 --> 01:44:37,106
HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY!

2611
01:44:37,106 --> 01:44:38,107
I LOVE YOU, PETE!

2612
01:44:38,608 --> 01:44:42,612

2613
01:44:42,612 --> 01:44:47,116
AND HIS OPPONENT, FROM HUNTINGTON BEACH, CALIFORNIA...

2614
01:44:47,116 --> 01:44:49,619
HE'S A 300 POUND

2615
01:44:49,619 --> 01:44:52,121
STREET FIGHTER...

2616
01:44:52,121 --> 01:44:54,123
TANK ABBOTT!

2617
01:44:54,123 --> 01:44:56,626

2618
01:44:56,626 --> 01:45:00,129

2619
01:45:00,129 --> 01:45:02,131
 FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!

2620
01:45:02,131 --> 01:45:04,133
FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!

2621
01:45:04,133 --> 01:45:06,636

2622
01:45:06,636 --> 01:45:08,638
PETE! PETE!

2623
01:45:08,638 --> 01:45:10,139
THAT GUY'S PRETTY HUGE.

2624
01:45:10,139 --> 01:45:11,140
DON'T WORRY.

2625
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:13,142
HOCHI TAUGHT ME HOW TO USE

2626
01:45:13,142 --> 01:45:15,144
AN OPPONENT'S STRENGTH AND WEIGHT AGAINST HIM.

2627
01:45:15,144 --> 01:45:18,648
THEN THAT GUY IS IN SERIOUS, SERIOUS TROUBLE.

2628
01:45:22,652 --> 01:45:24,153
ALL RIGHT, YOU GO GET HIM!

2629
01:45:24,153 --> 01:45:25,655
LET'S GO!

2630
01:45:25,655 --> 01:45:27,657
HERE WE GO, GENTLEMEN.

2631
01:45:27,657 --> 01:45:29,659
HERE WE GO. ARE YOU READY?

2632
01:45:32,662 --> 01:45:34,664
ARE YOU READY?

2633
01:45:34,664 --> 01:45:36,165
LET'S GET IT ON!

2634
01:45:39,168 --> 01:45:40,670
OH!

2635
01:45:42,171 --> 01:45:44,173
UH OH.

2636
01:45:56,185 --> 01:45:58,187
HEY.

2637
01:45:58,187 --> 01:46:00,189
IT'S ME.

2638
01:46:00,189 --> 01:46:03,192
MO NI CA.

2639
01:46:03,192 --> 01:46:05,695
WHO ELSE WOULD YOU BE?

2640
01:46:05,695 --> 01:46:08,197
WELL, EARLIER, WHEN YOU WERE COMING TO

2641
01:46:08,197 --> 01:46:09,198
YOU CALLED ME FRAN.

2642
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:14,203
CAN I JUST TELL YOU HOW PROUD I AM OF YOU?

2643
01:46:14,203 --> 01:46:16,205
IT WOULD BE NICE AFTER HEARING

2644
01:46:16,205 --> 01:46:18,207
20,000 PEOPLE CHANT, "YOU SUCK!"

2645
01:46:18,207 --> 01:46:21,711
I MEAN, I THOUGHT YOU WERE NUTS AT FIRST

2646
01:46:21,711 --> 01:46:23,212
BUT YOU DID IT.

2647
01:46:23,212 --> 01:46:25,715
NOW YOU CAN JUST LOOK BACK AT THIS WHOLE THING

2648
01:46:25,715 --> 01:46:26,716
WITH NO REGRETS.

2649
01:46:26,716 --> 01:46:28,217
LOOK... LOOK BACK?

2650
01:46:28,217 --> 01:46:31,220
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO KEEP GOING, ARE YOU?

2651
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:32,722
WELL, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

2652
01:46:32,722 --> 01:46:35,224
AM I THE ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPION?

2653
01:46:37,226 --> 01:46:39,228
WELL, NO, BUT...

2654
01:46:39,228 --> 01:46:40,229
WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO STOP

2655
01:46:40,229 --> 01:46:42,732
UNTIL I'M THE ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPION.

2656
01:46:42,732 --> 01:46:47,236
THAT GUY STOOD ON YOUR NECK UNTIL YOU PASSED OUT.

2657
01:46:47,236 --> 01:46:49,739
LET ME TELL YOU A STORY.

2658
01:46:49,739 --> 01:46:51,741
WHEN I SET OUT TO CREATE MOSS 865

2659
01:46:51,741 --> 01:46:54,744
DO YOU THINK IT JUST HAPPENED OVERNIGHT?

2660
01:46:54,744 --> 01:46:57,246
NO. THERE WAS MOSS ONE

2661
01:46:57,246 --> 01:46:59,248
THAT BURNED DOWN MY DAD'S GARAGE.

2662
01:46:59,248 --> 01:47:00,750
THERE WAS MOSS TWO

2663
01:47:00,750 --> 01:47:03,753
THAT WOULD ONLY SCHEDULE APPOINTMENTS IN JANUARY

2664
01:47:03,753 --> 01:47:05,755
AND 862 OTHERS THAT I LEARNED FROM

2665
01:47:05,755 --> 01:47:08,257
JUST LIKE I LEARNED FROM THIS FIGHT

2666
01:47:08,257 --> 01:47:10,760
NEVER TO LET A GUY STAND ON MY NECK.

2667
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:13,262
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT ALREADY?

2668
01:47:13,262 --> 01:47:16,766
LOOK, I'M GOING TO GET BETTER.

2669
01:47:16,766 --> 01:47:19,268
OKAY? I PROMISE YOU.

2670
01:47:20,770 --> 01:47:22,271
OKAY.

2671
01:47:22,271 --> 01:47:27,276
JUST... GET A LOT BETTER... FAST.

2672
01:47:28,778 --> 01:47:29,779
OH, ONE OTHER THING--

2673
01:47:30,279 --> 01:47:32,281
HOCHI THINKS THAT YOU BEING RINGSIDE

2674
01:47:32,281 --> 01:47:34,784
MAY HAVE AFFECTED MY CONCENTRATION.

2675
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:36,786
YEAH.

2676
01:47:36,786 --> 01:47:38,788
TH THAT WAS THE PROBLEM.

2677
01:47:44,293 --> 01:47:45,795
HEY. HOW LONG UNTIL PETE'S FIGHT?

2678
01:47:45,795 --> 01:47:47,797
OH, ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.

2679
01:47:47,797 --> 01:47:50,299
RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE INTERVIEWING HIS OPPONENT.

2680
01:47:50,299 --> 01:47:51,801
APPARENTLY, HE TRAINS BY GOING TO IRAN

2681
01:47:51,801 --> 01:47:53,803
AND PULLING THE ARMS OFF THIEVES.

2682
01:47:53,803 --> 01:47:54,804
WOW.

2683
01:47:54,804 --> 01:47:56,305
HOT DOG?

2684
01:47:56,305 --> 01:47:57,807
FOUR, PLEASE.

2685
01:47:57,807 --> 01:47:59,308
I'M REALLY NERVOUS.

2686
01:48:00,810 --> 01:48:02,311
THANK YOU.

2687
01:48:04,313 --> 01:48:07,316
SO, ROSS, HOW, UM... HOW DID IT GO WITH BONNIE?

2688
01:48:07,316 --> 01:48:08,818
OH, I GOT TO TELL YOU.

2689
01:48:08,818 --> 01:48:11,320
I WASN'T EXPECTING TO LIKE HER AT ALL.

2690
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:13,322
I MEAN, I ACTUALLY WASN'T EXPECTING

2691
01:48:13,322 --> 01:48:15,324
TO LIKE ANYONE RIGHT NOW, BUT...

2692
01:48:15,324 --> 01:48:16,325
SHE'S REALLY TERRIFIC.

2693
01:48:16,826 --> 01:48:18,327
OH, IT'S TOO BAD.

2694
01:48:20,329 --> 01:48:23,332
NO, I... I'M SAYING I LIKED HER.

2695
01:48:23,332 --> 01:48:24,333
YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT?

2696
01:48:24,333 --> 01:48:25,334
THERE ARE OTHER FISH IN THE SEA.

2697
01:48:25,334 --> 01:48:28,337
PHEEBS, I THINK SHE'S GREAT, OKAY?

2698
01:48:28,337 --> 01:48:30,339
WE'RE GOING OUT AGAIN.

2699
01:48:30,339 --> 01:48:31,340
OKAY. I HEAR YOU.

2700
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:33,843
ARE YOU CAPABLE OF TALKING

2701
01:48:33,843 --> 01:48:35,344
ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE?

2702
01:48:35,344 --> 01:48:37,346
HEY, WHICH ONE'S MY TURKEY BURGER?

2703
01:48:37,346 --> 01:48:39,849
UH, THE ONE NEXT TO MY FOOT. SORRY.

2704
01:48:39,849 --> 01:48:42,351
HEY, THE FIGHT'S STARTING.

2705
01:48:42,351 --> 01:48:43,853
OKAY. WE'LL BE RIGHT IN.

2706
01:48:43,853 --> 01:48:46,856
SO DID YOUR BOSS TRY TO SLAP YOU AGAIN TODAY?

2707
01:48:46,856 --> 01:48:48,858
NINE TIMES.

2708
01:48:48,858 --> 01:48:50,860
I HAD TO PUT ON LOTION.

2709
01:48:52,862 --> 01:48:54,363
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY

2710
01:48:54,363 --> 01:48:56,866
BECAUSE TOMORROW I'M CONDUCTING AN EXPERIMENT

2711
01:48:56,866 --> 01:48:58,367
AND, IF ALL GOES AS PLANNED

2712
01:48:58,367 --> 01:48:59,869
MY BUTT WILL BE SMACK FREE.

2713
01:48:59,869 --> 01:49:01,871
FIGHT'S OVER.

2714
01:49:06,876 --> 01:49:08,878
EXCUSE ME. DOUG?

2715
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:13,382
HEY, THERE, SPORTS FAN!

2716
01:49:13,382 --> 01:49:16,385
HEY, YOU GOT THOSE NUMBERS FOR ME?

2717
01:49:16,385 --> 01:49:18,387
NO. I, UH... I DIDN'T DO THEM.

2718
01:49:18,387 --> 01:49:20,389
OH? YOU FORGOT?

2719
01:49:20,389 --> 01:49:23,392
NO. NO, I JUST DIDN'T DO THEM.

2720
01:49:23,392 --> 01:49:25,895
INSTEAD, I HUNG OUT WITH SOME FRIENDS

2721
01:49:25,895 --> 01:49:27,897
AND HAD A COUPLE OF BEERS.

2722
01:49:27,897 --> 01:49:30,399
SO I CERTAINLY DON'T DESERVE ANY PRAISE

2723
01:49:30,399 --> 01:49:31,901
VERBAL OR... OTHERWISE.

2724
01:49:31,901 --> 01:49:34,403
WELL, I GOT TANKED MYSELF LAST NIGHT.

2725
01:49:34,403 --> 01:49:35,404
PRETTY DICEY DRIVE HOME.

2726
01:49:35,905 --> 01:49:37,907
TAPPAN ZEE BRIDGE NEVER LOOKED SMALLER.

2727
01:49:37,907 --> 01:49:39,909
THAT'S OKAY.

2728
01:49:40,409 --> 01:49:42,912
YOU'RE STILL MY NUMBER ONE GUY, BING!

2729
01:49:42,912 --> 01:49:43,913
DOUG!

2730
01:49:43,913 --> 01:49:45,414
HMM?

2731
01:49:45,414 --> 01:49:47,416
I'M A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE

2732
01:49:47,416 --> 01:49:50,419
WITH THE WAY THAT YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF.

2733
01:49:50,419 --> 01:49:51,420
IS IT THE SWEARING?

2734
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:53,422
I MEAN, IS IT THE CONSTANT SWEARING?

2735
01:49:53,422 --> 01:49:55,424
BECAUSE, I GOT TO TELL YOU, IF IT IS

2736
01:49:55,424 --> 01:49:56,926
WELL, YOU CAN JUST KISS MY ASS. HUH?

2737
01:49:56,926 --> 01:49:59,929
NO. NO, IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SWEARING.

2738
01:50:00,429 --> 01:50:03,432
IT'S MORE ABOUT, UH... THE WAY THAT YOU

2739
01:50:03,432 --> 01:50:07,436
OCCASIONALLY CONCENTRATE YOUR ENTHUSIASM...

2740
01:50:07,436 --> 01:50:10,940
ON MY BUTTOCKS.

2741
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:12,441
OH.

2742
01:50:12,441 --> 01:50:13,943
OH, AND DON'T GET ME WRONG.

2743
01:50:13,943 --> 01:50:15,444
I APPRECIATE THE SENTIMENT.

2744
01:50:15,444 --> 01:50:18,447
IT'S JUST THAT I... I HAVE A RATHER...

2745
01:50:18,948 --> 01:50:20,449
SENSITIVE POSTERIOR...

2746
01:50:20,449 --> 01:50:22,451
AND, UH, BESIDES

2747
01:50:22,451 --> 01:50:24,954
IT'S MAKING ALL THE OTHER GUYS JEALOUS.

2748
01:50:24,954 --> 01:50:27,456
WELL, SAY NO MORE.

2749
01:50:27,456 --> 01:50:29,959
YOU KNOW, IT TAKES GUTS TO BRING THIS UP.

2750
01:50:29,959 --> 01:50:31,961
BING! YOU'RE OKAY.

2751
01:50:31,961 --> 01:50:32,962
OKAY.

2752
01:50:32,962 --> 01:50:33,963
HA...

2753
01:50:33,963 --> 01:50:35,965
HUH...

2754
01:50:35,965 --> 01:50:37,466
HUH... HUH...

2755
01:50:41,971 --> 01:50:43,973
OKAY, WOULD YOU RATHER LIVE

2756
01:50:43,973 --> 01:50:46,475
IN THE SHIRT POCKET OF A SWEATY GIANT

2757
01:50:46,475 --> 01:50:48,477
OR INSIDE HIS SHOWER DRAIN?

2758
01:50:48,477 --> 01:50:51,480
OH, MY GOD.

2759
01:50:51,480 --> 01:50:53,983
PHOEBE, LOOK. IT'S ROSS AND THAT GIRL.

2760
01:50:57,486 --> 01:50:58,988
OH, NO! LOOK AT THAT!

2761
01:50:58,988 --> 01:50:59,989
IT'S A LINE OF ANTS!

2762
01:51:00,489 --> 01:51:02,491
THEY'RE WORKING AS A TEAM.

2763
01:51:02,491 --> 01:51:04,493
PHOEBE...

2764
01:51:04,493 --> 01:51:05,494
RIGHT. OH, YEAH.

2765
01:51:05,494 --> 01:51:07,496
WOW. OH. IT LOOKS LIKE ROSS

2766
01:51:07,496 --> 01:51:08,497
IS BREAKING UP WITH HER.

2767
01:51:08,497 --> 01:51:10,499
I HOPE HE LETS HER DOWN EASY.

2768
01:51:10,499 --> 01:51:12,001
COME ON, PHOEBE, LOOK AT THAT.

2769
01:51:12,001 --> 01:51:13,002
THEY ARE NOT BREAKING UP.

2770
01:51:13,002 --> 01:51:14,503
LOOK AT THEM. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

2771
01:51:14,503 --> 01:51:16,505
THAT IS A SECOND DATE. THAT'S WHAT THAT IS.

2772
01:51:16,505 --> 01:51:17,506
LOOK AT THAT.

2773
01:51:17,506 --> 01:51:19,508
SHE JUST PUT HER HAND ON HIS THIGH.

2774
01:51:19,508 --> 01:51:21,010
OH, NO, THAT REALLY IS NOTHING.

2775
01:51:21,010 --> 01:51:22,511
SHE'S VERY SEXUALLY AGGRESSIVE.

2776
01:51:22,511 --> 01:51:24,513
PHOEBE, THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

2777
01:51:24,513 --> 01:51:27,016
NOW HE LOVES HER, HE'S GOING TO MARRY HER.

2778
01:51:27,016 --> 01:51:29,018
AND THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

2779
01:51:29,018 --> 01:51:31,020
YOU SAID IT WAS OKAY.

2780
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:33,522
YOU SAID SHE WAS BALD.

2781
01:51:33,522 --> 01:51:37,526
WAS. WAS, WAS, WAS, WAS, WAS.

2782
01:51:37,526 --> 01:51:40,029
PHOEBE, WE JUST CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN, OKAY?

2783
01:51:40,029 --> 01:51:41,030
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

2784
01:51:41,530 --> 01:51:43,032
WE HAVE TO BREAK THEM UP, OKAY?

2785
01:51:43,032 --> 01:51:45,534
JUST GO IN THERE AND, LIKE, SHAVE HER HEAD.

2786
01:51:45,534 --> 01:51:47,036
YOU OWE ME ONE BALD GIRL.

2787
01:51:47,036 --> 01:51:50,539
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, BREATHE.

2788
01:51:50,539 --> 01:51:52,541
SECOND OF ALL, I DON'T GET IT.

2789
01:51:52,541 --> 01:51:57,546
AREN'T YOU THE ONE THAT DECIDED YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE WITH ROSS?

2790
01:51:59,548 --> 01:52:01,050
YES.

2791
01:52:01,050 --> 01:52:02,551
WELL, ISN'T HE YOUR FRIEND?

2792
01:52:02,551 --> 01:52:05,054
DON'T YOU WANT HIM TO BE HAPPY?

2793
01:52:05,054 --> 01:52:08,057
YES.

2794
01:52:08,057 --> 01:52:10,559
SO?

2795
01:52:13,562 --> 01:52:16,065
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T EXPECT HIM

2796
01:52:16,065 --> 01:52:19,068
TO BE THIS HAPPY SO SOON.

2797
01:52:20,569 --> 01:52:22,071

2798
01:52:23,072 --> 01:52:25,074
OH...

2799
01:52:27,076 --> 01:52:28,577
OH, NO.

2800
01:52:28,577 --> 01:52:29,578
WHAT?

2801
01:52:29,578 --> 01:52:31,080
OH, WE KILLED THEM ALL.

2802
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:33,082
OH!

2803
01:52:43,092 --> 01:52:44,593

2804
01:52:44,593 --> 01:52:46,595

2805
01:52:46,595 --> 01:52:47,596
IT'S OKAY.

2806
01:52:47,596 --> 01:52:49,098
IT'S NOT AS BAD AS IT LOOKS.

2807
01:52:49,098 --> 01:52:50,599
IT'S A PRECAUTION.

2808
01:52:50,599 --> 01:52:53,102
UH, I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO MOVE MY SPINE.

2809
01:52:55,104 --> 01:52:57,106
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE STOPPING NOW.

2810
01:52:57,106 --> 01:52:58,607
I'M FINE.

2811
01:52:58,607 --> 01:53:00,609
I'D FIGHT TONIGHT IF THEY'D LET ME.

2812
01:53:00,609 --> 01:53:04,613
NOW, SEE THIS CIRCLE I'M MARKING OFF HERE?

2813
01:53:04,613 --> 01:53:06,615
THIS IS MY ZONE OF TERROR.

2814
01:53:09,618 --> 01:53:11,120
YOU ARE INSANE.

2815
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:13,122
YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE THIS UP.

2816
01:53:13,122 --> 01:53:16,125
I CAN'T UNTIL I'M THE ULTIMATE FIGHTER.

2817
01:53:16,125 --> 01:53:17,126
I WILL DO IT.

2818
01:53:17,126 --> 01:53:19,128
I'M TELLING YOU, THE DAY WILL COME

2819
01:53:19,128 --> 01:53:21,630
WHEN CHILDREN WILL ARGUE OVER WHO WILL WIN A FIGHT--

2820
01:53:21,630 --> 01:53:24,133
ME OR SUPERMAN.

2821
01:53:24,133 --> 01:53:25,634
NOW, I'M NOT SAYING

2822
01:53:26,135 --> 01:53:28,137
I CAN BEAT SUPERMAN, BUT KIDS ARE STUPID.

2823
01:53:28,137 --> 01:53:31,140
HEY... SIT DOWN.

2824
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:33,642
ALL RIGHT, PLE... LISTEN TO ME.

2825
01:53:33,642 --> 01:53:35,644
YOU ARE TERRIBLE AT THIS, OKAY?

2826
01:53:35,644 --> 01:53:38,147
YOU ARE THE WORST ULTIMATE FIGHTER EVER.

2827
01:53:38,147 --> 01:53:40,149
EVER.

2828
01:53:40,149 --> 01:53:42,651
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A TORN ROTATOR CUFF

2829
01:53:43,152 --> 01:53:45,654
A HAIRLINE FRACTURE ON MY RIGHT FOREARM

2830
01:53:45,654 --> 01:53:48,157
AND A SEVERELY BRUISED ADAM'S APPLE

2831
01:53:48,157 --> 01:53:50,159
BUT THAT REALLY HURT.

2832
01:53:55,164 --> 01:53:58,167
WELL, THEN, YOU KNOW WHAT?

2833
01:53:58,167 --> 01:54:00,169
I CARE ABOUT YOU TOO MUCH

2834
01:54:00,169 --> 01:54:03,172
TO WATCH YOU HURT YOURSELF LIKE THIS.

2835
01:54:03,172 --> 01:54:04,673
SO IF YOU HAVE TO DO THIS

2836
01:54:04,673 --> 01:54:08,177
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT WITHOUT ME.

2837
01:54:08,177 --> 01:54:10,679
WELL, IF YOU'RE ASKING ME TO QUIT

2838
01:54:10,679 --> 01:54:13,182
THEN YOU'RE ASKING ME TO BE SOMEONE I'M NOT.

2839
01:54:13,682 --> 01:54:15,684
I'VE GOT TO DO THIS.

2840
01:54:19,188 --> 01:54:21,690
THEN I'VE GOT TO GO.

2841
01:54:23,192 --> 01:54:25,694
BYE.

2842
01:54:29,698 --> 01:54:31,200
MON... MONICA?

2843
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:32,701
YES?

2844
01:54:32,701 --> 01:54:34,203
COULD YOU LEAVE A NOTE?

2845
01:54:34,203 --> 01:54:37,206
BECAUSE I'M ON A LOT OF PAINKILLERS NOW

2846
01:54:37,206 --> 01:54:40,209
AND I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL REMEMBER THIS TOMORROW.

2847
01:54:42,711 --> 01:54:48,717
SO, IN CONCLUSION, THE LINES ALL GO UP, SO I'M HAPPY.

2848
01:54:48,717 --> 01:54:49,718
GREAT JOB, TEAM.

2849
01:54:49,718 --> 01:54:51,220
TOMORROW, 8:30.

2850
01:54:51,220 --> 01:54:52,721
PHIL, NICE JOB.

2851
01:54:52,721 --> 01:54:53,722
STEVENS

2852
01:54:53,722 --> 01:54:55,224
WAY TO GO.

2853
01:54:55,224 --> 01:54:58,727
GOLDBERG, YOU MANIAC, I LOVE YOU!

2854
01:55:00,229 --> 01:55:01,730
BING, GOOD JOB.

2855
01:55:01,730 --> 01:55:03,732
COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU.

2856
01:55:03,732 --> 01:55:04,733
THANK YOU, SIR.

2857
01:55:04,733 --> 01:55:06,735
OH, EXCUSE ME.

2858
01:55:06,735 --> 01:55:08,237
FORGOT MY BRIEFCASE.

2859
01:55:08,737 --> 01:55:10,239
YOU KNOW, BY ACCIDENT.

2860
01:55:10,239 --> 01:55:12,241
OF COURSE YOU DID.

2861
01:55:12,241 --> 01:55:15,744
YOU FORGOT SOMETHING ELSE, TOO, YOU BASTARD!

2862
01:55:15,744 --> 01:55:17,746
WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

2863
01:55:17,746 --> 01:55:19,248
YOU'RE NOT FEELING

2864
01:55:19,248 --> 01:55:20,749
LEFT OUT OR ANYTHING, ARE YOU?

2865
01:55:21,250 --> 01:55:22,751
NO.

2866
01:55:22,751 --> 01:55:23,752
NO. NOT AT ALL.

2867
01:55:24,253 --> 01:55:25,754
THAT... THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

2868
01:55:25,754 --> 01:55:29,258
EVERYBODY ELSE GOT ONE AND YOU WANT ONE, TOO, DON'T YOU?

2869
01:55:29,258 --> 01:55:32,261
YES. YES, I DO.

2870
01:55:33,762 --> 01:55:35,764
NOW, GET ON OUT OF HERE, YOU!

2871
01:55:40,269 --> 01:55:42,771
 Pete Becker is circling the ring now.

2872
01:55:42,771 --> 01:55:44,773
Looks like he's just trying to feel him out.

2873
01:55:44,773 --> 01:55:45,774
Oh, Bruza is charging.

2874
01:55:45,774 --> 01:55:49,778
RUN! RUN, YOU CRAZY, RICH FREAK.

2875
01:55:49,778 --> 01:55:51,280
NO. I CAN'T WATCH THIS.

2876
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:52,781
CHECK IT OUT.

2877
01:55:52,781 --> 01:55:54,783
HE'S WINNING. PETE'S WINNING.

2878
01:55:54,783 --> 01:55:55,284
REALLY?

2879
01:55:55,284 --> 01:55:57,286
NO OH OH.

2880
01:55:57,286 --> 01:56:01,290
Uh-oh. Bruza has Becker on the canvas and is going

2881
01:56:01,290 --> 01:56:02,791
for his favorite area.

2882
01:56:02,791 --> 01:56:05,294
 OH! UH OH!

2883
01:56:05,294 --> 01:56:08,797
IF THAT'S HIS FAVORITE AREA, WHY IS HE BEING SO MEAN TO IT?

2884
01:56:08,797 --> 01:56:09,798
THIS IS IRONIC.

2885
01:56:09,798 --> 01:56:11,300
OF YOUR LAST TWO BOYFRIENDS

2886
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:14,303
RICHARD DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE KIDS

2887
01:56:14,303 --> 01:56:16,305
AND, FROM THE LOOKS OF IT, NOW PETE CAN'T.
