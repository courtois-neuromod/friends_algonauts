1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,006
CAN I SEE THE COMICS?

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,008
THIS IS THE NEW YORK TIMES.

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:12,512
OKAY, MAY I SEE THE COMICS?

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,515
GUYS, I THOUGHT YOU WERE TAKING ROSS TO THE GAME.

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,017
WE ARE. HE'S MEETING US HERE.

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,019
NO. RACHEL IS MEETING US HERE.

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,021
OH, COME ON, THEY CAN BE IN THE SAME ROOM.

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,522
YEAH, YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN THERE LAST NIGHT.

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,024
WHY? WHAT HAPPENED NOW?

10
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,026
ROSS WAS HANGING OUT OVER AT OUR PLACE.

11
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,029
RACHEL COMES OVER TO BORROW SOME MOISTURIZER FROM CHANDLER...

12
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,530
HEY, JOE, WOULD YOU...?

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,033
HOW HARD IS IT TO SAY "SOMETHING"?

14
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,036
"RACHEL CAME OVER TO BORROW... SOMETHING."

15
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,038
ANYWAY, HER AND ROSS

16
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,041
JUST STARTED YELLING AT EACH OTHER.

17
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,542
WAIT, WHY WAS HE YELLING AT HER?

18
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,544
HE'S THE ONE WHO SLEPT WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

19
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,545
WELL, I GUESS HE SAYS

20
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,547
THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE ON A BREAK WHEN IT HAPPENED

21
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,049
THAT SHE SHOULD'VE FORGIVEN HIM BY NOW.

22
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,051
WHOA! HE IS SO UNREASONABLE.

23
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,052
GOD!

24
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,554
ALTHOUGH I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANS.

25
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,556
OH, MY GOD.

26
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,058
THIS IS LIKE60 MINUTES...

27
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,060
OKAY, WHEN AT FIRST YOU'RE REALLY MAD

28
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,063
AT THAT PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FOR MAKING THE DRUG

29
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,066
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, YOU JUST FEEL BAD FOR THE PEOPLE

30
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,568
BECAUSE THEY NEEDED TO MAKE THEIR HAIR GROW.

31
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,070
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS LIKE?

32
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,572
THIS IS LIKE WHEN MY PARENTS GOT DIVORCED.

33
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:16,076
MAN, I HOPE ROSS DOESN'T TRY TO KIDNAP ME AFTER CUB SCOUTS.

34
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,077
YOU KNOW, I HAD A DREAM

35
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,579
THAT ROSS AND RACHEL WERE STILL TOGETHER.

36
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,580
THEY NEVER BROKE UP

37
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,083
AND WE WERE ALL JUST, LIKE, HANGING OUT

38
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,084
AND EVERYONE WAS HAPPY.

39
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,585
I HAD THE SAME DREAM.

40
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,587
AND NOBODY SLEPT WITH THAT XEROX GIRL.

41
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,589
OH. I HAD THE OPPOSITE DREAM.

42
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,590
YOU KNOW WHAT?

43
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,092
MAYBE IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

44
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,593
I MEAN, IT'S BEEN A WEEK.

45
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,096
YEAH. IT'S NEVER TAKEN ME MORE THAN A WEEK

46
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,597
TO GET OVER A RELATIONSHIP.

47
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:41,101
IT'S NEVER TAKEN YOU MORE THAN A SHOWER TO GET OVER

48
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,103
A RELATIONSHIP.

49
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,104
OKAY, LET'S GO.

50
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,605
LET'S HIT THE ROAD.

51
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,607
LET'S GET THE SHOW ON IT.

52
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,608
LET ME GET A CUP OF COFFEE.

53
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,111
I KNOW THE BEST COFFEEHOUSE, AND IT'S SO CLOSE.

54
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,612
CLOSER THAN HERE?

55
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,614
HEY, LOOK, LOOK-- I FOUND COFFEE.

56
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,616
OKAY, LET'S SKEDADDLE.

57
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,618
PHEEBS, I'M NOT GOING TO DRINK

58
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,120
SOMEBODY'S OLD COFFEE.

59
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,621
OKAY... YOUR HIGHNESS.

60
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,131
"RACHEL, I'M REALLY SORRY."

61
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,632
"UM, THAT'S OKAY, ROSS.

62
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,134
YOU WANT TO GET BACK TOGETHER?"

63
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,135
"YEAH, OKAY."

64
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,137
DID ANYONE ELSE HEAR THAT?

65
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:24,644

66
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:29,649
?  ?

67
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,152
?  ?

68
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,654
?  ?

69
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:39,659
?  ?

70
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,161
?  ?

71
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,164
?  ?

72
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:48,168
?  ?

73
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,170
?  ?

74
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,173
?  ?

75
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,175
?  ?

76
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,677
?  ?

77
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:04,684
?  ?

78
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,694

79
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,197
IS HE HERE?

80
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,198
NO.

81
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,700
OH. HERE'S YOUR MOISTURIZER.

82
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,203
HI.

83
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,204
HEY.

84
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,705
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO LOVE ME.

85
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,207
OKAY, CHECK IT OUT--

86
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,208
THURSDAY NIGHT

87
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,209
FIVE TICKETS.

88
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,211
CALVIN KLEIN LINGERIE SHOW

89
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,713
AND YOU GUYS ARE COMING WITH ME.

90
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,718
OKAY, I SAID THAT OUT LOUD, RIGHT?

91
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,720
YES. YES. IT'S JUST THAT WE...

92
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,224
WE KIND OF ALREADY... MADE PLANS WITH ROSS.

93
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,727
OH.

94
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,229
WELL, OKAY.

95
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,230
WELL, THERE YOU GO.

96
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,731
 NO. IT'S JUST

97
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,234
THAT HE GOT THIS NEW, LIKE, HOME THEATER DEALY

98
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,735
AND HE WANTS US TO CHECK IT OUT.

99
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,238
YEAH. HE'S REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT, TOO.

100
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,241
EVEN RECORDED SHOW TIMES ON HIS ANSWERING MACHINE.

101
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,742
WE'RE SORRY, HONEY.

102
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,743
OH, IT'S OKAY.

103
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,745
RACH, IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO.

104
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,247
REALLY.

105
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,750
ARE WE TALKING MODELS IN THEIR UNDERWEAR?

106
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,252
AND HEELS.

107
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,759
ROSS DID ASK US FIRST, AND WE SET THAT NIGHT ASIDE.

108
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,261
NO. HEY, COME ON, YOU KNOW.

109
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,263
IF HE ASKED YOU FIRST, THAT'S ONLY FAIR.

110
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,766

111
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,268
 OH, BOY, DO I FEEL BAD.

112
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,769
OH, YEAH.

113
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,271
 VERY BAD.

114
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,273
CHANDLER! CHANDLER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

115
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,776
OH, MY GOD!

116
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,278
YOU'RE SMOKING AGAIN?

117
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,780
WELL, ACTUALLY, YESTERDAY I WAS SMOKING AGAIN.

118
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,782
TODAY, I'M... I'M SMOKING STILL.

119
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,784
BUT WHY WOULD YOU START AGAIN

120
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,287
AFTER CHEWING ALL THAT QUITTING GUM?

121
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,290
LOOK, I'M TELLING YOU, THIS IS JUST LIKE MY PARENTS' DIVORCE

122
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,792
WHICH IS WHEN I STARTED SMOKING IN THE FIRST PLACE.

123
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,795
WEREN'T YOU NINE?

124
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,298
YEAH.

125
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,302
I'M TELLING YOU SOMETHING--

126
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,804
THAT FIRST SMOKE AFTER NAP TIME...

127
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,805

128
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,806
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

129
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,309
WITH MY LUCK, THAT'S GOING TO BE HIM.

130
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,311
HIM? HIM, ROSS?

131
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,313
NO. HIM 253.

132
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,814
HIS EYES ARE ON THE SPARROW.

133
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,318
WHEN MY PARENTS GOT DIVORCED

134
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,821
IS WHEN I STARTED USING HUMOR AS A DEFENSE MECHANISM.

135
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,826
HI. UH, DO YOU GUYS HAVE PLANS FOR THE WEEKEND

136
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,828
BECAUSE I HAVE MY SISTER ON HOLD

137
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,330
AND SHE SAID THAT WE COULD

138
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,332
HAVE HER CABIN FOR THE WEEKEND

139
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,333
AND GO SKIING.

140
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,835
HUH? I'M ASKING YOU FIRST, RIGHT?

141
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,837
I MEAN, I'M PLAYING BY THE RULES.

142
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,838
YEAH.

143
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,839
CHANDLER!

144
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,840
YOU'RE SMOKING?

145
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,841
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

146
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,344
HEY, SHUT UP! YOU'RE NOT MY REAL MOM.

147
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,352
HEY, CAN YOU CLOSE THAT WINDOW, CHANDLER?

148
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,354
MY NIPPLES COULD CUT GLASS OVER HERE.

149
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,358
WAIT, REALLY?

150
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,360
BECAUSE MINE GET ME OUT OF TICKETS.

151
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,864
LOOK, YOU GUYS, I JUST WANT TO SAY

152
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,368
I REALLY, REALLY APPRECIATE YOU SPENDING THIS TIME WITH ME.

153
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,870
IT'S BEEN A PRETTY HARD TIME RIGHT NOW

154
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,372
SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANKS.

155
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,873
CAN SOMEBODY ELSE HUG HIM?

156
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,874
I HAVE TO STAY

157
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,376
BY THE WINDOW.

158
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,379
OH, HEY, HEY, HUH?

159
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,383
HOW ABOUT THIS WEEKEND WE HAVE A LASER DISK MARATHON

160
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,386
AND MAYBE A TOURNAMENT ON MY NEW...

161
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,887
DART BOARD. HUH? HUH?

162
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,389
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

163
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,391
TWO DAYS OF DARTS.

164
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,892
IT'LL BE GREAT.

165
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,895
IT'LL BE GREAT FOR NEXT WEEKEND.

166
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,897
NO, NO, NO. THIS WEEKEND, GUYS.

167
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,899
IT'LL BE GREAT FOR NEXT WEEKEND.

168
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:40,900
I MEAN...

169
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,902
IT'LL BE GREAT.

170
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,407
WHAT'S GOING ON?

171
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,408
WE WERE, UM...

172
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,410
SORT OF INVITED TO GO SKIING.

173
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,412
YOU KNOW, RACHEL'S SISTER'S CABIN.

174
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,917
SO... FOR THE WHOLE WEEKEND?

175
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,420
WE'RE REALLY SORRY

176
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,422
BUT, UM... SHE DID ASK US FIRST.

177
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,424
YEAH, THAT'S OKAY.

178
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,426
I MEAN, IF YOU GUYS ALL HAVE TO GO AWAY

179
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,429
FOR THE FIRST WEEKEND I'M ALONE BY MYSELF, YOU KNOW...

180
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,432
I TOTALLY, TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

181
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,933
YOU KNOW WHAT? I COULD STAY.

182
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,934
I'M GOING TO STAY.

183
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,936
BECAUSE THE LAST TIME I WENT SKIING

184
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,439
I WAS TOO AFRAID TO JUMP OFF THE CHAIRLIFT.

185
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,940
I JUST WENT ROUND AND ROUND.

186
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,442
PHEEBS, WE KIND OF NEED YOU

187
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,943
TO DRIVE EVERYBODY UP THERE

188
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,445
IN YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S CAB

189
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,447
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL STAY.

190
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,448
NO, I'LL STAY.

191
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,949
HE'S MY BROTHER.

192
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,451
WHAT, A PITY STAY?

193
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,952
NO.

194
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,954
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FUN.

195
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,957
WE CAN MAKE FUDGE.

196
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,960
PITY FOOD?

197
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,961
YOU KNOW WHAT?

198
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,463
THAT'S OKAY, ALL RIGHT?

199
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,465
I DON'T NEED ANY OF YOU TO STAY, OKAY?

200
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,966
NOBODY STAYS.

201
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,469
WELL, THEN, I MIGHT AS WELL OFFER TO STAY.

202
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,477
HEY...

203
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,479
DOES ANYBODY ELSE FEEL BAD ABOUT ROSS?

204
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,981
WHY? DO YOU THINK HE'S STILL MAD AT US?

205
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,483
HE'S PROBABLY MORE MAD

206
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,984
SINCE YOU CALLED HIM THIS MORNING

207
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,486
TO BORROW HIS GOGGLES.

208
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,488
WHAT? MINE AREN'T TINTED.

209
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,992
CHANDLER?

210
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,993
WHAT?

211
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,496
WHAT DOES THE SIGN SAY?

212
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,499
"BEAM ME UP, JESUS."

213
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,502
NO. THE "NO SMOKING" SIGN.

214
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,004
THERE'S NO SMOKING IN MY GRANDMOTHER'S CAB.

215
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:29,008
OKAY, WELL, THEN I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

216
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,512
NO. NO. NO UNSCHEDULED STOPS.

217
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,013
YOU CAN GO WHEN WE STOP FOR GAS.

218
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,516
COME ON. THERE'S A REST STOP RIGHT UP THERE.

219
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,018
COME ON, I REALLY HAVE TO GO.

220
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,522
OH, NOW I HAVE TO GO!

221
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,526
IS THAT ALL THAT IT TAKES?

222
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,028
SOMETIMES JUST A SMALL BREEZE.

223
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,537
 HERE WE GO.

224
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,038
OKAY, BRACE YOURSELVES.

225
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,039
WHAT?

226
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,040
OH!

227
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,542
OKAY.

228
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,543
OW!

229
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,049
AREN'T YOU GOING TO GO?

230
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,551
NO. THANK YOU.

231
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,053
NO, RACHEL NEVER PEES IN PUBLIC REST ROOMS.

232
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,557
WELL, THEY NEVER HAVE ANY PAPER IN THERE, YOU KNOW

233
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,059
SO MY RULE IS, NO TISSUE, NO TUSHY.

234
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,068
WELL, IF EVERYBODY'S GOING...

235
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,070
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT, DON'T CLOSE IT!

236
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,071
THE KEYS ARE IN THERE!

237
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,073
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO!

238
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,076
MY LIGHTER'S IN THERE!

239
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,086
DAMN! THE TAILPIPE'S NOT HOT ENOUGH TO LIGHT THIS.

240
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,088
RELAX, OKAY?

241
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,089
I CAN GET THIS OPEN.

242
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,591
ANYBODY GOT A COAT HANGER?

243
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,092
OH, I DO.

244
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,594
OH. NO, WAIT A MINUTE.

245
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,596
I TOOK IT OUT OF MY SHIRT

246
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,097
WHEN I PUT IT ON THIS MORNING.

247
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,600
SO, IF YOUR PARENTS HADN'T GOT DIVORCED

248
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,602
YOU'D BE ABLE TO ANSWER A QUESTION

249
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,604
LIKE A NORMAL PERSON?

250
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,106

00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,609

254
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,114
COME ON, WHO HAS THE BIGGEST BOOBS?

255
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,617

256
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,120
WHOEVER HAS THE BIGGEST BOOBS HAS THE BIGGEST BRA

257
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,122
THEREFORE HAS THE BIGGEST WIRE.

258
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,625
IF YOU WANT TO GET BACK IN THE CAR

259
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,626
WE NEED THAT WIRE.

260
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,128

261
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,633
OKAY, MONICA'S ARE THE BIGGEST.

263
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,638
PLEASE.

264
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,139
IT'S GOT TO BE RACHEL.

265
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,140
NO, NO, NO.

266
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,643
MINE ARE DECEPTIVELY SMALL.

267
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,146
I MEAN, I ACTUALLY SOMETIMES STUFF MY BRA.

268
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,150
OKAY, WELL, THEN YOUR BRA WOULD STILL BE BIG.

269
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,153
NO, I STUFF... OUTSIDE THE BRA.

270
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,656
LADIES, LADIES, LET'S JUST COMPROMISE, OKAY?

YOU CAN HAVE MINE.

274
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,164
THANK YOU.

275
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,168
CHANDLER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

276
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,170
THERE IS A TRASH CAN RIGHT THERE.

277
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,672
WELL, I THOUGHT IF I LITTERED

278
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,676

279
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,678
OKAY, THERE.

280
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,680
THANK YOU, PHOEBE.

281
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,682

282
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,183
GENEROUS.

283
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,687
WOW, THIS IS NICE.

284
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,191

00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,193
OKAY, NOW LET'S DECIDE WHO HAS THE NICEST ASS.

00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,728
YEP. PUT MORE GAS IN.

297
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,234

298
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,738
HI. HI.

299
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,239
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

300
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,241
OH, JUST... I WAS JUST WONDERING.

301
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,244
WHEN YOU AND I SPLIT UP, DID YOU GET THE TAPE

302
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,246
THAT WAS HALF THE LAST EPISODE OF M.A.S.H.

303
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,248
AND HALF THE HOSTAGES COMING HOME?

304
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,251
UH, YEAH, BUT NOW IT'S SUSAN AND ME IN MEXICO

305
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,253

308
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,257
AH...

309
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,258
OOH...

00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,260

311
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,261
UH, YEAH, ACTUALLY.

312
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,764
SUSAN'S GOING TO BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

313
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,766
IT'S KIND OF AN ANNIVERSARY.

314
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,769
OH... I THOUGHT YOU GUYS GOT MARRIED IN JANUARY.

315
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,771
DIFFERENT KIND OF ANNIVERSARY.

316
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,773
OH...

317
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,774
OH.

318
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,777
SO, ANYWAY...

319
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,279
CANDLES, CHAMPAGNE...

320
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,281
ANNIVERSARIES ARE GREAT.

321
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,282

322
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,285
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, LOVE LASTS FOREVER, YOU KNOW?

323
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,788
NOTHING LIKE IT IN THIS LIFETIME.

324
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,289
MONEY IN THE BANK.

325
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,291
SO, RACHEL AND I BROKE UP.

326
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,294
OH, GOD, ROSS, I AM SO SORRY.

327
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,295
YEAH.

328
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,797
YOU KNOW WHAT?

329
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,799
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS SO MUCH

330
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,300
BUT WE SHOULD PROBABLY DO IT

331
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,802
WHEN WE CAN REALLY GET INTO IT.

332
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,804
YOU FREE FOR DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT?

333
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,805
OH, YEAH, I'D LOVE THAT.

334
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,306
ME, TOO.

335
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,808
I GUESS IT ALL STARTED

336
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,310
WHEN RACHEL GOT THIS NEW JOB.

337
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,314
OKAY, YEAH. TRIPLE A CAN PICK US UP.

338
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,315
OH, GOOD.

339
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,817
WHAT TOWN ARE WE NEAR?

340
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,818
UM... FREMONT.

341
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,819
WESTMONT...

342
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,821
UM... WESTBURG?

343
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,823
OKAY, WHY ARE YOU ANSWERING?

344
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,325
DO YOU KNOW AT LEAST WHAT ROUTE WE'RE ON?

345
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,828
WE ARE DEFINITELY ON ROUTE 27.

346
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:49,829
OKAY.

347
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,832
WE ARE AT A REST STOP ON ROUTE 27...

348
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,834
OKAY. THERE IS NO ROUTE 27.

349
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,335
OKAY, EITHER 93 OR 76.

350
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,837
I DON'T KNOW.

351
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,339
I'M SORRY, I ALWAYS SLEPT IN THE BACK WHEN WE DROVE UP HERE.

352
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:04,343
HEY, CAN YOU JUST SEND SOMEONE UP AND DOWN THE 76

353
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,846
AND JUST CHECK EVERY REST STOP?

354
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,347
AND... AND ALSO 93?

355
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,850
OKAY.

356
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,351
YEAH. NO, THEY DON'T DO THAT.

357
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,356
OKAY, WELL, SOMEBODY WILL COME AND SAVE US.

358
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,858
WHO?

359
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,359
I MEAN, HAVE YOU SEEN A CAR COME BY

360
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,861
IN THE LAST HOUR AND A HALF?

361
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,862
I THINK WE SHOULD CALL ROSS.

362
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,363
MAYBE HE CAN GET A CAR TO PICK US UP.

363
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,364
NO.

364
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,867
NO, I AM NOT GETTING IN A CAR WITH ROSS.

365
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,869
WE WILL JUST HAVE TO...

366
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,870
LIVE HERE.

367
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,371
COME ON, IT'S SO COLD...

368
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,873
NO, YOU GUYS.

369
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,374
I AM NOT GETTING IN A CAR WITH HIM.

370
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,375
YOU'LL HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE.

371
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,878
OH, GOOD, JOEY AND CHANDLER ARE BACK.

372
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,884
 SO THE GOING FOR HELP WENT WELL.

373
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,885
SMOKEY JOE HERE

374
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,387
GOT HALFWAY TO THE HIGHWAY AND COLLAPSED.

375
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,390
I HAVE THE LUNG CAPACITY OF A TWO YEAR OLD.

376
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,392
THEN WHY ARE YOU SMOKING?

377
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,394
WELL, IT'S VERY UNSETTLING.

378
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,398
RIGHT? RIGHT?

379
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,901
I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY UNBELIEVABLE, YOU KNOW?

380
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,402
THEY JUST TOOK OFF...

381
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,404
TOOK OFF WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING BACK.

382
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,406
YOU KNOW, I DON'T... I DON'T NEED THEM.

383
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,909
I'VE GOT YOU GUYS NOW AS FRIENDS--

384
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:10,910
YOU AND SUSAN.

385
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,913
AH, SUSAN WILL BE SO PLEASED.

386
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,414

387
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,916

388
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,419
WHERE'S SEVEN ONE SEVEN?

389
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,421
OKAY, YOU HAVE MORE OF THESE

390
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,422
FOR SUSAN, RIGHT?

391
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,924
NO, BUT THAT'S OKAY.

392
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,928
I'LL JUST PUT OUT PICKLES OR SOMETHING.

393
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,431

394
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,432
ROSS. THANK GOD.

395
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,433
Pheebs?

396
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,435
WHY ARE YOU WHISPERING?

397
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,938
I... ATE A BUG.

398
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,439
HEY, RACH...

399
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,441
THE TAMPONS HERE ARE ONLY A PENNY.

400
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,444
LET'S STOCK UP.

401
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,447
LISTEN, ROSS, WE RAN OUT OF GAS AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE

402
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,949
SO WE CAN'T GET A TOW TRUCK.

403
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,952
OH. NOW YOU WANT A FAVOR.

404
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,953
YES, PLEASE.

405
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,454
WELL, I'M SORRY YOUR CAR

406
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,455
BROKE DOWN, PHEEBS

407
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,957
BUT I'M A LITTLE TOO BUSY

408
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,959
WITH SOME OF MY REAL FRIENDS RIGHT NOW

409
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,460
BUT PLEASE CALL

410
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,462
TO LET ME KNOW YOU GOT HOME SAFELY.

411
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,463
PHOEBE, HANG ON A SECOND.

412
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:05,464
HERE. TAKE MY CAR

413
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,966
GO PICK UP YOUR FRIENDS.

414
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,967
NO, I AM NOT GOING...

415
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,969
LISTEN, WE BOTH KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT

416
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,470
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A JERK, OKAY?

417
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,973
SO YOU CAN EITHER SULK HERE FOR HALF AN HOUR

418
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,474
AND THEN GO PICK THEM UP

419
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,976
OR YOU CAN SAVE US BOTH TIME

420
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:17,977
AND SULK IN THE CAR.

421
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,478
NO. RACHEL DOESN'T WANT ME...

422
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,980
I AM SORRY THAT RACHEL DUMPED YOU

423
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,982
BECAUSE SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH THAT MARK GUY

424
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,484
AND YOU ARE THE INNOCENT VICTIM IN ALL OF THIS

425
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,986
BUT DON'T PUNISH YOUR FRIENDS

426
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,988
FOR WHAT RACHEL DID TO YOU.

427
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:29,989
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

428
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,490
PHOEBE, HANG ON A SECOND.

429
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,993
ROSS WANTS TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

430
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:34,994
WHAT?

431
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,495
YOU SLEPT WITH SOMEONE ELSE?

432
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,999
WE WERE ON A BREAK!

433
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,002
WE WERE... WE...

434
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,504
WHERE ARE YOU?

435
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,006
I'LL FIND YOU.

436
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,507
YOU SLEPT WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

437
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,510
OH, Y YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

438
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,516
OKAY, DONE.

439
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,020
WHAT'S "PLEH?"

440
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,522
THAT'S "HELP" SPELLED BACKWARDS

441
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:08,027
SO THAT THE HELICOPTERS CAN READ IT FROM THE AIR.

442
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,528
AH...

443
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,530
WHAT'S "DOOFUS" SPELLED BACKWARDS?

444
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,035
OH! OH! CAR! CAR!

445
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,038
OHH...

446
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,041
IT'S ROSS ON ONE OF HIS DRIVES!

447
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,043
HEY, HEY!

448
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,045
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?

449
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,546
HE IS SAVING YOUR BUTT.

450
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,049
UNLESS, OF COURSE, I'M STEPPING ON SOME TOES HERE

451
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,051
IN WHICH CASE I CAN JUST MOSEY ON.

452
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,054
I'VE GOT PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP ON THE INTERSTATE.

453
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,057

454
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,559
FINE. FINE.

455
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,563
OH, NO.

456
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,067
NOW IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY SENSE.

457
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,068
YOU GUYS...

458
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,569
WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT ROSS?

459
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,071
HE DROVE ALL THE WAY UP HERE.

460
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,072
WHAT DO WE DO?

461
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,573
JUST, LIKE, SEND HIM BACK

462
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,575
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO SKIING.

463
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,576
OH, THIS IS HORRIBLE.

464
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,078
IT'S JUST HORRIBLE.

465
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,079
YOU GUYS THINK...

466
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,581
YOU THINK WE SHOULD ASK ROSS TO COME ALONG?

467
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,582
BUT WHAT ABOUT RACHEL?

468
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,085
I MEAN, HOW ARE WE GOING TO EVEN ASK HER?

469
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,087
ASK ME WHAT?

470
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:13,092
UM... IF, UH, IT MIGHT BE OKAY IF ROSS CAME SKIING.

471
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,093
I WASN'T...

472
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,095
OH, NO, I WASN'T GOING TO ASK THAT.

473
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,097
I WASN'T GOING TO ASK THAT AT ALL.

474
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,598
YOU GUYS ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

475
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,100
NO, HE CANNOT COME.

476
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,101
EXCUSE ME?

477
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,103
"IT'S HORRIBLE."

478
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,606
OH, PLEASE, CAN'T I COME TO YOUR SPECIAL, MAGICAL CABIN?

479
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,609
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN WANT TO COME, ROSS?

480
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,111
YOU'RE A HORRIBLE SKIER.

481
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:36,115
OH, OH... HITTING ME WHERE IT HURTS-- MY SKI SKILLS.

482
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,117
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

483
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,618
I CAN'T HANDLE THIS, YOU GUYS.

484
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,120
YOU KNOW, I CAN HANDLE IT.

485
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,621
"HANDLE" IS MY MIDDLE NAME.

486
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:47,626
ACTUALLY, IT'S THE... MIDDLE PART OF MY FIRST NAME.

487
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,128
ALL RIGHT, PHEEBS.

488
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,129
THE CAB'S READY.

489
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,130
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

490
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,631
YOU'RE WELCOME.

491
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,632
OH, I'M SORRY.

492
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,634
WERE YOU SPEAKING TO ME

493
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,636
OR SLEEPING WITH SOMEONE ELSE?

494
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,638
WE WERE ON A BREAK.

495
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,640
YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T YOU JUST PUTTHAT

496
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,142
ON YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE?

497
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,643
HEY, IT'S VALID, OKAY?

498
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,645
AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS SO.

499
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,646
MONICA AGREES WITH ME.

500
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,648
WHAT?

501
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,152
I DON'T KNOW.

502
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,653
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID LAST NIGHT.

503
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,656
WHAT I SAID WAS... WAS THAT I UNDERSTOOD.

504
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,159
JOEY IS THE ONE WHO AGREED WITH YOU.

505
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,160
OKAY.

506
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,162
REALLY, JOEY?

507
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,165
WHAT?

508
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,166
YOU KNOW WHAT?

509
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,169
THERE IS NO RIGHT OR WRONG HERE.

510
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,671
NO, I THINK IT'S VERY OBVIOUS WHO'S WRONG HERE.

511
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,673
OBVIOUSLY NOT TO JOEY.

512
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,178
WHAT?

513
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,680

514
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,685
HEY, GUESS WHO I AM!

515
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,691

516
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,194
HEY, HEY, HEY!

517
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,695
HEY!

518
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,698
LOOK WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO CHANDLER!

519
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,702
YEAH, LOOK, WE KNOW THAT THIS

520
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,705
IS REALLY, REALLY HARD FOR YOU GUYS, OKAY?

521
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,207
YOU DON'T...

522
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,709
ALL RIGHT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOVE EACH OTHER, OKAY?

523
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,212
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO LIKE EACH OTHER MUCH RIGHT NOW

524
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,214
BUT... PLEASE, YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

525
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,715
TO BE AROUND EACH OTHER.

526
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,718
YEAH, AND NOT PUT US IN THE MIDDLE.

527
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,719
YEAH. OTHERWISE...

528
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,221
I MEAN, THAT'S JUST...

529
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,723
THAT'S IT FOR US HANGING OUT TOGETHER.

530
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,724
YOU KNOW?

531
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,226
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

532
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,730
CAN YOU BE CIVIL?

533
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,731
YEAH.

534
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,233
I CAN.

535
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,734
 OKAY.

536
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,735
GOOD.

537
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,737
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET BACK IN THE CAR

538
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,240
BECAUSE IT'S FREEZING AND MY CHEST IS UNSUPPORTED.

539
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,741
UH, W WAIT A SECOND.

540
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,743
I MEAN, WHAT ARE WE DOING?

541
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,245
WHO'S GOING WITH WHO?

542
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,751
LOOK, YOU GUYS SHOULD... YOU GUYS SHOULD GO.

543
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,752
NO, UM...

544
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,754
YOU KNOW, YOU PLANNED THIS ALL OUT

545
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,256
AND...

546
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,758
I DON'T WANT TO RUIN IT SO YOU GUYS SHOULD JUST GO.

547
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:00,759
COME ON, MAN.

548
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,761
YOU DROVE ALL THE WAY UP HERE.

549
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,762
NO, NO, REALLY.

550
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,764
I'VE GOT TO TAKE THE CAR BACK ANYWAY.

551
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,766
I'M SPENDING ALL DAY TOMORROW WITH BEN.

552
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,768
IT'S FINE, OKAY?

553
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,769
JUST GO.

554
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,272
NO GUILT. I PROMISE.

555
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,274
THANK YOU.

556
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:19,778
 ALL RIGHT, WE'LL CALL YOU WHEN WE GET BACK.

557
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,779
OKAY.

558
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,781
MAYBE WE CAN GO TO A MOVIE.

559
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,782
OKAY. OKAY.

560
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,284
OR THE RODEO!

561
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,786
THAT'D BE GREAT.

562
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,289
OKAY.

563
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,292
I WAS BEING SHELLEY WINTERS FROM THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.

564
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,795
I KNOW.

565
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,799

566
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,305
 BYE!

567
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,809

568
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,817

569
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:08,327

570
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,828

571
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,829
ROSS!

572
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,331
HI. SORRY I'M LATE.

573
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,832
UH, WERE YOU SLEEPING?

574
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,834
UH... NO.

575
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,336
OH, GREAT. I WAS...

576
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,839
SO I HAD TO GET YOU A WHOLE NEW BATTERY.

577
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,341
I GOT YOU THE BEST ONE I COULD

578
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,342
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHERE YOU WANT TO SKIMP.

579
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,343
YOU'RE A GENIUS, ROSS.

580
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,844
YEAH, WELL, IT CAME TO

581
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,346

582
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,847
JUST CALL IT AN EVEN $110?

583
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,849
OKAY, I'LL PAY YOU TOMORROW.

584
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,850
OKAY.

585
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,851

586
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,852
SO, THEY, UH...

587
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,354

588
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,856
IT WAS PRETTY HARD WATCHING THEM GO, YOU KNOW?

589
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,858
YEAH, OKAY, BYE.

590
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,365
