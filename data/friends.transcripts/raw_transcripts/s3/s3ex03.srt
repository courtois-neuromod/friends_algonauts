1214
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:47,092
WHOA!

1216
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:55,100
SEE, JOE, THAT'S WHY YOUR PARENTS TOLD YOU

1217
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,601
NOT TO JUMP ON THE BED.

1230
00:49:46,251 --> 00:49:48,253
HEY, LOOK AT ME.

1231
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:49,754
I'M MAKING JAM.

1232
00:49:49,754 --> 00:49:51,656
BEEN AT IT SINCE 4:00 THIS MORNING.

1233
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:54,159
WHERE'D YOU GET FRUIT AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING?

1234
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:55,160
WENT DOWN TO THE DOCKS.

1235
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,662
BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU CAN GET IT WHOLESALE.

1236
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:00,165
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WERE DOCKS.

1237
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:03,168
HEY. HEY.

1238
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:05,170
OH, IS IT BROKEN?

1239
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,173
NO, BUT I GOT TO WEAR THIS THING FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

1240
00:50:08,173 --> 00:50:09,674
DID YOU TELL THE DOCTOR YOU DID IT

1241
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:11,176
JUMPING UP AND DOWN ON YOUR BED?

1242
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:14,679
NO. I HAD A WHOLE STORY WORKED OUT, BUT THEN...

1243
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,182
CHANDLER SOLD ME OUT.

1244
00:50:17,182 --> 00:50:18,183
WELL, I'M SORRY, JOE.

1245
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:21,186
I DIDN'T THINK THE DOCTOR WAS GOING TO BUY

1246
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,188
THAT IT JUST FELL OUT OF THE SOCKET.

1247
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:24,689
WHAT IS THIS?

1248
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,191
FRUIT?

1249
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:30,695
MONICA'S MAKING JAM.

1250
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:31,696
WHOA. JAM?

1251
00:50:32,197 --> 00:50:33,198
I LOVE JAM.

1252
00:50:33,198 --> 00:50:36,201
HEY, HOW COME WE NEV ER HAVE JAM AT OUR PLACE?

1253
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:38,203
BECAUSE THE KIDS NEED NEW SHOES.

1254
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:41,706
I'M GOING INTO BUSINESS, PEOPLE.

1255
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:44,709
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF BEING DEPRESSED ABOUT RICHARD.

1256
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:47,212
I NEEDED A PLAN-- A PLAN TO GET OVER MY MAN.

1257
00:50:47,212 --> 00:50:49,214
AND WHAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF "MAN"? JAM.

1258
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:52,217
OH, JOEY, DON'T!

1259
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:53,218
IT'S WAY TOO HOT.

1260
00:50:53,218 --> 00:50:55,220

1261
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:02,727
THIS WILL JUST BE MY BATCH.

1262
00:51:20,245 --> 00:51:21,746
UM, THAT'S IT. NO.

1263
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:23,248
HEY, YOU, J. CREW GUY.

1264
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,250
YEAH. WHY HAVE YOU BEEN FOLLOWING ME?

1265
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,752
ALL WEEK LONG, EVERYWHERE I LOOK, THERE'S YOU.

1266
00:51:28,253 --> 00:51:29,254
YOU WOULDN'T RETURN MY CALLS.

1267
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:30,755
YOU SENT BACK MY LETTERS.

1268
00:51:31,256 --> 00:51:32,257
WHAT?

1269
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:34,259
ONE MORE CHANCE, URSULA, PLEASE.

1270
00:51:34,259 --> 00:51:36,261
OH... OH.

1271
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:39,264
OH, WELL, THIS IS AWKWARD.

1272
00:51:39,264 --> 00:51:40,765
WHAT?

1273
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:42,767
YEAH, BECAUSE YOU WANT URSULA

1274
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:44,769
AND I'M PHOEBE. TWIN SISTERS.

1275
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,772
SERIOUSLY.

1276
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,274
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

1277
00:51:49,274 --> 00:51:51,276
I'M STALKING THE WRONG WOMAN.

1278
00:51:51,276 --> 00:51:53,278
I AM SUCH A DINGUS.

1279
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:56,281
YOU'RE NOT A DINGUS.

1280
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:58,283
I JUST... I WANT YOU TO KNOW

1281
00:51:58,283 --> 00:52:00,285
I DIDN'T USED TO BE LIKE THIS.

1282
00:52:00,285 --> 00:52:01,286
BEFORE I MET YOUR SISTER

1283
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:02,787
I WAS, LIKE, THIS NORMAL GUY

1284
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:04,789
WHO SOLD BEEPERS AND CELLULAR PHONES.

1285
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:05,790
WELL...

1286
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:07,292
I MEAN, LOOK, IT'S...

1287
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:09,294
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, YOU KNOW.

1288
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:11,296
I MEAN, THIS IS JUST...

1289
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:14,299
THIS IS WHAT SHE DOES TO GUYS, OKAY? SO JUST...

1290
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:15,800
WELL, THANKS.

1291
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,802
WAIT. YOU KNOW WHAT?

1292
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,804
I GOT A LITTLE STORY.

1293
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:21,306
WHEN I WAS IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL

1294
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:23,308
I WENT THROUGH THIS PERIOD WHERE I THOUGHT I WAS A WITCH

1295
00:52:23,308 --> 00:52:24,809
AND THERE WAS THIS GUIDANCE COUNSELOR

1296
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:26,811
WHO SAID SOMETHING TO ME

1297
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,813
THAT I THINK WILL HELP YOU A LOT.

1298
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:30,815
HE SAID, "OKAY, YOU'RE NOT A WITCH.

1299
00:52:31,316 --> 00:52:33,318
YOU'RE JUST AN AVERAGE STUDENT."

1300
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:34,319
SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

1301
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,821
NOT REALLY.

1302
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:39,324
UM, WELL, GET OVER IT.

1303
00:52:41,326 --> 00:52:44,829
SO. I MEAN, YOU JUST SEEM LIKE A REALLY NICE GUY

1304
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:46,331
YOU KNOW. I JUST...

1305
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:48,833
DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF, OKAY?

1306
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:49,834
YOU'RE RIGHT.

1307
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:51,336
I KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT.

1308
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:53,338
AND THANKS FOR BEING SO NICE.

1309
00:52:54,339 --> 00:52:55,840
HERE.

1310
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,841
THANKS A LOT.

1311
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:59,844
DO YOU WANT TO GET A CUP OF COFFEE, OR...?

1312
00:53:00,345 --> 00:53:01,346
YEAH, OKAY.

1313
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:02,347
OKAY.

1314
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:06,851
OKAY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WALK BEHIND ME ANYMORE.

1315
00:53:06,851 --> 00:53:07,852
SORRY.

1316
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:09,854
MON?

1317
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:11,356
MON?

1318
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:14,859
"GONE FOR MORE JARS.

1319
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:16,861
BACK LATER. MONICA GELLER."

1320
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:19,364
WAIT A MINUTE. LOOK.

1321
00:53:19,364 --> 00:53:20,365
WHAT?

1322
00:53:20,365 --> 00:53:21,366
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

1323
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:22,867
WHAT, WHAT, WHAT?

1324
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:24,369
IT'S AN EMPTY APARTMENT.

1325
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:27,372
WE'RE ALL ALONE IN AN EMPTY APARTMENT.

1326
00:53:27,372 --> 00:53:28,373
OH, HONEY, COME ON.

1327
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:30,875
I HAVE TO BE AT WORK IN, LIKE, TEN MINUTES

1328
00:53:31,376 --> 00:53:32,377
AND, OHH... ALL RIGHT.

1329
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:33,878
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE

1330
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:36,381
I'M EMPLOYEE OF THE YEAR OR ANYTHING.

1331
00:53:38,383 --> 00:53:39,884

1332
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:41,386
OH!

1333
00:53:41,386 --> 00:53:42,387
THERE IT IS.

1334
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:44,889
OH, THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1335
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:46,891
HEY. HEY.

1336
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:48,893
DO I LOOK FAT?

1337
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:50,895
NO. NO.

1338
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:51,896
OKAY.

1339
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:52,897
I ACCEPT THAT.

1340
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:55,400
WHEN JANICE ASKED ME, AND I SAID NO

1341
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,903
SHE TOOK THAT TO MEAN THAT I WAS CALLING HER A COW.

1342
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:00,905
OKAY, WALK US THROUGH IT, HONEY.

1343
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:02,407
WALK US THROUGH IT.

1344
00:54:02,407 --> 00:54:03,908
OKAY. WELL, JANICE SAID

1345
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:05,410
"HI. DO I LOOK FAT TODAY?"

1346
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:06,911
AND I LOOKED AT HER.

1347
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:07,912
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

1348
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:11,916
YOU LOOKED AT HER?

1349
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,418
YOU NEVER LOOK.

1350
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:14,919
UH UH.

1351
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:16,921
YOU JUST ANSWER.

1352
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:18,423
IT'S LIKE A REFLEX.

1353
00:54:18,423 --> 00:54:20,425
"DO I LOOK FAT?" "NO."

1354
00:54:22,427 --> 00:54:25,930
IS SHE PRETTIER THAN I AM? NO.

1355
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,432
DOES SIZE MATTER?

1356
00:54:27,432 --> 00:54:28,433
NO.

1357
00:54:28,433 --> 00:54:29,934
AND IT WORKS BOTH WAYS.

1358
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:35,940
OKAY, SO YOU BOTH JUST... KNOW THIS STUFF?

1359
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,443
YOU KNOW, AFTER ABOUT 30 OR 40 FIGHTS

1360
00:54:38,443 --> 00:54:39,444
YOU KIND OF CATCH ON.

1361
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:41,946
OKAY. FOR INSTANCE.

1362
00:54:42,447 --> 00:54:43,448
LET'S SAY...

1363
00:54:43,448 --> 00:54:44,949
JANICE IS COMING BACK FROM A TRIP

1364
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:46,951
AND SHE GIVES YOU TWO OPTIONS.

1365
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:48,953
OPTION NUMBER ONE-- SHE'LL TAKE A CAB

1366
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:51,456
HOME FROM THE AIRPORT, OR OPTION NUMBER TWO--

1367
00:54:51,456 --> 00:54:53,458
YOU CAN MEET HER AT BAGGAGE CLAIM.

1368
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:54,459
WHAT DO YOU DO?

1369
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:55,960
THAT'S EASY. BAGGAGE CLAIM.

1370
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,962
BZZZ. WRONG. NOW YOU'RE SINGLE.

1371
00:54:59,964 --> 00:55:03,468
IT'S ACTUALLY SECRET OPTION NUMBER THREE.

1372
00:55:03,468 --> 00:55:04,969
YOU MEET HER AT THE GATE.

1373
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,472
THAT WAY, SHE KNOWS YOU LOVE HER.

1374
00:55:07,472 --> 00:55:09,474
OKAY, THIS IS GOOD. THIS IS GOOD.

1375
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:11,976
ALL RIGHT. LISTEN. I HAVE ONE.

1376
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:13,478
JANICE LIKES TO CUDDLE.

1377
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:15,980
AT NIGHT-- WHICH, YOU KNOW, I'M ALL FOR

1378
00:55:16,481 --> 00:55:19,984
BUT YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU WANT TO GO TO SLEEP, YOU WANT SOME SPACE.

1379
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:23,488
SO, HOW DO I TELL HER THAT WITHOUT, YOU KNOW

1380
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:26,491
ACCIDENTALLY CALLING HER FAT OR SOMETHING?

1381
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:29,494
OH, HONEY, I'M SORRY. WE CAN'T HELP YOU THERE

1382
00:55:29,494 --> 00:55:31,496
BECAUSE WE'RE CUDDLY SLEEPERS.

1383
00:55:32,497 --> 00:55:33,998
OKAY, I'M LATE FOR WORK.

1384
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:35,500
ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO COME DOWN?

1385
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,501
YEAH, YEAH.

1386
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:38,002
I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

1387
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:39,003
GOOD LUCK, CHANDLER.

1388
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:40,004
OKAY. THANK YOU, RACHEL.

1389
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:41,005
BYE, SWEETIE.

1390
00:55:41,506 --> 00:55:42,507
BYE, HONEY.

1391
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:45,009
OKAY, THE SLEEPING THING.

1392
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:47,011
VERY TRICKY BUSINESS

1393
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:50,014
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO.

1394
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:51,516
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE CUDDLY SLEEPERS.

1395
00:55:51,516 --> 00:55:53,518
NO.

1396
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:55,520
NO. NOT CUDDLY.

1397
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,522
NOT ME, JUST HER.

1398
00:55:57,522 --> 00:56:00,024
I'M LIKE YOU-- I NEED THE ROOM.

1399
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:01,025
OKAY, COME HERE.

1400
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:07,031
OKAY. YOU'RE IN BED.

1401
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:08,032
YEAH.

1402
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:13,538
I'M GOING TO USE THE CUSHION.

1403
00:56:13,538 --> 00:56:15,039
YEAH.

1404
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:18,042
OKAY. YOU'RE IN BED.

1405
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:20,545
SHE'S OVER ON YOUR SIDE-- CUDDLING.

1406
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:23,548
NOW, YOU WAIT FOR HER TO DRIFT OFF

1407
00:56:23,548 --> 00:56:26,551
AND THEN YOU HUG HER

1408
00:56:26,551 --> 00:56:31,055
AND ROLL HER OVER TO HER SIDE OF THE BED

1409
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:33,558
AND THEN YOU...

1410
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:37,061
ROLL AWAY.

1411
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:40,064
HUG FOR HER...

1412
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:45,069
ROLL FOR YOU.

1413
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:46,571
OKAY.

1414
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:47,572
THE OLD HUG AND ROLL.

1415
00:56:47,572 --> 00:56:48,573
YEAH.

1416
00:56:48,573 --> 00:56:50,074
OKAY. ONE QUESTION.

1417
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:51,075
SHOOT.

1418
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:52,577
YOU'RE PRETENDING THE PILLOW'S

1419
00:56:52,577 --> 00:56:54,078
A GIRL, RIGHT?

1420
00:56:56,581 --> 00:56:58,583
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE A KID

1421
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:01,085
AND YOUR MOM WOULD DROP YOU OFF AT THE MOVIES

1422
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:03,087
WITH A JAR OF JAM AND A LITTLE SPOON?

1423
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,593
YOU'RE SO PRETTY.

1424
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:14,599
HI.

1425
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:15,600
HEY, PHOEBE.

1426
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,102
HEY, YOU KNOW THAT GUY WHO'S BEEN FOLLOWING ME?

1427
00:57:18,603 --> 00:57:19,604
I TALKED TO HIM TODAY.

1428
00:57:19,604 --> 00:57:21,105
YOU TALKED TO HIM?

1429
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:22,607
ARE YOU CRAZY?

1430
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:26,110
OKAY. FIRST, I'M NOT CRAZY

1431
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:28,112
AND SECOND, SAY IT, DON'T SPRAY IT.

1432
00:57:28,112 --> 00:57:30,114
ANYWAY, HIS NAME IS MALCOLM

1433
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:32,116
AND HE WASN'T FOLLOWING ME.

1434
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:36,120
I MEAN, HE WAS, BUT JUST BECAUSE HE THOUGHT I WAS URSULA, UGH.

1435
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,122
AND...

1436
00:57:38,623 --> 00:57:40,625
THAT'S WHY... THAT'S WHY HE COULDN'T

1437
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:42,627
JUST COME UP AND TALK TO ME.

1438
00:57:42,627 --> 00:57:44,629
BECAUSE OF THE RESTRAINING ORDER.

1439
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:47,632
HMM.

1440
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:50,134
NOT FEELING BETTER ABOUT MALCOLM.

1441
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:51,135
OH.

1442
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:53,638
NO, NO, NO, HE'S NOT, LIKE, A KOOK, NO.

1443
00:57:53,638 --> 00:57:55,640
HE'S JUST, LIKE, THIS VERY PASSIONATE

1444
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,642
INCREDIBLY ROMANTIC GUY

1445
00:57:57,642 --> 00:58:00,645
THAT JUST GOT, LIKE, A TEENSY BIT CARRIED AWAY, YOU KNOW

1446
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:02,647
AND WE JUST GET ALONG REALLY WELL

1447
00:58:02,647 --> 00:58:04,148
AND HE IS SO CUTE.

1448
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:05,149
OH, MY GOD.

1449
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:08,653
YOU'VE GOT A CRUSH ON YOUR SISTER'S STALKER.

1450
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:10,154
NO.

1451
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:11,656
I'M JUST GOING TO HELP HIM

1452
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:13,157
YOU KNOW, GET DE URSULA IZED , LIKE, YOU KNOW

1453
00:58:13,658 --> 00:58:15,159
LIKE I DID FOR JOEY

1454
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:16,661
AFTER HE WENT OUT WITH HER.

1455
00:58:16,661 --> 00:58:18,162
BUT I DIDN'T STALK HER.

1456
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:21,165
I ASKED FOR THE NEWS, NOT THE WEATHER.

1457
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:23,668
HEY, GUYS.

1458
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:24,669
HEY, MON.

1459
00:58:24,669 --> 00:58:25,670
HI, MON.

1460
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:26,671
JOEY.

1461
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:29,674
THIS IS FOR YOU. IT'S BLACKBERRY CURRANT.

1462
00:58:29,674 --> 00:58:31,175
OH!

1463
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:34,679

1464
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,182
OKAY, JOE, I GOT TO ASK.

1465
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:41,686
THE GIRL FROM THE XEROX PLACE, BUCK NAKED

1466
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:45,189
OR A BIG TUB OF JAM?

1467
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:47,692
PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER.

1468
00:58:51,696 --> 00:58:53,197
JOEY, TAKE YOUR TIME WITH THAT.

1469
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:54,198
THAT'S MY LAST BATCH.

1470
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:56,701
NO MORE JAM?

1471
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:59,704
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR JAM PLAN?

1472
00:58:59,704 --> 00:59:02,206
I FIGURED OUT I NEED TO CHARGE 17 BUCKS A JAR

1473
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:03,708
JUST TO BREAK EVEN.

1474
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:05,710
SO, I'VE GOT A NEW PLAN NOW.

1475
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:07,211
BABIES.

1476
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:10,715
WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED MUCH BIGGER JARS.

1477
00:59:12,717 --> 00:59:14,218
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1478
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:16,220
I'M TALKING ABOUT ME HAVING A BABY.

1479
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,722
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

1480
00:59:17,722 --> 00:59:18,723
YEAH. THE GREAT THING

1481
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:20,224
ABOUT THE JAM PLAN WAS

1482
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:22,226
I WAS TAKING CONTROL OF MY LIFE.

1483
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:23,728
SO I ASKED MYSELF

1484
00:59:23,728 --> 00:59:26,230
WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO ME IN THE WORLD?

1485
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,733
AND THAT'S WHEN I CAME UP WITH THE BABY PLAN.

1486
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:30,234
WELL, AREN'T YOU FORGETTING SOMETHING?

1487
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:33,237
WHAT IS... WHAT IS THAT GUY'S NAME--

1488
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:35,239
DAD?

1489
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:37,241
IT TOOK ME 28 YEARS TO FIND ONE MAN

1490
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:39,744
THAT I WANT TO SPEND MY LIFE WITH.

1491
00:59:39,744 --> 00:59:41,746
IF I HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER 28 YEARS

1492
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:44,749
THEN I'LL BE 56 BEFORE I CAN HAVE A BABY

1493
00:59:44,749 --> 00:59:46,751
AND THAT'S JUST STUPID.

1494
00:59:46,751 --> 00:59:50,254
TH THAT'S WHAT'S STUPID?

1495
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:53,257
I DON'T NEED AN ACTUAL MAN.

1496
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:55,760
JUST A COUPLE OF HIS BEST SWIMMERS.

1497
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,263
AND THERE ARE PLACES THAT YOU CAN GO

1498
00:59:59,764 --> 01:00:00,765
TO GET THAT... STUFF.

1499
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:03,768
DOWN TO THE DOCKS AGAIN?

1500
01:00:12,777 --> 01:00:15,780
NIGHT NIGHT, BING A LING.

1501
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:20,785
NIGHT NIGHT... JANICE.

1502
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:27,291
LOOK AT ALL THAT ROOM ON HER SIDE.

1503
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:30,294
YOU COULD FIT A GIANT PENGUIN OVER THERE.

1504
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:33,798
THAT WOULD BE WEIRD, THOUGH.

1505
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:35,299
OKAY.

1506
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:36,801
HUG AND ROLL TIME.

1507
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:39,804
I'M HUGGING. I'M HUGGING.

1508
01:00:39,804 --> 01:00:41,305
YOU'RE ROLLING

1509
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:44,308
AND... YES! FREEDOM.

1510
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:47,311
EXCEPT FOR THIS ARM.

1511
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:49,313
ARM STUCK. STUCK ARM.

1512
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:53,317
OKAY, TIME FOR THE OLD TABLECLOTH TRICK.

1513
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:54,819
ONE FLUID MOTION.

1514
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:56,821
QUICK LIKE A CAT, QUICK LIKE A CAT.

1515
01:00:56,821 --> 01:00:59,824
AND ONE... TWO...

1516
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:00,825
THREE.

1517
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:10,835
AND HERE'S MY BINOCULARS.

1518
01:01:10,835 --> 01:01:11,836
OH, GREAT.

1519
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:13,337
YOU'RE DOING GREAT, YOU KNOW.

1520
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:15,339
REAL STRONG, GOING STRONG.

1521
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:16,340
KEEP GOING.

1522
01:01:16,841 --> 01:01:18,843
THESE ARE MY NIGHT VISION GOGGLES.

1523
01:01:18,843 --> 01:01:20,344
OH.

1524
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:22,346
THIS IS THE BOOK I PRETEND TO READ

1525
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:24,348
WHEN I'M WATCHING HER IN THE PARK

1526
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:26,350
AND THESE AREMAD LIBS.

1527
01:01:26,851 --> 01:01:28,352
THEY'RE JUST FOR FUN.

1528
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:29,353
OH, YEAH.

1529
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:31,856
WHAT'S THIS?

1530
01:01:31,856 --> 01:01:33,858
OH, THIS IS THE LOG I KEPT

1531
01:01:33,858 --> 01:01:36,360
RECORDING HER EVERY MOVEMENT.

1532
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,362
YOU WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING FROM IT?

1533
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:40,364
UM, NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.

1534
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:42,867
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

1535
01:01:42,867 --> 01:01:44,869
OH, OKAY, THEN.

1536
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:51,375
"I MET PHOEBE TODAY.

1537
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,377
"SHE IS REALLY NICE TO ME

1538
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:54,378
EVEN THOUGH I'M SUCH A LOSER."

1539
01:01:54,879 --> 01:01:56,380
OH...

1540
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,882
"AND THEN, WHEN I WAS WALKING HOME

1541
01:01:58,382 --> 01:01:59,383
"I THOUGHT ABOUT HER A LOT.

1542
01:01:59,884 --> 01:02:03,387
IT WAS WEIRD... BUT KIND OF COOL."

1543
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:04,889
GOOD.

1544
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:08,392
SO WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

1545
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:11,896
I WAS THINKING WHAT IT'D BE LIKE TO KISS YOU.

1546
01:02:11,896 --> 01:02:12,897
REALLY?

1547
01:02:12,897 --> 01:02:13,898
NO.

1548
01:02:13,898 --> 01:02:15,399
OH.

1549
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:17,902
SEE, THAT'S JUST SOMETHING

1550
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:20,905
I SAID NOW SO THAT MAYBE I COULD KISS YOU.

1551
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:22,406
OH, OKAY.

1552
01:02:27,912 --> 01:02:29,413
NAH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

1553
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:32,917
I JUST HAD A JAR OF MUSTARD.

1554
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:36,420
OKAY, SPERM DONOR #03815.

1555
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,422
COME ON DOWN!

1556
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:41,425
OKAY, 6'2", 170 POUNDS

1557
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:44,428
AND HE DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS A MALE GEENA DAVIS.

1558
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:47,431
YOU MEAN THERE'S MORE THAN ONE OF US?

1559
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:48,933
YOU CAN'T DO THIS, MON.

1560
01:02:48,933 --> 01:02:49,934
IF YOU DO THIS

1561
01:02:49,934 --> 01:02:51,435
I'M GOING TO, I'M I'M...

1562
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:52,937
YOU'RE GOING TO WHAT?

1563
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:55,439
I'M GOING TO TELL MOM.

1564
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,441
HONEY, I'M SORRY, BUT HE'S RIGHT.

1565
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:59,443
I LOVE YOU, BUT YOU'RE CRAZY.

1566
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:00,444
CRAZY.

1567
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:01,946
WHAT? WHY? WHY IS THIS CRAZY?

1568
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:04,949
SO THIS ISN'T THE IDEAL WAY TO DO SOMETHING.

1569
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:06,951
OH, IT'S NOT THE IDEAL...

1570
01:03:06,951 --> 01:03:08,452
LIPS MOVING, STILL TALKING.

1571
01:03:08,953 --> 01:03:11,455
I MEAN, IT MAY NOT BE IDEAL, BUT...

1572
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:12,456
I'M SO READY.

1573
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:15,960
NOW, I SEE THE WAY BEN LOOKS AT YOU.

1574
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,462
IT MAKES ME ACHE, YOU KNOW?

1575
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:20,965
CHECK IT OUT-- JAM CRACKERS.

1576
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:26,971
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, HOW'S THIS:

1577
01:03:26,971 --> 01:03:30,474
27, ITALIAN AMERICAN GUY.

1578
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:31,976
HE'S AN ACTOR...

1579
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:33,477
BORN IN QUEENS.

1580
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:35,980
WOW. BIG FAMILY.

1581
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:39,483
SEVEN SISTERS, AND HE'S THE ONLY...

1582
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:40,985
BOY.

1583
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:45,990
OH, MY GOD.

1584
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:47,491
UNDER PERSONAL COMMENTS--

1585
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:48,492
"NEW YORK KNICKS RULE."

1586
01:03:48,993 --> 01:03:50,494
YEAH, THE KNICKS RULE!

1587
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:56,500
JOEY, THIS IS YOU.

1588
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,002
LET ME SEE.

1589
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:02,006
OH, RIGHT. YEAH.

1590
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:04,508
WHEN DID YOU GO TO A SPERM BANK?

1591
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:06,510
RIGHT AFTER I DID THAT SEX STUDY DOWN AT N.Y.U.

1592
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,012
HEY, REMEMBER THAT SWEATER

1593
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:10,014
I GAVE YOU FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY?

1594
01:04:10,014 --> 01:04:13,517
AND THAT'S HOW YOU BOUGHT IT?

1595
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:14,518
NO.

1596
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:17,521
THAT'S WHAT I WAS WEARING WHEN I DONATED.

1597
01:04:20,024 --> 01:04:21,025
I'M KIND OF SURPRISED

1598
01:04:21,025 --> 01:04:24,028
THERE'S ANY OF MY BOYS LEFT.

1599
01:04:24,028 --> 01:04:26,030
HONEY, IT IS PRETTY COMPETITIVE.

1600
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:28,032
I'VE GOT AN ACTUAL ROCKET SCIENTIST HERE.

1601
01:04:28,032 --> 01:04:29,533
MAYBE I SHOULD CALL THIS PLACE

1602
01:04:30,034 --> 01:04:31,035
AND GET THEM TO PUT

1603
01:04:31,035 --> 01:04:32,536
MYDAYS OF OUR LIVES GIG ON HERE.

1604
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:34,538
YOU KNOW, JUICE THIS PUPPY UP A LITTLE.

1605
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:36,540

1606
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,541
HELLO.

1607
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:38,542
 HEY.

1608
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:40,044
 HOW'S THE MANIAC?

1609
01:04:40,044 --> 01:04:41,045
OH, HE'S YUMMY.

1610
01:04:41,045 --> 01:04:43,047
WE DID A LITTLE KISSIN'.

1611
01:04:43,047 --> 01:04:46,050
PHOEBE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1612
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:47,551
OH, NO, NO, NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?

1613
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:49,053
HE'S NOT INTO THAT STUFF ANYMORE.

1614
01:04:49,053 --> 01:04:51,055
HE QUIT FOR ME.

1615
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:54,558
PHEEBS, THIS GUY HAS BEEN OBSESSED WITH YOUR SISTER

1616
01:04:54,558 --> 01:04:56,560
FOR GOD KNOWS HOW LONG, OKAY?

1617
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:59,063
YOU DON'T JUST GIVE UP SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

1618
01:04:59,063 --> 01:05:00,064
LOOK, HE GAVE ME

1619
01:05:00,064 --> 01:05:02,566
HIS NIGHT VISION GOGGLES AND EVERYTHING.

1620
01:05:03,067 --> 01:05:04,068
YOU'RE TAKING THE WORD

1621
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:07,571
OF A GUY WHO HAS NIGHT VISION GOGGLES?

1622
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:09,073
HE'S NOT STILL FOLLOWING HER.

1623
01:05:09,073 --> 01:05:11,575
YOU THINK HE'S STILL FOLLOWING HER?

1624
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:14,578
PHEEBS, WAKE UP AND SMELL THE RESTRAINING ORDER.

1625
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:18,082
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING I SHOULD DO?

1626
01:05:18,082 --> 01:05:20,084
I THINK THAT IF YOU REALLY LIKE THIS GUY

1627
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:21,085
YOU SHOULD JUST TRUST HIM.

1628
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:23,087
THANK YOU, MONICA.

1629
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:24,588
OR YOU COULD FOLLOW HIM

1630
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:25,589
AND SEE WHERE HE GOES.

1631
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:28,092
OH, THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO.

1632
01:05:28,092 --> 01:05:29,093
FORGET MINE.

1633
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:31,595
 OH, MY GOD!

1634
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:32,596
WHAT HAPPENED?

1635
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:34,098
OH, GOD, CRAZY CHANDLER.

1636
01:05:34,098 --> 01:05:37,101
HE SPUN ME OFF THE BED.

1637
01:05:37,101 --> 01:05:38,102
WOW!

1638
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:40,104
SPINNING-- THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

1639
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:41,105
OH.

1640
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:42,606

1641
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:44,108
I WISH.

1642
01:05:44,108 --> 01:05:46,610
YOU KNOW, HE WAS JUST TRYING

1643
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,612
ROSS' HUG- AND ROLL THING.

1644
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:51,615
ROSS' WHAT?

1645
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,616
YOU KNOW

1646
01:05:53,117 --> 01:05:54,118
LIKE, WHERE HE HUGS YOU

1647
01:05:54,118 --> 01:05:57,121
AND THEN HE KIND OF ROLLS YOU AWAY AND...

1648
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:03,627
OH... MY... GOD.

1649
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:36,660
PHOEBE?

1650
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:39,663
YES? YES! OH!

1651
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:41,665
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1652
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:44,168
OH, I WAS JUST HERE LOOKING FOR MY, UM...

1653
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:46,170
MY PART OF AN OLD SANDWICH.

1654
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:48,172
HERE IT IS! OH!

1655
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:52,176
WERE YOU FOLLOWING ME?

1656
01:06:52,176 --> 01:06:54,178
UM, PERHAPS.

1657
01:06:54,178 --> 01:06:55,679
YES.

1658
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:57,181
YES, I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

1659
01:06:57,681 --> 01:06:58,682
I WAS JUST AFRAID

1660
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:01,185
THAT YOU WERE STILL HUNG UP ON MY SISTER.

1661
01:07:01,185 --> 01:07:03,687
SO YOU SPIED ON ME?

1662
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:06,190
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DON'T TRUST ME.

1663
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:13,697
OH, WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

1664
01:07:13,697 --> 01:07:16,200
THERE GOES MY IDENTICAL TWIN SISTER

1665
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,203
JUST WALKING ALONG LOOKING LIKE ME!

1666
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:22,706
WHAT IS THIS, JUST, LIKE, A FREAKISH COINCIDENCE

1667
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:24,708
OR DID YOU KNOW THAT SHE TAKES THIS TRAIN?

1668
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:27,211
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

1669
01:07:27,211 --> 01:07:29,713
I TRIED TO STOP, BUT I COULDN'T.

1670
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:32,216
I'M SO PATHETIC.

1671
01:07:32,216 --> 01:07:34,218
NO, NO. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

1672
01:07:34,218 --> 01:07:35,719
IT'S PARTLY MY FAULT

1673
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:39,223
BECAUSE I MADE YOU QUIT COLD TURKEY.

1674
01:07:39,223 --> 01:07:40,724
IT'S TOO HARD, YOU KNOW?

1675
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:43,227
OKAY, WELL, I MEAN, I CAN'T DATE YOU ANYMORE

BUT I WILL DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY HELP YOU

1679
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:52,236
GET OVER MY SISTER, OKAY?

1680
01:07:52,236 --> 01:07:55,239

01:08:08,252 --> 01:08:09,753
OOH, WHICH WAY AM I GOING TO GO?

1689
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:11,755

1694
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:19,263
SPERM OR REGULAR?

1695
01:08:19,263 --> 01:08:20,764
SPERM.

1696
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:22,766
SO YOU'RE REALLY DOING IT, HUH?

1697
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:23,767

01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:26,270
PICKED A GUY-- 37135.

I'D SAY SO.

1701
01:08:29,273 --> 01:08:31,275
HE'S GOT BROWN HAIR AND GREEN EYES.

1702
01:08:31,275 --> 01:08:32,776
NO KIDDING. HMM.

1703
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:33,777
WHAT?

1704
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:36,280
I FIGURED YOU WOULD HAVE PICKED A BLOND GUY.

1705
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:37,781
REALLY? WHY?

1706
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:38,782
I DON'T KNOW.

1707
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:40,284
I ALWAYS PICTURED YOU ENDING UP

1708
01:08:40,284 --> 01:08:42,786

01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:48,792
IT'S A NAME, YEAH.

1712
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:50,294
I SAW YOU

1713
01:08:50,294 --> 01:08:53,297
IN THIS, YOU KNOW, THIS GREAT HOUSE

1714
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:54,798
WITH A BIG POOL...

1715
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:56,300
YEAH? IS HE A SWIMMER?

1716
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,301

1717
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:59,303
HE'S GOT THE BODY FOR IT.

1718
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:01,305
OOH, I LIKE THAT.

1719
01:09:01,305 --> 01:09:03,807

1720
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:04,808
WHAT?

1721
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:05,809
YOU GUYS HAVE

1722
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,311
ONE OF THOSE SIGNS THAT SAYS

1723
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:09,313
"WE DON'T SWIM IN YOUR TOILET

1724
01:09:09,313 --> 01:09:11,315
SO DON'T PEE IN OUR POOL," YOU KNOW?

1725
01:09:11,315 --> 01:09:13,317
WE DO NOT HAVE ONE OF THOSE SIGNS.

1726
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:15,319
SURE, YOU DO.

1727
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:16,820
IT WAS A GIFT FROM ME.

1728
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,823
OH! AND YOU HAVE THESE THREE GREAT KIDS.

1729
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:21,325
TWO GIRLS AND A BOY?

1730
01:09:21,325 --> 01:09:22,826
YEAH.

1731
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,828
AND THEY WEAR THOSE LITTLE WATER WINGS

1732
01:09:25,329 --> 01:09:27,831
YOU KNOW, AND THEY'RE RUNNING AROUND ON THE DECK

1733
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:29,333
AND THEN, HOYT WRAPS THIS BIG TOWEL

1734
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:30,834
AROUND ALL THREE OF THEM.

1735
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:32,336
SURE.

1736
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:38,842
BUT, HEY, YOU KNOW

1737
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:41,345
THIS WAY SOUNDS GOOD, TOO.

1738
01:09:41,345 --> 01:09:43,847
YEAH.

1739
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:49,853
OH, MONICA.

1740
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,363
WOW! THIS GUY'S AN ASTRONAUT?

1741
01:10:00,364 --> 01:10:03,367
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN COOL...

1742
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:04,868
FOR, LIKE, A DAY.

1743
01:10:13,377 --> 01:10:15,379
SHE'LL BE BACK AT 5:00!

1744
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,382
5:00!

1745
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:26,890
I CALLED THE SPERM BANK TODAY.

1746
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:28,392
THEY HAVEN'T SOLD

1747
01:10:28,392 --> 01:10:30,394
A SINGLE UNIT OF TRIBBIANI.

1748
01:10:30,394 --> 01:10:32,396
NOBODY WANTS MY PRODUCT.

1749
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:36,400
I MEAN, I DON'T GET IT, YOU KNOW?

1750
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:41,905
I MEAN...

1751
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:44,908
MAYBE IF THEY MET ME IN PERSON...

1763
01:11:14,438 --> 01:11:18,442
