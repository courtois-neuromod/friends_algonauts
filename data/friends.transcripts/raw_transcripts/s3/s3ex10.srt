1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,504
I DON'T KNOW. WHAT?

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,007
WELL, AS OLD AS HE IS IN DOG YEARS

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:11,011
DO YOU THINK SNOOPY SHOULD STILL BE ALLOWED TO FLY THIS THING?

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,512
RACHEL? YEAH?

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,514
YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU FIRST CAME HERE

6
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,516
HOW YOU SPENT TWO WEEKS GETTING TRAINED

7
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,517
BY ANOTHER WAITRESS?

8
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:20,520
OH, SURE! DO YOU NEED ME TO TRAIN SOMEBODY NEW?

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,023
GOOD ONE.

10
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,524
ACTUALLY, TERRY WANTS YOU

11
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:28,028
TO TAKE THE TRAINING AGAIN.

12
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,029
WHENEVER.

13
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,534
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,041
YEAH.

27
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,091
SO THAT'S TWO BOXES

28
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,094
OF THE HOLIDAY MACAROONS.

29
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,097
ON BEHALF OF THE BROWN BIRDS OF AMERICA

30
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,098
I SALUTE YOU.

31
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,600

32
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,103
JUST ADMIT IT, CHANDLER, YOU HAVE NO BACKHAND.

33
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,105
EXCUSE ME, LITTLE ONE.

34
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,107
I HAVE A VERY SOLID BACKHAND.

35
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,610
SHIELDING YOUR FACE AND SHRIEKING LIKE A GIRL

36
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,113
IS NOT A BACKHAND.

37
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,614
I WAS SHRIEKING...

38
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,616
LIKE A MARINE.

39
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,118
ALL RIGHT, HERE.

40
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:03,123
WATCH ME EXECUTE THE THREE Ps OF CHAMPIONSHIP PLAY.

41
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,125
POWER. HA!

42
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,626
PRECISION. SHHK!

43
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,128
AND PANACHE.

44
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,130

45
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,634
YOU BROKE A LITTLE GIRL'S LEG?

46
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,635
I KNOW.

47
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,637
I FEEL HORRIBLE, OKAY?

48
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,140
IT SAYS HERE THAT A MUPPET GOT WHACKED

49
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,142
ON SESAME STREET LAST NIGHT.

50
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,644
WHERE EXACTLY WERE YOU AROUND TEN ISH?

51
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,147
WELL, I'M GOING TO GO SEE HER.

52
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,149
I WANT TO BRING HER SOMETHING.

53
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,651
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE'D LIKE?

54
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,653
MAYBE A "HELLO, KITTY" DOLL

55
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,155
THE ABILITY TO WALK.

56
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,159

57
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,661
I'M GOING TO GET BACK TO RETRAINING.

58
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,163
ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU, GUYS.

59
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,165
LOOK OUT, KIDS. HE'S COMING.

60
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,670
AND I GOT TO GO SELL SOME CHRISTMAS TREES.

61
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,172
HAVE FUN. OH, WAIT.

62
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,174
NO, DON'T. I FORGOT.

63
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,676
I AM TOTALLY AGAINST THAT NOW.

64
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,179
WHAT, ME HAVING A JOB?

65
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,180
NO, NO.

66
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,184
I AM AGAINST INNOCENT TREES BEING CUT DOWN

67
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,185
IN THEIR PRIME

68
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,688
AND THEIR CORPSES GROTESQUELY DRESSED

69
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,191
IN TINSEL AND TWINKLY LIGHTS.

70
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,693
HEY, HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT?

71
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,196
WELL, I'M PRETTY TIRED FROM LUGGING

72
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,198
THE TREES AROUND.

73
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,699
HEY, PHOEBE, LISTEN.

74
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,201
YOU GOT THIS ALL WRONG.

75
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,204
THOSE TREES WERE BORN TO BE CHRISTMAS TREES.

76
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,207
THEY'RE FULFILLING THEIR LIFE PURPOSE

77
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,708
BY MAKING PEOPLE HAPPY.

78
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,210
REALLY?

79
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,712
YES.

80
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,715
YES, AND, UH... THE TREES ARE HAPPY, TOO

81
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,717
BECAUSE FOR MOST OF THEM

82
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,221
IT'S THEIR ONLY CHANCE TO SEE NEW YORK.

83
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,726
AND AFTER YOU'VE DELIVERED THE DRINKS

84
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,728
YOU TAKE THE EMPTY TRAY...

85
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,729
GUNTHER, PLEASE.

86
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,232
I'VE WORKED HERE FOR 2ï¿½ YEARS.

87
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,734
I KNOW THE EMPTY TRAYS GO OVER THERE.

88
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,237
WHAT IF YOU PUT THEM HERE?

89
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,239
HUH.

90
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,740
YOU KNOW, THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD IDEA

91
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,243
BECAUSE THAT WAY THEY'LL BE CLOSER TO THE MUGS.

92
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,245
YOU SHOULD HAVE THE OTHER WAITRESSES DO THAT, TOO.

93
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,747
THEY ALREADY DO.

94
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,751
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT "THE TRAY SPOT."

95
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,753
GEEZ, I ALWAYS HEARD THEM TALK ABOUT THAT.

96
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,257
I SORT OF JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A CLUB THEY WENT TO.

97
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,758
OH, GOD.

98
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,260
I'M SORRY.

99
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,761
IT'S ALL RIGHT...

100
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,764
SWEETHEART.

101
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,270
SO, THIS MUST BE KIND OF NEAT FOR YOU, HUH?

102
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,773
YOUR DAD TELLS ME YOU GET A COUPLE OF DAYS OFF SCHOOL

103
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,777
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO SELL THOSE COOKIES ANYMORE.

104
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,280
WELL, I KIND OF WANTED TO SELL THE COOKIES.

105
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,783
THE GIRL WHO SELLS THE MOST WINS A TRIP TO SPACE CAMP

106
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,786
AND GETS TO SIT IN A REAL SPACE SHUTTLE.

107
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,288
WELL, YOU, UH...

108
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,790
YOU REALLY LIKE ALL THIS SPACE STUFF, HUH?

109
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,292
YEAH.

110
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,293
MY DAD SAYS

111
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,296
IF I SPENT AS MUCH TIME HELPING HIM CLEAN APARTMENTS

112
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,298
AS I DO DAYDREAMING ABOUT OUTER SPACE

113
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,800
HE'D BE ABLE TO AFFORD A TRIP TO THE TAJ MAHAL.

114
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,303
I THINK YOU'D HAVE TO CLEAN A WHOLE LOT OF APARTMENTS

115
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,305
TO GO ALL THE WAY TO INDIA.

116
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,307
NO, THE ONE IN ATLANTIC CITY.

117
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,808
DAD LOVES THE SLOTS.

118
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,314
HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO DOUBLE THE COLLEGE MONEY

119
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,316
MY GRANDMA LEFT ME.

120
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,319
HUH. WELL, GOOD LUCK TO DAD.

121
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,820

122
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,824
SAY, HOW MANY MORE BOXES WOULD YOU HAVE TO SELL

123
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,825
IN ORDER TO WIN?

124
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,329
THE GIRL WHO WON LAST YEAR SOLD 475.

125
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,330
YEAH?

126
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,333
SO FAR, I'VE SOLD 75.

127
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,337
400, HUH?

128
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,839
WELL, THAT SOUNDS DOABLE.

129
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,841
HOW MUCH ARE THE BOXES?

130
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,343
FIVE DOLLARS A BOX.

131
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,346
AND WHAT IS SECOND PRIZE?

132
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,847
A TEN SPEED BIKE

133
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,351
BUT I'D RATHER HAVE SOMETHING MY DAD COULDN'T SELL.

134
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,355
WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE.

135
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,857
COULD YOU DO ME ONE FAVOR, IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE?

136
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,859
YEAH, SARAH, ANYTHING.

137
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,861
COULD YOU PULL THE CURTAINS OPEN FOR ME?

138
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,863
THE ASTRONAUTS FROM THE SPACE SHUTTLE

139
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,365
ARE GOING TO BE ON THE NEWS.

140
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,866
SINCE WE DON'T HAVE A TV

141
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,370
THE LADY ACROSS THE ALLEY SAID SHE'D PUSH HERS UP TO HER WINDOW

142
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,872
SO I CAN WATCH IT.

143
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,384
Old  YES?

144
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,887
HI. I'M SELLING BROWN BIRD COOKIES.

145
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,889
YOU'RE NO BROWN BIRD.

146
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,393
I CAN SEE YOU THROUGH MY PEEPHOLE.

147
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,894
UM, NO, HI.

148
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,397
I'M AN HONORARY BROWN BIRD.

149
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,400

150
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,402
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

151
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,405
WELL, IT MEANS THAT I CAN SELL COOKIES

152
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,907
BUT I'M NOT INVITED TO SLEEPOVERS.

153
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,914
I CAN DIAL 911 AT THE PRESS OF A BUTTON, YOU KNOW.

154
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,416
NOW, GO AWAY!

155
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,417
PLEASE, PLEASE.

156
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,920
IT'S FOR A POOR LITTLE GIRL WHO WANTS TO GO TO SPACE CAMP

157
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,922
MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD.

158
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,424
I'M PRESSING.

159
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,426
A POLICEMAN IS ON HIS WAY.

160
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,428
OKAY, OKAY, I'M GOING.

161
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,929
I'M GOING.

162
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,935
I CAN STILL SEE YOU!

163
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,937
ALL RIGHT!

164
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,941
HEY.

165
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,944
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

166
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,947
WELL, I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID

167
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,449
AND I REALIZED...

168
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,951
MAYBE I WAS A LITTLE JUDGMENTAL.

169
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,953
YEAH, OH, BUT, OH...

170
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,955
NOW, PHOEBE, REMEMBER, HEY...

171
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,958
THEY'RE JUST FULFILLING THEIR CHRISTMAS...

172
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,460
DESTINY. YES. SURE.

173
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,461
RIGHT.

174
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,962
OKAY.

175
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,966
YIKES, THAT ONE DOESN'T LOOK VERY FULFILLED.

176
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,468
THAT'S ONE OF THE OLD ONES.

177
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,470
HE'S JUST TAKING IT TO THE BACK.

178
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,972
YOU KEEP THE OLD ONES IN THE BACK?

179
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,475
THAT IS SO AGEIST.

180
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,977
WELL, WE HAVE TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FRESH ONES.

181
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,480
SO, WHAT HAPPENS TO THE OLD GUYS?

182
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,982
THEY GO INTO THE CHIPPER.

183
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,484
WHY DO I HAVE THE FEELING

184
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,986
THAT'S NOT AS HAPPY AS IT SOUNDS?

185
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,490

186
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,991
NO... NO!

187
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,999
HEY, HEY, HEY!

188
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,504
AND THESE COME IN THE SHAPES

189
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,006
OF YOUR FAVORITE CHRISTMAS CHARACTERS--

190
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,009
SANTA, RUDOLPH, AND BABY JESUS.

191
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:34,514
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE A BOX OF THE CREAM FILLED JESUSES.

192
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,015
WAIT A MINUTE. ONE BOX?

193
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,518
COME ON, I'M TRYING TO SEND A POOR LITTLE GIRL TO SPACE CAMP.

194
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,020
I'M PUTTING YOU DOWN FOR FIVE BOXES.

195
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,522
CHANDLER, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

196
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:47,026
ALL RIGHT, DO YOU HAVE ANY COCONUT FLAVORED DEITIES?

197
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,027
NO, BUT, UH

198
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,530
THERE'S COCONUT IN THE HANUKKAH MENOREOS.

199
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,533
I TELL YOU WHAT, I'LL PUT YOU DOWN FOR EIGHT BOXES--

200
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,034
ONE FOR EACH NIGHT.

201
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,036
MON?

202
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,539
ALL RIGHT. I'LL TAKE ONE BOX OF THE MINT TREASURES--

203
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,040
ONE, AND THAT'S IT.

204
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,544
I STARTED GAINING WEIGHT AFTER I JOINED THE BROWN BIRDS.

205
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,046
REMEMBER? DAD BOUGHT EVERY ONE OF MY BOXES

206
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,548
AND I ATE THEM ALL.

207
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,552
NO, MON, DAD HAD TO BUY EVERY ONE OF YOUR BOXES

208
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,554
BECAUSE YOU ATE THEM ALL.

209
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,057
BUT, UH...

210
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:21,060
YOU KNOW, I'M SURE THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN THIS TIME.

211
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,564
WHY DON'T I JUST PUT YOU DOWN FOR THREE OF THE MINT TREASURES

212
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,566
AND JUST A COUPLE OF THE RUDOLPHS?

213
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,067
NO.

214
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,571
OH, COME ON, NOW.

215
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,573
YOU KNOW YOU WANT THEM.

216
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,575
DON'T... DON'T... DON'T DO THIS.

217
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,076
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, MON--

218
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,580
I'LL GIVE YOU THE FIRST BOX FOR FREE.

219
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,583
OH, GOD, I GOT TO GO!

220
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,584
COME ON.

221
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,086
ALL THE COOL KIDS ARE EATING THEM.

222
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,088
 WHEN YOU HAVE A SECOND LATER

223
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,590
I WANT TO SHOW YOU

224
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,593
WHY WE DON'T JUST TRAP SPIDERS UNDER COFFEE MUGS

225
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,094
AND LEAVE THEM THERE.

226
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,600
I'M RETRAINING TO BE BETTER AT A JOB THAT I HATE.

227
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,102
MY LIFE OFFICIALLY SUCKS.

228
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,104
BUT RACH, WASN'T THIS SUPPOSED TO BE A TEMPORARY THING?

229
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,106
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO DO FASHION STUFF.

230
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,609
WELL, YEAH, I'M STILL PURSUING THAT.

231
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,111
HOW EXACTLY ARE YOU PURSUING THAT?

232
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,614
YOU KNOW, OTHER THAN SENDING OUT RESUMES

233
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,616
LIKE, WHAT, TWO YEARS AGO?

234
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,620
WELL, I'M ALSO SENDING OUT...

235
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,122
GOOD THOUGHTS.

236
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,624
IF YOU ASK ME

237
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,626
AS LONG AS YOU GOT THIS JOB

238
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,630
YOU GOT NOTHING PUSHING YOU TO GET ANOTHER ONE.

239
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,131
YOU NEED THE FEAR.

240
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,133
THE FEAR?

241
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,635
HE'S RIGHT. IF YOU QUIT THIS JOB

242
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,637
YOU THEN HAVE MOTIVATION TO GO AFTER A JOB

243
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,638
YOU REALLY WANT.

244
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,640
THEN HOW COME YOU'RE STILL AT A JOB

245
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,641
THAT YOU HATE?

246
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,643
WHY DON'T YOU QUIT AND GET THE FEAR?

247
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,146
BECAUSE I'M TOO AFRAID.

248
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,648
OH, GOD.

249
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,649
I DON'T KNOW.

250
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,150
I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING

251
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,653
TO WORK FOR A DESIGNER, YOU KNOW, OR A BUYER.

252
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,155
OH, I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE 30

253
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,657
AND STILL WORK HERE.

254
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,659
YEAH, THAT'D BE MUCH WORSE

255
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,662
THAN BEING 28 AND STILL WORKING HERE.

256
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,663
RACHEL?

257
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,664
YEAH?

258
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,666
REMIND ME TO REVIEW WITH YOU

259
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,669
WHICH POT IS DECAF AND WHICH IS REGULAR.

260
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,172
CAN'T I JUST LOOK AT THE HANDLES ON THEM?

261
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,674
YOU WOULD THINK.

262
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,175
OKAY, FINE.

263
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,677
GUNTHER, YOU KNOW WHAT?

264
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,178
I AM A TERRIBLE WAITRESS.

265
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,681
DO YOU KNOW WHY I AM A TERRIBLE WAITRESS?

266
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,683
BECAUSE I DON'T CARE.

267
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,685
I DON'T CARE WHICH POT IS REGULAR

268
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,687
AND WHICH POT IS DECAF.

269
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,689
I DON'T CARE WHERE THE TRAY SPOT IS.

270
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,190
I JUST DON'T CARE.

271
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,192
THIS IS NOT WHAT I WANT TO DO.

272
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,696
SO I DON'T THINK I SHOULD DO IT ANYMORE.

273
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,699
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU MY WEEK'S NOTICE.

274
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,700
WHAT?

275
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,201
GUNTHER, I QUIT.

276
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,704
DOES THIS MEAN

277
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,707
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO START PAYING FOR COFFEE?

278
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,715
OKAY, 12...

279
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,216
22...

280
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,218
18...

281
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,224
WHAT?

282
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,226
I SPELLED OUT "BOOBIES."

283
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,231
ROSS

284
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,734
PUT ME DOWN FOR ANOTHER BOX

285
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,235
OF THE MINT TREASURES, OKAY?

286
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,738
WHERE ARE THE MINT TREASURES?

287
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,739
UH, WE'RE OUT.

288
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,740
I SOLD THEM ALL.

289
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,742
WHAT?

290
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,745
MONICA, I'M CUTTING YOU OFF.

291
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,249
NO... NO.

292
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,252
JU JUST A COUPLE MORE BOXES.

293
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,255
IT'S NO BIG DEAL, ALL RIGHT?

294
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,256
I I'M COOL.

295
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,261
YOU GOT TO HELP ME OUT WITH A COUPLE MORE BOXES!

296
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,763
MON, LOOK AT YOURSELF.

297
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,765
YOU HAVE COOKIE ON YOUR NECK.

298
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,266
OH, GOD!

299
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,771
SO, HOW MANY HAVE YOU SOLD SO FAR?

300
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,774
CHECK THIS OUT-- 517 BOXES.

301
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,777
OH, MY GOD! HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

302
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,780
OKAY, THE OTHER NIGHT, I WAS LEAVING THE MUSEUM

303
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,782
JUST AS "LASER FLOYD" WAS LETTING OUT

304
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,283
OF THE PLANETARIUM.

305
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,786
WITHOUT EVEN TRYING, I SOLD 50 BOXES.

306
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,789
THAT'S WHEN IT OCCURRED TO ME-- THE KEY TO MY SUCCESS:

307
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,290
THE MUNCHIES.

308
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,793
SO, I, UH

309
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:19,799
STARTED HITTING THE N.Y.U. DORMS AROUND MIDNIGHT.

310
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,802
I AM SELLING COOKIES BY THE CASE.

311
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,305
THEY CALL ME "COOKIE DUDE!"

312
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,810
OKAY, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO CALL YOU THAT.

313
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,812
OKAY.

314
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,814
OKAY, EVERYBODY STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

315
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,315
I NEED ENVELOPE STUFFERS.

316
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,817
I NEED STAMP LICKERS.

317
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,819
WELL, HEY, WHO DID THESE RESUMES FOR YOU?

318
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,320
ME, ON MY COMPUTER.

319
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,822
YOU SURE USED A LARGE FONT.

320
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,823
EH, YEAH.

321
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,325
WELL, UH, "WAITRESS AT A COFFEE HOUSE"

322
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,828
AND, UH, "CHEER SQUAD CO CAPTAIN"

323
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,329
ONLY TOOK UP SO MUCH ROOM.

324
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,332
HA HA HEY, THAT'S FUNNY.

325
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,834
YOU'RE FUNNY, CHANDLER.

326
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,835
YOU'RE A FUNNY GUY!

327
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,337
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS REALLY FUNNY?

328
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,340
SOMETHING ELSE I MIGHT HAVE SAID?

329
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,342
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.

330
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,845
WEREN'T YOU THE GUY THAT TOLD ME TO QUIT MY JOB

331
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,347
WHEN I HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE TO DO?

332
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,349
HA HA HA HA HA!

333
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,353
SWEETIE, CALM DOWN. IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

334
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,855
NO, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE OKAY, ROSS.

335
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,858
TOMORROW IS MY LAST DAY, AND I DON'T HAVE A LEAD.

336
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,359
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

337
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,861
I'M JUST GOING TO CALL GUNTHER

338
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,363
AND I'M GOING TO TELL HIM I'M NOT QUITTING.

339
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,366
BUT, YOU YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE IN TO THE FEAR?

340
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,368
YOU AND YOUR STUPID FEAR.

341
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,369
I HATE YOUR FEAR!

342
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,871
I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE YOU

343
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,372
AND YOUR FEAR...

344
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,375
HEY! I GOT GREAT NEWS!

345
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,376
RUN, JOEY!

346
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,879
RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!

347
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,380
WHAT? RACH, LISTEN.

348
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,383
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF FORTUNATA FASHIONS?

349
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,384
NO.

350
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,887
MY OLD MAN'S DOING A PLUMBING JOB DOWN THERE

351
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,388
AND HE HEARD THEY HAVE AN OPENING.

352
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,391
SO YOU WANT ME TO SEE IF HE CAN GET YOU AN INTERVIEW?

353
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,393
OH, MY GOD, YES! I WOULD LOVE THAT.

354
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,394
THAT'S SO SWEET, JOEY.

355
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,896
NOT A PROBLEM.

356
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,898
AND NOW FOR THE GREAT NEWS.

357
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,900
WHAT? THAT WASN'T THE GREAT NEWS?

358
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,402
ONLY IF YOU THINK IT'S BETTER THAN THIS...

359
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,405
SNOW IN A CAN!

360
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,907
I GOT IT AT WORK.

361
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,909
MON, YOU WANT ME TO DECORATE THE WINDOW?

362
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,911
GIVE IT KIND OF A CHRISTMAS LOOKY?

363
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,913
CHRISTMAS COOKIE?

364
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,420
OKAY, AND THIS ONE HERE IS A DOUGLAS FIR.

365
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,922
NOW, IT'S A LITTLE MORE MONEY

366
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,424
BUT YOU GET A NICER SMELL.

367
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,426
LOOKS GOOD. I'LL TAKE IT.

368
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,928
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, NO, NO.

369
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,429
YOU DON'T WANT THAT ONE.

370
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,932
NO, YOU CAN HAVE THIS COOL BROWN ONE.

371
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,934
OOH...

372
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,436
IT IT'S ALMOST DEAD!

373
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,939
OKAY, BUT THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO BUY IT.

374
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,941
SO IT CAN FULFILL ITS CHRISTMAS DESTINY.

375
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,944
OTHERWISE, THEY'RE GOING TO THROW IT INTO THE CHIPPER.

376
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,945
TELL HIM, JOEY.

377
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,447
YEAH, THE TREES THAT DON'T FULFILL

378
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:52,451
THEIR CHRISTMAS DESTINY ARE THROWN IN THE CHIPPER.

379
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:56,455
I THINK I'M GOING TO LOOK AROUND A LITTLE BIT MORE.

380
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,458
PHEEBS... YOU GOT TO STOP DOING THIS.

381
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,460
I'M WORKING ON COMMISSION HERE.

382
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,461
OH...

383
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,462
HEY, GUYS.

384
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,965
I'M HERE TO PICK OUT MY CHRISTMAS TREE.

385
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,466
WELL, LOOK NO FURTHER.

386
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,467
THIS ONE'S YOURS.

387
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,469
AH...

388
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,470
IS THIS THE ONE

389
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,473
THAT I THREW OUT LAST YEAR?

390
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,975
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

391
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,976
NEVER MIND!

392
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,979
EVERYBODY WANTS TO HAVE A GREEN ONE!

393
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:20,980
SORRY. I'M SORRY.

394
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,481
I DIDN'T MEAN TO GET SO EMOTIONAL.

395
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,983
I GUESS IT'S JUST...

396
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,985
THE HOLIDAYS ARE JUST HARD.

397
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,989
OH, HONEY, IS THAT BECAUSE YOUR MOM DIED AROUND CHRISTMAS?

398
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,491
OH, I WASN'T EVEN THINKING ABOUT THAT.

399
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,493
OH.

400
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,501
HI THERE.

401
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,503
HOW MANY... HOW MANY DID YOU SELL?

402
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,505
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU.

403
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,507
YOU'RE THE BAD MAN WHO BROKE SARAH'S LEG.

404
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,512
HEY, NOW, THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT, OKAY?

405
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,014
YOU'RE A BIG SCRUD.

406
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,018
WHAT'S A SCRUD?

407
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,020
WHY DON'T YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR, SCRUD?

408
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,523
I DON'T HAVE TO.

409
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,027
I CAN JUST LOOK AT YOU.

410
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,528
ALL RIGHT, GIRLS...

411
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,031
AND MAN.

412
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,533
LET'S SEE YOUR FINAL TALLIES.

413
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,536
OH... DEBBIE.

414
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,539
321 BOXES OF COOKIES.

415
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,541
VERY NICE.

416
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,543
NOT NICE ENOUGH.

417
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,046
CHARLA...

418
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,048
278.

419
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,050
SORRY, DEAR, BUT STILL GOOD.

420
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,052
GOOD FOR ASCRUD.

421
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,058
OOH, YES, ELIZABETH.

422
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,560
OH! 871!

423
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,064
THAT'S CRAP!

424
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,568
...SISTER BROWN BIRD.

425
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,070
GOOD GOING.

426
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:57,576
WHO'S NEXT?

427
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,078

428
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,580
HI THERE.

429
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,582
HI.

430
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,585
AND BATTING FOR SARAH...

431
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,088
ROSS GELLER.

432
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,091
872.

433
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,094
ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE YOU BOUGHT

434
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,596
AN AWFUL LOT OF COOKIES YOURSELF.

435
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,098
THAT IS BECAUSE MY DOCTOR

436
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:24,603
SAYS THAT I HAVE A VERY SERIOUS...

437
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:28,107
NOUGAT...

438
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,109
DEFICIENCY.

439
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,612
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED, BROWN BIRD ROSS.

440
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,116
WELL, I LOST.

441
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,118
SOME LITTLE GIRL LOANED HER UNIFORM

442
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,619
TO HER 19 YEAR OLD SISTER

443
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,621
WHO WENT DOWN TO THE U.S.S.NIMITZ

444
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,124
AND SOLD OVER 2,000 BOXES.

445
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,128
HEY, HOW'D THE INTERVIEW GO?

446
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,129
OH, I BLEW IT.

447
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,131
I WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN HIRED ME.

448
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,633
OH, COME HERE, SWEETIE.

449
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,136
LISTEN, YOU'RE GOING TO GO ON

450
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,139
LIKE, A THOUSAND INTERVIEWS BEFORE YOU GET A JOB.

451
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,647
THAT'S NOT HOW THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO COME OUT.

452
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,150
THIS IS JUST THE WORST CHRISTMAS EVER.

453
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,152
YOU KNOW WHAT, RACH? MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST

454
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,153
STAY HERE AT THE COFFEE HOUSE.

455
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,654
I CAN'T. IT'S TOO LATE.

456
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,157
TERRY ALREADY HIRED THAT GIRL OVER THERE.

457
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,159
LOOK AT HER.

458
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,661
SHE'S EVEN GOT WAITRESS EXPERIENCE.

459
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,662
OOH!

460
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,165
LAST NIGHT SHE WAS... TEACHING EVERYBODY

461
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:30,669
HOW TO MAKE NAPKINS INTO...

462
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,171

463
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,175
THAT WORD WAS "SWANS."

464
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,682
WELL, SEEING THAT DRUNK SANTA WET HIMSELF

465
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,684
REALLY PERKED UP MY CHRISTMAS.

466
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,194
OH, MY GOD!

467
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,196
MERRY CHRISTMAS! MERRY CHRISTMAS!

468
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,697
OH!

469
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,200
YOU SAVED THEM! YOU GUYS!

470
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,202
OH, GOD, YOU'RE THE BEST!

471
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,205
IT'S LIKE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD CHRISTMAS TREES.

472
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:10,209

473
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,210
HELLO?

474
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,712
YEAH, THIS IS SHE.

475
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,214
OH!

476
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,215
YOU'RE KIDDING.

477
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,716
YOU'RE KIDDING!

478
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,717
OH, THANK YOU!

479
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,219
I LOVE YOU!

480
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,721
SURE, EVERYBODY LOVES A KIDDER.

481
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,223
I GOT THE JOB!

482
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,726
ALL RIGHT! THAT'S GREAT.

483
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,229
GOD BLESS US, EVERY ONE.

484
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,732
HERE WE GO.

485
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,235
I'M SERVING MY LAST CUP OF COFFEE.

486
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:40,739

487
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,744
THERE YOU GO.

488
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,246
ENJOY.

489
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,250
SHOULD I TELL HER I ORDERED TEA?

490
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,752
NO.

491
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,254
UM, EXCUSE ME, EVERYONE.

492
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,757
UH, THIS IS MY LAST NIGHT WORKING HERE

493
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,260
AND, UH, I JUST WANTED TO SAY

494
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,263
THAT I MADE SOME REALLY GOOD FRIENDS HERE

495
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,266
AND, UH, IT'S JUST TIME TO MOVE ON.

496
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,773
UH, NO OFFENSE TO EVERYBODY WHO, UH, STILL WORKS HERE

497
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,777
BUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW GOOD IT FEELS TO SAY

498
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,779
THAT AS OF THIS MOMENT

499
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:25,784
I WILL NEVER HAVE TO MAKE COFFEE AGAIN.

500
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,787
NOW, MR. KAPLAN SR. LIKES HIS COFFEE STRONG

501
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,289
SO YOU WANT TO USE TWO BAGS

502
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,291
INSTEAD OF ONE, SEE?

503
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,294
NOW, PAY ATTENTION, BECAUSE THIS PART'S TRICKY.

504
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,797
SEE, SOME PEOPLE USE FILTERS JUST ONCE.

505
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,309
UM, I'M SORRY YOU DIDN'T GET TO GO TO SPACE CAMP

506
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,311
BUT I'M HOPING THAT MAYBE, SOMEHOW

00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,847

520
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:32,351

521
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,853
I'M AN ALIEN. I'M AN ALIEN.

522
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,856
OH, NO, AN ASTEROID!

523
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,858
