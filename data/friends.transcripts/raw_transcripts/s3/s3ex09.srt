1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,004
YES! YES!

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,505

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,507
HEY, IT'S YOUR THANKSGIVING TOO.

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,510
YOU KNOW, INSTEAD OF WATCHING FOOTBALL, YOU COULD HELP.

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,513
WE KNOW. WE KNOW. WE KNOW.

6
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,016
RACHEL, YOU WANT TO PUT THE MARSHMALLOWS

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,517
IN CONCENTRIC CIRCLES.

8
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:22,022
NO, MON, YOU WANT TO PUT THEM IN CONCENTRIC CIRCLES.

9
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,024
I WANT TO DO THIS.

10
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,036
EVERY YEAR.

24
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,085
 GO, GO, GO. YES!

25
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,087
FOR ONCE, I AM GOING TO SIT DOWN

26
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,589
AND TRY TO WATCH ONE OF THESE THINGS.

27
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,093
 HALF TIME.

28
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,594
 HEY, WHO WANTS TO THROW

29
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,096
THE BALL AROUND A LITTLE?

30
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,098
MAYBE GET A LITTLE THREE ON THREE GOING.

31
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,100
OH, THAT WOULD BE SO MUCH FUN.

32
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,101
OH, CAN I PLAY, TOO?

33
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,603
I'VE NEVER PLAYED FOOTBALL, LIKE, EVER.

34
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,105
GREAT. YOU CAN COVER CHANDLER.

35
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,609
NO, NO, I DON'T REALLY WANT TO PLAY.

36
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,611
COME ON, MAN, YOU NEVER WANT TO DO ANYTHING

37
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,113
SINCE YOU AND JANICE BROKE UP.

38
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,114
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

39
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,615
I WANTED TO WEAR MY BATHROBE

40
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,117
AND EAT PEANUT CLUSTERS ALL DAY.

41
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,619
I WANTED TO START DRINKING IN THE MORNING.

42
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,121
DON'T SAY THAT I DON'T HAVE GOALS.

43
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,623
CHANDLER, YOU HAVE TO START GETTING OVER HER, ALL RIGHT?

44
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,625
IF YOU PLAY, YOU GET SOME FRESH AIR.

45
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,128
MAYBE YOU'LL TAKE YOUR MIND OFF JANICE.

46
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,630
AND IF YOU DON'T PLAY, EVERYONE'LL BE MAD AT YOU

47
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,132
BECAUSE THE TEAMS WON'T BE EVEN.

48
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,133
COME ON.

49
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,635
YEAH, ALL RIGHT. I'LL PLAY

50
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,138
BUT I DON'T LIKE... YOU.

51
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,140
YAY! LET'S DO IT!

52
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,641
ROSS?

53
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,642
WHAT?

54
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,145
WANT TO PLAY FOOTBALL?

55
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,147
UM, MONICA AND I

56
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,150
AREN'T SUPPOSED TO PLAY FOOTBALL.

57
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,652
SAYS WHO, YOUR MOM?

58
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,654
YEAH. YES.

59
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,159
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?" SHE ASKS HER BOYFRIEND

60
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,660
REALLY SCARED TO HEAR THE ANSWER.

61
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,162
EVERY THANKSGIVING, UM

62
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,165
WE USED TO HAVE A TOUCH FOOTBALL GAME

63
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,167
CALLED THE GELLER BOWL.

64
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,669
NO, NO, YOU SAY THAT PROUDLY.

65
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,172
ANYWAY, ROSS AND I WERE ALWAYS CAPTAINS

66
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,175
AND, UM, IT GOT KIND OF COMPETITIVE

67
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,177
AND ONE YEAR, GELLER BOWL VI

68
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:01,181
I ACCIDENTALLY BROKE ROSS'S NOSE.

69
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,684
IT WAS SONOTAN ACCIDENT.

70
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,186
SHE SAW I WAS ABOUT TO TAG HER

71
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:10,190
SO SHE THREW HER BIG, FAT GRANDMA ARM ELBOW IN MY FACE

72
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,191
JUST KEPT RUNNING.

73
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,692
YEAH.

74
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,694
TO SCORE THE WINNING TOUCHDOWN, BY THE WAY.

75
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,695
WHOA, WHOA, HELLO?

76
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,697
UH, YOU DID NOT WIN THE GAME.

77
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,199
THE TOUCHDOWN DIDN'T COUNT

78
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,201
BECAUSE OF THE SPECTACULARLY ILLEGAL--

79
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,205
AND BY THE WAY, SAVAGE-- NOSE BREAKING.

80
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,706
I WON THE GAME.

81
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,707
OH, YEAH?

82
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:31,211
THEN HOW COME YOU DIDN'T GET THE GELLER CUP?

83
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,214
THERE WAS A GELLER CUP?

84
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,717
YES. IT WAS THE TROPHY YOU GOT IF YOU WON THE GAME

85
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,719
BUT OUR DAD SAID NOBODY WON THAT GAME

86
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,221
AND HE WAS SICK OF OUR FIGHTING

87
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,722
SO HE TOOK THE TROPHY...

88
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,731
THREW IT IN THE LAKE.

89
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,734
AND WAS THE CURSE LIFTED?

90
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,238
ANYWAY...

91
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,739
THAT'S WHEN MOM SAID

92
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,741
WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO PLAY FOOTBALL AGAIN.

93
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,743
YOU KNOW WHAT?

94
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,745
I THINK WE SHOULD PLAY A GAME.

95
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,247
I MEAN, COME ON, IT'S BEEN 12 YEARS.

96
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,749
CAN I SEE YOU FOR A SECOND?

97
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,254

98
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,755
WUSS!

99
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,758
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO PLAY.

100
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,759
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE, THOUGH.

101
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,760
HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THERE

102
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,762
BECAUSE MY MOM WON'T LET ME CROSS THE STREET.

103
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,766
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

104
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,767
HEY!

105
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,768
HEY!

106
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,769
HERE WE GO.

107
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,271
ALL RIGHT, PHEEBS.

108
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,772
OKAY, LET'S BRING IT IN.

109
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,275
HONEY, HONEY, THROW IT TO ME, THROW IT TO ME.

110
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,277

111
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,779
THAT ALMOST HIT ME IN THE FACE.

112
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,781
 ALL RIGHT

113
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,283
WE HAVE TO PICK CAPTAINS.

114
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,285
AND THEN TENNILLES.

115
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,788
OKAY, SO HOW DO WE DECIDE THAT?

116
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,290
WELL, WHY DON'T WE JUST BUNNY UP?

117
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,291
 WHAT?

118
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,294
 BUNNY!

119
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,295
OKAY, LOOKS LIKE

120
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,796
ROSS AND I ARE CAPTAINS.

121
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,798
THERE MUST BE A SPECIAL PLACE IN HEAVEN

122
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,301
FOR PEOPLE THAT HUNG OUT WITH YOU TWO IN HIGH SCHOOL.

123
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,802
OKAY, SO I BUNNIED FIRST

124
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,305
WHICH MEANS I GET TO PICK FIRST.

125
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,306
JOEY. THANK YOU.

126
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,807
MONICA...

127
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,809
I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND.

128
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,311
SWEETIE, DON'T WORRY.

129
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,312

00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,814

131
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,317

132
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,318
PHOEBE.

133
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,323
SWEETIE, NOW I PICK YOU.

134
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,824
YOU DON'T PICK ME.

135
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,327
YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME.

136
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,328
OKAY.

137
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,829

00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,334
TWO HAND TOUCH. WE'LL KICK OFF.

141
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,835
 ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE, LISTEN.

142
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,337
I'VE GOT EXACTLY 28 MINUTES

143
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,339
BEFORE I HAVE TO BASTE AGAIN.

144
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,841
WOW, JUST LIKE IN THE PROS.

145
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,843

OKAY, SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS REALLY THINK OF CHANDLER?

00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,858
YEAH.

152
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,860
OKAY. ALL RIGHT, JOEY'S GOING TO CATCH IT

153
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,362
AND YOU AND I ARE GOING TO BLOCK.

154
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,363
WHAT'S BLOCK?

155
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,365
PHOEBE, I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

156
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,368
I THOUGHT YOU MEANT IN LIFE.

157
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,870
BREAK.

158
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,873
THE BALL IS JANICE, THE BALL IS JANICE.

159
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,379
OW! OW!

160
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,381
OH, SON OF A...! OW!

161
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,382
COME ON.

162
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,883
SORRY. I'M SORRY.

163
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,884
YOU KNOW WHAT--

164
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,387
WE'RE JUST GOING TO THROW IT.

165
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,895
YES!

166
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,398

00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,400
 YES! SCORE!

168
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,902

00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,404
OKAY, HONEY

170
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,406
JUST SO THAT I'M CLEAR ON THIS

171
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,908
NOW YOU SAID IN THE HUDDLE THAT IF JOEY CAUGHT THE BALL

172
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,410
YOU WERE GOING TO BE THE ONE TO STOP HIM.

173
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,912
NOW YOU DIDN'T, SO IS THAT LIKE A LIKE A FOOTBALL STRATEGY?

174
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,416
YEAH, IT WAS PART OF MY PLAN TO FALL INSTANTLY BEHIND.

175
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,917
SO, COME ON, LET'S GO.

176
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,919
LOSERS WALK.

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,922
YEAH? LOSERS TALK.

00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,424
NO. ACTUALLY, LOSERS RHYME.

179
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,925
ALL RIGHT.

180
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,430

181
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,934
YOU WANT TO GO SHOTGUN?

182
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,935

185
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,442
THREE MISSISSIPPI.

186
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,444
HA! I ALMOST CAUGHT THAT ONE.

187
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,945
YEAH, GREAT.

188
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,948
NOW THE SCORE'S SEVEN TO ALMOST SEVEN.

189
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,950
OKAY.

190
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,953
THIS PLAY, I WANT YOU TO DO A DOWN AND OUT TO THE RIGHT, OKAY?

191
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,954
 BREAK.

192
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,456
WAIT. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

193
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,457

194
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,958
YOU GO LONG.

195
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,959
HOW LONG?

196
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,462
UNTIL WE START TO LOOK VERY SMALL.

197
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,463
OKAY.

198
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,964

00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,979

00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,982
HEY, THANKS FOR STOPPING OUR BALL.

00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,984

00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,028
WOW.

00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,030
WOW, WHAT?

00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,534
IT AMAZES ME THAT YOU'RE STILL PULLING STUFF LIKE THIS.

232
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,535
PULLING WHAT?

233
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,536
IT'S SECOND DOWN.

234
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,538
OKAY, IT'S SECOND DOWN.

236
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,041

00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,042
I HEARD THAT.

238
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,044
WELL, I SAID IT LOUD.

239
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,548
IT IS OKAY IF I STAY AND WATCH?

240
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,550
I CAN'T GO HOME JUST YET.

241
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,052
MY ROOMMATE IS, UM...

242
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,556

00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,057
YEAH, STICK AROUND.

00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,560
WELL, THAT WENT WELL.

246
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,061
I THINK SO.

247
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,564
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING ABOUT ASKING HER FOR HER NUMBER.

248
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,067
THANKS, MAN, BUT I THINK IT MAKES A STRONGER STATEMENT

249
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,569
IF I ASK FOR IT MYSELF.

250
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,070
WHOA, OH.

251
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,572
NO, I WAS THINKING ABOUT FOR ME.

252
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,074
PART OF THAT WHOLE "GETTING OVER JANICE" THING

253
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,576

00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,578
OH, YEAH. THAT. ALL RIGHT.

255
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,581
IF IT MEANS THAT MUCH TO YOU, I'LL LET YOU HAVE HER.

256
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,582
THANKS.

257
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,084
"LET ME HAVE HER"?

258
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,586
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

259
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,088
LIKE, IF YOU DIDN'T, I WOULDN'T HAVE A SHOT?

260
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,090
I DON'T LIKE TO SAY IT OUT LOUD

261
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,592
BUT...

262
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,093

WE ALL HAVE OUR STRENGTHS.

265
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,598
YOU'RE BETTER WITH NUMBERS AND STUFF.

266
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,099

270
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,605
FORGET ABOUT IT.

271
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,606

272
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,107

273
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,112

279
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,121
WELL, UH...

282
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,128

00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,651
WELL, NOW YOU HAVE TWO.

294
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,154
HEY, I AM GOOD AT MATH.

00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,155
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,657
YOU KNOW, I WAS STILL GOING TO LET YOU HAVE HER

297
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:58,658
BUT NOW FORGET ABOUT IT.

298
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,159
PREPARE TO FEEL VERY BAD ABOUT YOURSELF.

299
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,163
HEY, WELL, I'VE BEEN PREPARING FOR THAT MY ENTIRE LIFE.

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,672
42, 38, HIKE.

305
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:13,673

306
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,174
OOH, I GOT IT.

307
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,175

00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,177

00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,187
NO, NO, NO.

314
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,689
UH, HELLO. THE BUZZER BUZZED.

315
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,690
IT DOESN'T COUNT.

316
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,191
AFTER THE SNAP.

317
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,192
BEFORE THE SNAP.

318
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,193
AFTER. BEFORE.

319
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,194
NOW, DOES IT REALLY MATTER?

320
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,195
 YES!

321
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,196
BUT, OKAY.

322
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,698
I MADE A TOUCHDOWN.

00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,200
PHEEBS, THAT'S GREAT.

325
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,201
IT DOESN'T COUNT.

326
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,202
DOES SO COUNT.

327
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,705
CHEATER, CHEATER, COMPULSIVE EATER.

328
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,206

329
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,209
OH, MY GOD.

330
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,711
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S FINE.

331
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,213
MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T GROWN UP, BUT I HAVE.

332
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,214
OH, OKAY.

333
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,717
DEAD LEG!

00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,218
OKAY, OKAY, FINE, FINE, ALL RIGHT.

335
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,720
YOU WANT TO WIN BY CHEATING?

336
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,220
GO AHEAD, ALL RIGHT?

337
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,222
PHOEBE, THE TOUCHDOWN DOES COUNT.

338
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,223
YOU WIN.

339
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,224
OH, YAY. NO.

340
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,226

341
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,227
WITH YOU AGAIN, OKAY.

342
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,730
JUST ONCE, I WANT TO BEAT YOU WHEN YOU CAN'T BLAME IT

343
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,231
ON THE BROKEN NOSE OR THE BUZZER

344
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,234
OR THE FACT YOU THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE GETTING MONO.

345
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,736
ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST CALL THIS

346
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,238
TIE SCORE AND IT'S HALF TIME.

347
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,240
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T PLAY WITH CHEATERS

348
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,743
AND SECOND OF ALL, YOU KNOW I HAD SWOLLEN GLANDS.

349
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,746
YOU KNOW WHAT?

350
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,247
I THINK YOU'LL PLAY.

351
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,248
OH, REALLY?

352
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,750
WHY IS THAT?

353
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,752
BECAUSE THE WINNER GETS THIS.

354
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,254
THE GELLER CUP.

355
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,258
IS EVERYBODY ELSE SEEING A TROLL DOLL

356
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,260
NAILED TO A 2 x 4?

357
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,261

358
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,764
OKAY, GOOD.

359
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,769
OKAY, WHERE THE HELL DID YOU GET THAT?

360
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,270
WHEN MOM AND DAD DROVE YOU

361
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,272
TO THE HOSPITAL TO GET YOUR NOSE FIXED

362
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,274
I SWAM INTO THE LAKE AND FISHED IT OUT.

363
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,275
THAT CUP IS MINE.

364
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,277
NO, IT'S NOT. YOU WANT IT...

365
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,279
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WIN IT.

366
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,282
ALL RIGHT, SO ARE WE NOT HAVING DINNER AT ALL?

367
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,285
HEY, COULD YOU COULD YOU PLEASE SET THE TIMER, MARGHA?

00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,287
OKAY, PEE PHEE.

00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,290

370
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,291
COME ON, PHOEBE, LET'S GO.

371
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,292
IT'S TIME TO GET SERIOUS.

372
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,294
HUDDLE UP.

373
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,296
JOEY, KEEP YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME.

374
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,798
IT'S HARD, YOU KNOW?

375
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,800
HIS HUDDLE'S CLOSER TO THE DUTCH GIRL.

376
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,803
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, IF I TAKE CHANDLER OUT OF THE RUNNING

377
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,304
WILL YOU BE ABLE TO FOCUS?

378
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,806
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

379
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,808
YOU JUST MAKE SURE HE CATCHES THE BALL.

380
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,309
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE REST.

381
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,310
OKAY. BREAK.

382
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,311

00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,331

403
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,867

LIKE THE TURKEY, ROSS IS DONE!

414
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,903
IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT YOU'RE WINNING

415
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,406
BECAUSE YOU GOT TO PICK FIRST, SO YOU GOT THE BETTER TEAM.

416
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,407
YOU'RE SO PATHETIC.

417
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,408
WHY CAN'T YOU ACCEPT IT?

418
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,911
WE'RE WINNING BECAUSE I'M BETTER THAN YOU.

419
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,412

420
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,915
OH, WHAT A GREAT ARGUMENT-- EXHALING.

421
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,916
YOU KNOW WHAT?

422
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,417
I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU, OKAY?

423
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,419
I'LL TRADE YOU JOEY FOR RACHEL

424
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,421
AND I'LL STILL WIN THE GAME.

425
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,923
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

426
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,425
THERE GOES MY LAST SHRED OF SELF ESTEEM.

427
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,928
WHAT? WHA...? THE GUYS AGAINST THE GIRLS?

428
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,930
SEE, THAT'S RIDICULOUS, MONICA

429
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,933
BECAUSE I'M ONLY DOWN BY THREE TOUCHDOWNS.

430
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,934
OH... THEN BRING IT ON.

431
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,435
OH, UNLESS, OF COURSE

432
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,938
YOU'RE AFRAID YOU MIGHT LOSE TO A BUNCH OF GIRLS.

433
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,940

434
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,941
FINE, FINE.

435
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,943
RACHEL, YOU'RE WITH MONICA.

436
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,444
JOEY, YOU'RE WITH ME.

437
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,446
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU ARE TRADING ME.

438
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,948
YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE

439
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:53,452
AND YOU ARE GOING TO... LOSE AND...

440
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,453
COME ON. HELP ME OUT HERE.

441
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,955
I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.

442
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,456
THAT'S GOOD-- LOSE.

443
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,457
...LOSE.

444
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,960
 COME ON, RACH. COME ON.

00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,464
YOU'RE GOING TO LET ME PLAY?

00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,967

00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,969
THE GAME IS OVER? WE EAT NOW?

449
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,970
NO, NO, NO. THE GAME'S NOT OVER.

450
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,471
WE'RE JUST SWITCHING TEAMS.

451
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,473
YEAH, CHANDLER FINDS ME SO INTIMIDATING

452
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,475

453
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,977
RIGHT, OKAY, LET'S PLAY.

454
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,978

00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,099

00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,104
WE HAVE NO TIME, AND WE ARE LOSING.

510
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,105
WE ARE LOSING TO GIRLS.

511
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,107
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LOSE TO GIRLS.

512
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,608
HEY, IT'S 42 TO 21.

00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:34,113
I WAS JUST UP BY THAT MUCH.

515
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,615
LOOK, LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY--

516
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,118
IF WE LOSE, THEY WILL NEVER LET US FORGET IT, OKAY?

517
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,619
AND WORSE THAN THAT

518
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,122
THEY'LL NEVER LET THE WOMEN YOU DATE FORGET IT.

519
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,124
HEY, ARE WE PLAYING FOOTBALL OR WHAT?

520

WE ARE PLAYING FOR WOMEN EVERYWHERE.

523
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,133
OKAY, JUST THINK ABOUT EVERY LOUSY DATE YOU EVER HAD, OKAY?

524
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,135
EVERY GUY WHO KEPT ONE EYE ON THE TV

00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,636
WHILE YOU WERE MAKING OUT.

526
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:01,140

WELL, NO, I WANT TO KILL THEM, TOO

533
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,652
BUT THEY'RE BOYS.

534
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,656
YOU KNOW, HOW ARE WE GOING TO BEAT THREE BOYS?

535
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:21,660

536
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,687
WE STILL HAVE A MINUTE AND A HALF LEFT TO GO

537
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,189
AND WE'RE DOWN BY TWO POINTS, OKAY?

538
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,690
TWO POINTS, LADIES.

539
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,692

540
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,698

00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,706

COME ON, I AM NOT LAME, OKAY?

00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,742
NO, I'M NOT OKAY.

567
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,744
I'M SORRY. THEY WERE JUST ALL COMING AT ME

568
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,746
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

569
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,748
30 SECONDS LEFT ON THE TIMER.

570
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,250
WHOO HOO!

571
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,752
? YOU ARE THE LOSER ?

572
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,254
? DAH DAH, DAH, DAH DAH DAH. ?

573
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,257
OKAY, SO WE GET TO TAKE THAT, UH, STUPID TROLL THING HOME.

574
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,758
NO, YOU DON'T. COME ON, COME ON, HURRY.

575
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,260
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

576
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,761
HUDDLE UP.

577
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,762
OKAY.

578
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,764
OH...

579
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,267
OH, THIS IS OUR LAST HUDDLE.

580
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,268
ALL RIGHT...

581
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,769
PHOEBE, GET OPEN.

582
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,771
RACHEL... GO LONG.

583
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,273
OKAY.

584
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,274
BREAK.

585
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,280

586
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,822

587
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,823
I SCORED A TOUCHDOWN!

588
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,325
WE DID IT! WE WIN!

589
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,826
TOUCHDOWN! WHOO!

590
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,827
WE WIN!

591
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,828
YES!

592
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,331
YOU KNOW, RACHEL, FUNNY THING...

593
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,333
ACTUALLY, THE END ZONE STARTS AT THAT POLE

594
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,335
SO YOU'RE FIVE FEET SHORT, SO...

595
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,336

596
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,837
WEWIN.

597
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,838
WHOO!

598
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,839
YES! YES, YES, YES...

599
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,840
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT

600
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,343
SO, EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO ME, THOUGH.

601
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,844
IF NOBODY TAGGED RACHEL

602
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,847
THEN ISN'T THE PLAY STILL GOING?

603
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,851
I GOT IT! I GOT IT! I GOT IT!

604
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,852
LET GO! LET GO!

605
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,853
TOUCHDOWN, BUDDY. WE WIN.

606
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,355
NO WAY! LET GO!

607
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,858
LET GO? I'M A TINY LITTLE WOMAN.

608
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:40,859
GUYS, GUYS, COME ON.

609
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,860
IT'S THANKSGIVING.

610
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,363
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT WHO WINS OR LOSES.

611
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,864
THE IMPORTANT THING IS

612
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,866
THE DUTCH GIRL PICKED ME.

613
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,870
ME, NOT YOU. HOLLAND LOVES CHANDLER.

614
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,872
THANK YOU AMSTERDAM! GOOD NIGHT!

615
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:01,380
MMM! WE SHOULD DEFINITELY PLAY FOOTBALL MORE OFTEN.

616
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,882
MAYBE THERE'S LIKE A LEAGUE WE COULD JOIN OR SOMETHING.

617
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,384
ISN'T THERE, LIKE

618
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,886
A NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE?

619
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:08,887
YES. YES, THERE IS.

620
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,390
THEY PLAY ON SUNDAYS AND MONDAY NIGHTS.

621
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,891
OH, SHOOT.

622
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,393
I WORK MONDAY NIGHTS.

623
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,894
OH...

624
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,896
MM. THIS STUFFING IS AMAZING.

625
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,899
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BRING THEM SOME?

626
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,901
WHEN THEY'RE HUNGRY ENOUGH, THEY'LL COME IN.

627
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,902
LET GO!

628
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:24,903
NO, YOU LET GO!

629
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:25,904
NO!

630
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,908
HOW COME IT'S ALWAYS US LEFT ON THE FIELD

631
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:30,909
HOLDING THE BALL?

632
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,411
I DON'T KNOW.

633
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:36,415
GUESS THE OTHER PEOPLE JUST DON'T CARE ENOUGH.

634
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,918

635
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,422
HEY, IT'S STARTING TO SNOW.

636
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,424
AHH...

637
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,428
GIVE IT TO ME! LET GO! GIVE IT!

638
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,935
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A TIME TONIGHT

639
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,937
THAT I STARTED LOSING THE FEELING IN MY TOES.

640
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,439
I KNOW.

641
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,440
THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED

642
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,941
THERE'S MORE IMPORTANT THINGS

643
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,943
THAN BEATING YOU AT FOOTBALL.

644
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:05,944
THINGS LIKE FEET.

645
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,446
YEAH, I KNOW.

646
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,948
THIS THING HAS CAUSED US TOO MUCH PAIN AND SUFFERING.

647
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,949
YEAH.

648
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,451
IT'S TIME.

649
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,452
WE'LL JUST CALL IT A TIE.

650
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,453
IT'S A TIE.

651
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,455
ALL RIGHT.

652
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,457
OKAY.

653
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,958
OKAY.

654
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,963
GOOD NIGHT.

655
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,965
GOOD NIGHT.

656
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,469
PHEEBS, DID YOU GET IT?

657
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,970
 YEAH, I GOT IT.

658
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,472
GREAT! BRING IT UP.

659
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,476
THERE'S CHAMPAGNE IN MY APARTMENT FOR THE WINNERS.

660
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,977
 UH, ROSS...

661
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,479
WHAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN HERE?

662
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,982
 UH... NOTHING.
