1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,505
I DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND ANYMORE.

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,007
YOU WANT ME TO JUST QUIT MY JOB

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,009
SO YOU CAN FEEL LIKE YOU'VE GOT A GIRLFRIEND?

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,010
IS THIS ABOUT MARK?

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,011
OH, MY GOD!

6
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,012
OKAY, IT'S NOT.

7
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,014
OH, MY GOD. I CANNOT KEEP HAVING

8
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,016
THIS SAME FIGHT WITH YOU, ROSS.

9
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,018
LOOK, MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST TAKE A BREAK!

10
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,519
FINE, YOU'RE RIGHT.

11
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,520
LET'S, UH... LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

12
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,522
LET'S GET SOME FROZEN YOGURT.

13
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,523
NO...

14
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,526
A BREAK FROM US.

15
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,029
THEN WE HAD THIS

16
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,530
BIG, STUPID FIGHT

17
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,532
AND I SAID I WANTED TO TAKE A BREAK.

18
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,534
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE A BREAK.

19
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,036
I'VE BEEN THINKING THIS IS CRAZY.

20
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,537
Don't you think we can work on this?

21
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,039
HEY, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DRINK?

22
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,040
WHO'S THAT?

23
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,543
NOBODY?

24
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,544
IS THAT MARK?

25
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,046
HONEY, LOOK, HE JUST CAME OVER...

26
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,547
YEAH. GOT IT.

27
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,050
HEY! COME DANCE.

28
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,051
WHAT, ARE YOU MARRIED?

29
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,052

30
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,053
BECAUSE THAT'S OKAY.

31
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,569
HEY.

32
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,570
HEY.

33
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,572
HOW WAS THE BIG ANNIVERSARY DINNER?

34
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,573
WELL...

35
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,575
WE NEVER ACTUALLY GOT TO DINNER.

36
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,577
WHOA... NICE.

37
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,081
NO, WE KIND OF BROKE UP INSTEAD.

38
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,082
WHAT?!

39
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,083

40
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,584
WHAT?!

41
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,087
OH, MY GOD!

42
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,588
MONICA, IT'S ON THE CEILING!

43
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,589
THAT'S OKAY.

44
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,592
THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN FRUIT...

45
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,095
ON MY CEILING.

46
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,096
YOU BROKE UP?

47
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,597
YEAH, BUT IT'S OKAY

48
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,599
BECAUSE WHEN ROSS LEFT, MARK CAME OVER.

49
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,600
OH, NO!

50
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,601
RACHEL, YOU AND MARK?

51
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,602
NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.

52
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,603
CALM DOWN.

53
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,105
MARK AND I TALKED

54
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,608
AND I REALIZED HOW MUCH I LOVE YOUR STUPID BROTHER

55
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,609
AND...

56
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,111
YEAH, WE GOT OUR PROBLEMS

57
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,613
BUT I REALLY WANT TO MAKE IT WORK.

58
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,132
MORNING.

59
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:27,147
?  ?

60
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,649
?  ?

61
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,152
?  ?

62
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,655
?  ?

63
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,658
?  ?

64
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,661
?  ?

65
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,665
?  ?

66
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,667
?  ?

67
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,670
?  ?

68
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,672
?  ?

69
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,175
?  ?

70
00:02:55,175 --> 00:03:02,182
?  ?

71
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,687

72
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,688
 Hi. It's me.

73
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,690
I've been trying to reach you all night.

74
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,691
I feel awful.

75
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,693
Please, Ross, you've got to know

76
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,695
there's nothing between me and Mark.

77
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,697
This whole breakup thing is just stupid.

78
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,699
YEAH!

79
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,202
I'm just so sorry I put you through it.

80
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,704
And I I, you know, I don't want to get back together

81
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:25,705
over a machine...

82
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,707
UH UH.

83
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,708
I love you.

84
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,709
I LOVE YOU.

85
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,711
And you know what?

86
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,712
I'm going to go to bed now

87
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,714
but on my way to work tomorrow morning

88
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,716
I'm going to stop by around 8:30.

89
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,717
Bye.

90
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,718

91
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,222
CHLOE! CHLOE, HOW'S IT COMING?

92
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,225
HEY, WHAT KIND OF PUPPY DO YOU THINK I SHOULD GET?

93
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,726
UM, HEY, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

94
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,727
HOW ABOUT A BIG ONE?

95
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:48,728
MY APARTMENT'S...

96
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,729
THEN A SMALL ONE.

97
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:50,730
LISTEN, LET'S...

98
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,232
WE KIND OF HAVE TO GET GOING.

99
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,733
WAIT! WHERE'S MY SHOES?

100
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,235
YOUR... YOU NEED SHOES?

101
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,737
OKAY.

102
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,239
DO I KNOW WHY WE'RE RUSHING?

103
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,740
YEAH. YOU KNOW THE GIRLFRIEND

104
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,741
I TOLD YOU ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

105
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,243
WELL, IT TURNS OUT THAT SHE...

106
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,245
SHE WANTS TO GET BACK TOGETHER WITH ME.

107
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,246
OH, I FOUND IT!

108
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,747
THAT'S SO GREAT FOR YOU GUYS!

109
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,748
YEAH.

110
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,250
YOU MUST BE SO HAPPY.

111
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,751
YES. YES, I AM--

112
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,254
ONE OF THE MANY THINGS I'M FEELING.

113
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,255
WELL...

114
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,756
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

115
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,757
OH, THANK YOU.

116
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,259
AY! HEY...

117
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,760

118
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,264
RACHEL...!

119
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,768
OH, YOU GOT MY MESSAGE?

120
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,770
OH, AND YOU ARE RIGHT ON TIME.

121
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,771
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

122
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,273
CAN I BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND AGAIN?

123
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,275
YES, YOU CAN. VERY MUCH.

124
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,777
AH AH AH...

125
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,781
HEY.

126
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,782
HEY.

127
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,285
HEY, WHY ARE YOU MOPPING YOUR CEILING?

128
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,288
OH, THERE'S BANANA ON IT.

129
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,290
WOW. I HAVE THE SPIRIT OF AN OLD INDIAN WOMAN

130
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,791
LIVING IN MINE.

131
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,294
SO THEN YOU KNOW.

132
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,799
THE MAILMAN WAS DOWNSTAIRS, SO I BROUGHT UP YOUR MAIL.

133
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,800
OH, GOOD. THANKS.

134
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,802
NOW, WHAT IS "FABUTEK"?

135
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,803
OKAY...

136
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,306
ALL RIGHT, DON'T JUDGE ME TOO MUCH, OKAY?

137
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,309
BUT I SAW THIS INFOMERCIAL, AND I SWEAR TO YOU

138
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,811
I'VE NEVER, EVER BOUGHT ANYTHING ON TV BEFORE...

139
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,313
EXCEPT FOR THIS MOP.

140
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,814
BUT THERE WAS THIS STUFF

141
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,815
ON LEG WAXING.

142
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,317
IT LOOKED SO AMAZING...

143
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,818
WAXINE!

144
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,320
YES! HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

145
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,321
OH! IT'S INCREDIBLE!

146
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,323
I SO WANT TO BE A WAXINE GIRL!

147
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,824
I KNOW!

148
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,827
GOD... DO YOU THINK IT REALLY DOESN'T HURT?

149
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,329
BECAUSE HOW CAN THEY DO THAT?

150
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,331
HELLO? "ORGANIC SUBSTANCES RECENTLY DISCOVERED

151
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,333
IN THE DEPTHS OF THE RAIN FOREST"?

152
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,335
THEY HAVE THE BEST STUFF IN THERE.

153
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,838
OH, MY GOD.

154
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,342
OH, MY GOD.

155
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,344
YEAH, WE FIGURED WHEN WE COULDN'T FIND YOU

156
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,346
YOU'D GONE HOME TO MAKE UP WITH RACHEL

157
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,848
WHICH IS PROBABLY WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE

158
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,849
HUH?

159
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,351
YOU THINK?!

160
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,853
GOD, I...

161
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,854
I'M IN HELL.

162
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,356
I MEAN, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

163
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,858
RACHEL'S ALL, LIKE, "I LOVE YOU" AND "LET'S WORK ON THIS."

164
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,361
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS, WHAT IS SHE GOING TO DO?

165
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,863
WHAT IS SHE GOING TO SAY WHEN I TELL HER WHAT I DID?

166
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,365
WELL, BEFORE WE ANSWER THAT

167
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,368
I THINK WE SHOULD ADDRESS THE MORE IMPORTANT QUESTION--

168
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,369
HOW DUMB ARE YOU?

169
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,871
WHAT?

170
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,374
LOOK, WE'RE TRYING TO REBUILD A RELATIONSHIP HERE.

171
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,375
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THAT

172
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,877
WITHOUT BEING TOTALLY HONEST WITH EACH OTHER?

173
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,379
ROSS, LOOK

174
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,881
I'M ON BOARD ABOUT THE "TOTAL HONESTY" THING-- I AM.

175
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,885
JUST NOT ABOUT STUFF THAT'S GOING TO GET YOU IN TROUBLE.

176
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,887
HE'S RIGHT-- NOBODY'S GOING TO BENEFIT

177
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,389
AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HURT HER.

178
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,891
AND THERE WON'T BE A RELATIONSHIP LEFT TO REBUILD.

179
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,393
YEAH, BUT DON'T YOU...?

180
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,395
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, IF YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO TELL HER

181
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,397
AT LEAST WAIT TILL THE TIMING'S RIGHT.

182
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,399
AND THAT'S WHAT DEATH BEDS ARE FOR.

183
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,902
YEAH, OKAY.

184
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,404
ALL RIGHT.

185
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,406
OKAY, NOW, WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE

186
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,409
SHE DOESN'T FIND OUT SOME OTHER WAY.

187
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,911
DID YOU THINK ABOUT THE TRAIL?

188
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,915
WHAT TRAIL?

189
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,418
THE TRAIL

190
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,420
FROM THE WOMAN YOU DID IT WITH

191
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,922
TO THE WOMAN YOU HOPE NEVER FINDS OUT

192
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,424
YOU DID IT.

193
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,426
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE TRAIL!

194
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,928
NO, I DON'T THINK

195
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,430
THERE'S ANY TRAIL.

196
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,931
OKAY. OKAY, OKAY.

197
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,934
UH, CHLOE WORKS WITH THAT GUY ISAAC

198
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,935
ISAAC'S SISTER IS JASMINE

199
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,938
AND JASMINE WORKS AT THE MASSAGE PLACE WITH PHOEBE

200
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,441
AND PHOEBE'S FRIENDS WITH RACHEL, AND THAT'S THE TRAIL!

201
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,442
I DID IT!

202
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,946
"AFTER APPLYING THE WAXINE AND LINEN STRIPS

203
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,947
TO LEG NUMBER ONE..."

204
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,949
DID THAT. OKAY.

205
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,453
"...GRASP ONE OF THE LINEN STRIPS BY ITS EASY GRAB TAB

206
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,955
AND PULL IT OFF IN ONE QUICK PAIN FREE MOTION."

207
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:36,956
OKAY...

208
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,958
OWW!

209
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,462
IS IT NOT PAIN FREE?

210
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,464
NO! IT WAS PAINFUL!

211
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,966
OH, MY GOD, THEY SHOULD CALL IT

212
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,469
"PAINZEEN, NOW WITH A LITTLE WAX."

213
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,971
HUH. WELL, THE GIRLS IN THE SATIN NIGHTIES

214
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,972
ON THE COMMERCIAL

215
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,974
DON'T SEEM TO THINK IT'S THAT BAD.

216
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,977
THAT'S BECAUSE THEIR NERVES ARE PROBABLY DEADENED

217
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,479
FROM BEING SO STUPID.

218
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,482
BUT, HEY, YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME

219
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,483
PLEASE, BE MY GUEST.

220
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,987
OW! OW! OW! OW! OH, MY GOD!

221
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,990
NOW AREN'T YOU GLAD WE DIDN'T START

222
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,492
WITH THE BIKINI STRIPS?

223
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,499
CHLOE, HI.

224
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,001
IS THIS ABOUT ME TAKING YOUR WATCH?

225
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,003
YOU TOOK MY WATCH?

226
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,005
I'M SORRY. I DO THAT.

227
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,507
JUST... YOU KEEP IT.

228
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,009
LISTEN, DID YOU TELL ANYONE ABOUT US?

229
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,511
OH, NO.

230
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,012
I FEEL LIKE IT REALLY ISN'T

231
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,514
ANYBODY'S BUSINESS, YOU KNOW?

232
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,016
SO YOU DIDN'T MENTION ANYTHING TO ISAAC, RIGHT?

233
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,519
OH, WELL, I TELL ISAAC EVERYTHING.

234
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,021
OF COURSE YOU DO.

235
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,022
ISAAC...

236
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,023
HI, ISAAC.

237
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,024
ISAAC, HI.

238
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,526
WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY MET.

239
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,027
YOU DOG!

240
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,031
YES, I SUPPOSE I AM A DOG

241
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,034
BUT, ISAAC, SEE, I I HAPPEN TO HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

242
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,037
OH, RIGHT. THAT RACHEL CHICK FROM THE COFFEE PLACE.

243
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,038
YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE.

244
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,040
LISTEN, I DON'T WANT TO HURT HER.

245
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,542
OH, HEY, MAN, I KNOW.

246
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,044
DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH WE LOVE THEM.

247
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,046
MONOGAMY IS TOO CRUEL A RULE.

248
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,549
YEAH.

249
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:13,052
LISTEN, CAN YOU KEEP THIS INFORMATION TO YOURSELF?

250
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,554
OH, NO PROBLEM, DUDE.

251
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,055
WE GOT TO LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER.

252
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,057
WE'RE THE SAME, YOU AND ME.

253
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,563
ACTUALLY... NO, WE'RE NOT.

254
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,064
YEAH, WE ARE.

255
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,567
NO... WE'RE NOT.

256
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,068
YEAH, WE ARE.

257
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,571
NO, WE'RE NOT.

258
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,073
OKAY, WE'RE NOT. ALL RIGHT.

259
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,074
BUT WE ARE.

260
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,078
FINE. I JUST NEED TO KNOW

261
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,080
THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL YOUR SISTER.

262
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,584
I CAN PROMISE NOT TO TELL HERA GAIN.

263
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,588
JASMINE?

264
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,589
UH HUH.

265
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,591
WE MET AT PHOEBE'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

266
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,592
I'M ROSS GELLER.

267
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,094
YOU DID A BAD THING!

268
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,096
YES, I DID.

269
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,598
VERY BAD. VERY BAD.

270
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,099
VERY, VERY BAD.

271
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,601
I'M AGREEING WITH YOU.

272
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,104
DID YOU... LISTEN, DID YOU HAPPEN TO TELL PHOEBE YET?

273
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,105
NO.

274
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,106
OKAY, JASMINE

275
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,608
PLEASE... PLEASE DON'T.

276
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,110
I LOVE MY GIRLFRIEND VERY MUCH

277
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,612
AND I WANT MORE THAN ANYTHING

278
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,114
TO JUST WORK IT OUT WITH HER, OKAY?

279
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,117
ALL RIGHT.

280
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,118
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

281
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,121
BUT YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TALK TO MY ROOMMATE

282
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,624
BECAUSE I TOLD HIM, AND HE KNOWS PHOEBE, TOO.

283
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,125
WHO'S YOUR ROOMMATE?

284
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,627
GUNTHER...

285
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,128
GUNTHER, PLEASE TELL ME

286
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,631
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO RACHEL

287
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,133
ABOUT ME AND THE GIRL FROM THE COPY PLACE.

288
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,635
I'M SORRY.

289
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,637
WAS I NOT SUPPOSED TO?

290
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,152
OKAY, I GOT AN IDEA.

291
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,153
WHY DON'T YOU PULL OFF MINE

292
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,655
AND I PULL OFF YOURS?

293
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,658
OR YOU PULL OFF YOURS, AND I WILL LEAVE MINE ON

294
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,661
BECAUSE I THINK I CAN MAKE THIS LOOK WORK.

295
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,163
COME ON, PHOEBE, WE CAN DO THIS.

296
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,164
OH?

297
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,666
ALL RIGHT.

298
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,167
OKAY...

299
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,168
OW! OW!

300
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,169
OW! OW!

301
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,170
OW! OW!

302
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,672

303
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,174

304
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,676
 WE'RE ALL RIGHT.

305
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,177
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

306
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,178
WE'RE ALL RIGHT.

307
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,180
WE WERE JUST WAXING OUR LEGS.

308
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,682
OFF?!

309
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,186
FOR YOUR INFORMATION, THIS HAPPENS TO BE A PAIN

310
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,188
LIKE NO MAN WILL EVER EXPERIENCE.

311
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,190
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T THINK YOU CAN MAKE THAT STATEMENT

312
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,192
UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN KICKED IN AN AREA

313
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,195
THAT GOD ONLY MEANT TO BE TREATED NICELY.

314
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,698
I THINK WOMEN JUST HAVE A LOWER THRESHOLD FOR PAIN

315
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,699
THAN MEN, THAT'S ALL.

316
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,702
COME ON, IT'S JUST A LITTLE WAX.

317
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,703
OH, YEAH?

318
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,204
COME HERE.

319
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,206
OH, THAT'S MATURE.

320
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,207
OKAY, FINE.

321
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,208
SO, NOW WHAT?

322
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,210
I JUST PULL IT OFF?

323
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,212
THAT'S RIGHT. UH HUH.

324
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,216

325
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,722

326
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,224
OKAY, TIN MAN.

327
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,227
 COME ON, RACHEL.

328
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,730
COME ON. TALK TO ME,PLEASE.

329
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,231
 I CAN'T EVEN LOOK

330
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,233
AT YOU RIGHT NOW.

331
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,234
 WHAT?

332
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,736
NOTHING. NOTHING.

333
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,738
RACHEL SAID EVERYTHING WAS OKAY.

334
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,239
WHAT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT?

335
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,741
 RACHEL, I MADE...

336
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,743
JUST GET AWAY FROM ME!

337
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,244
I MADE A MISTAKE, OKAY?

338
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,746
"A MISTAKE"?!

339
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,248
WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO PUT IT IN-- HER PURSE?!

340
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,753
WHERE... WHERE DID HE PUT IT?

341
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,258
ROSS, YOU HAD SEX WITH ANOTHER WOMAN!

342
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,760
OH, MY GOD.

343
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,761
OH.

344
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,262
I KNEW SOMETHING HAD TO BE WRONG

345
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,764
BECAUSE MY FINGERNAILS

346
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,265
DID NOT GROW AT ALL YESTERDAY.

347
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,268
YEAH, WELL, I GUESS THEY HAD A FIGHT

348
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,770
AND HE GOT DRUNK...

349
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,271
YOU GUYS KNEW ABOUT THIS

350
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,773
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL US?!

351
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,774
HE HAD SEX

352
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,776
AND WE GET HIT ON OUR HEADS.

353
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,777
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

354
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,278
NO! NO! JUST GET OUT. NOW!

355
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,279
I WANT TO STAY.

356
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,280
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

357
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,281
OKAY.

358
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,282
ALL RIGHT.

359
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,784
HOW WAS SHE?

360
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,285
UH OH.

361
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,790
WHAT?

362
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,791
WAS SHE GOOD?

363
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,292
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

364
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,294
 COME ON, ROSS.

365
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,296
YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT.

366
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,798
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT!

367
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,799
HOW WAS SHE?

368
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,301
SHE WAS...

369
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,302
AWFUL.

370
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,303
HORRIBLE. SHE WAS NOT GOOD.

371
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,305
NOTHING COMPARED TO YOU.

372
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,808
SHE... SHE WAS DIFFERENT.

373
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,810
OH... UH OH.

374
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,813
GOOD. DIFFERENT?

375
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,816
NOBODY LIKES CHANGE... I...

376
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,818
YOU JUST STOP...

377
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,820
WHAT? OKAY, OKAY, OKAY-- OKAY.

378
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,822
SH SHOULD WE DO SOMETHING?

379
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,823
YEAH.

380
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,326
NEVER CHEAT ON RACHEL.

381
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,828
I'M SORRY, OKAY? I'M SORRY.

382
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,330
I WAS... I WAS DISGUSTED WITH MYSELF

383
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,332
AND THIS MORNING, I WAS SO... SO UPSET

384
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,334
AND THEN I GOT YOUR MESSAGE AND I WAS SO HAPPY

385
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,336
AND ALL I WANTED WAS TO GET HER

386
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,839
OUT OF MY APARTMENT AS FAST AS POSS...

387
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,341
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.

388
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,344
WHAT TIME DID YOUR LITTLE FRIEND LEAVE?

389
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,347
UH...

390
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,849
OH, MY GOSH.

391
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,852
SHE WAS THERE... SHE WAS STILL THERE?

392
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,354
SHE WAS IN THERE WHEN I WAS IN THERE?!

393
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,858
OH! JUST... GET... OUT!

394
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,361
LISTEN-- OH, HEY, HEY, THE IMPORTANT THING IS

395
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,363
SHE MEANT NOTHING TO ME.

396
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,365
AND YET SHE WAS WORTH JEOPARDIZING

397
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,867
OUR RELATIONSHIP!

398
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,368
LOOK, I DIDN'T THINK

399
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,870
THERE WAS A RELATIONSHIP

400
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,871
TO JEOPARDIZE.

401
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,372
I THOUGHT WE WERE BROKEN UP.

402
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,373
WE WERE ON A BREAK.

403
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,375
THAT, FOR ALL I KNEW, COULD LAST FOREVER.

404
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,377
THAT, TO ME, IS A BREAKUP.

405
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,880
YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS ON A TECHNICALITY?

406
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,882
LOOK, I'M NOT TRYING TO GET OUT OF ANYTHING, OKAY?

407
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,383
I THOUGHT OUR RELATIONSHIP WAS DEAD.

408
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,885
WELL, YOU SURE HAD

409
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,887
A HELL OF A TIME AT THE WAKE.

410
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,890
YOU KNOW WHAT?

411
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,391
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD LISTEN TO THIS ANYMORE.

412
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,893
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

413
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,894
WE CAN'T GO OUT THERE.

414
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,895
WHY NOT?

415
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,396
I'M HUNGRY.

416
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:01,400
BECAUSE THEY'LL KNOW WE'VE BEEN LISTENING.

417
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,904
GOD! AND TO HAVE TO HEAR ABOUT IT FROM GUNTHER!

418
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,405
COME ON, LIKE I WANTED HIM TO TELL YOU?

419
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,908
I RAN ALL OVER THE PLACE TRYING TO MAKE SURE

420
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,409
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

421
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,411
OH, THAT IS SO SWEET.

422
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:17,416
I THINK I'M FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU ALL OVER AGAIN.

423
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:19,919
YOU KNOW WHAT?

424
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,420
I THINK WE CAN GO OUT THERE.

425
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,422
THEY HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT.

426
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,423
YEAH, WE'LL BE FINE.

427
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,425
LOOK, RACHEL, I WANTED TO TELL YOU.

428
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,427
I THOUGHT I SHOULD, I DID

429
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,930
AND THEN CHANDLER AND JOEY CONVINCED ME NOT TO.

430
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,936
WAX THE DOOR SHUT.

431
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,938
WE'RE NEVER LEAVING, EVER.

432
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,440
HI. IT'S PHOEBE.

433
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,443
LISTEN, SOMEONE'S GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE MY 9:00 WITH MR. REHAK

434
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,946
BECAUSE IT'S, LIKE, 9:15 NOW, AND I'M NOT THERE.

435
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,451
NO, I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A HUGE RELATIONSHIP FIGHT.

436
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,953
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

437
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,454
IT'S NOT MINE.

438
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,956
DON'T YOU REALIZE

439
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,457
NONE OF THIS WOULD EVER HAVE HAPPENED

440
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,459
IF I DIDN'T THINK, AT THAT SAME MOMENT

441
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,460
YOU WERE HAVING SEX WITH MARK?

442
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,461
ALL RIGHT.

443
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,464
LET'S SAY I HAD SLEPT WITH MARK.

444
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,968
WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORGIVE ME?

445
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,972
YES, I WOULD.

446
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,978
YOU'D BE OKAY IF YOU KNEW THAT MARK HAD KISSED ME

447
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,480
AND BEEN NAKED WITH ME AND MADE LOVE TO ME?

448
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,984
YES.

449
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,988
IF YOU KNEW THAT OUR HOT, SWEATY, WRITHING BODIES...

450
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:29,989
LA LA LA LA

451
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,991
LA LA LA LA LA!

452
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,493
OKAY, OKAY, YEAH, IT...

453
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,995
I WOULD HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED

454
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,997
BUT...

455
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,499
I WOULD STILL WANT TO BE WITH YOU...

456
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,002
BECAUSE IT'S... I MEAN, IT'S YOU.

457
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,504
 AWW...

458
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,513
WHAT?

459
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,516
COME ON, RACH, TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

460
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,521
I'M THINKING...

461
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,026
I'M GOING TO ORDER A PIZZA.

462
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,530
ORDER A PIZZA, LIKE...

463
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,533
"I FORGIVE YOU"?

464
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,041
OH, MAN... PIZZA?

465
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,045
I LIKE PIZZA.

466
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,048
PUT OLIVES ON THE PIZZA.

467
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,554
WE COULD EAT THE WAX.

468
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,556
IT'S ORGANIC.

469
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,559
OH, GREAT-- FOOD WITH HAIR ON IT.

470
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,562
NO, NOT THE USED WAX.

471
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,065
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE CRAZY?

472
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,069
HEY, COULD I... COULD I GET IN ON THAT

473
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,571
BECAUSE I'M KIND OF HUNGRY MYSELF.

474
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,572
FINE.

475
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,075
HI. YES, I'D LIKE TO ORDER A LARGE PIZZA.

476
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,077
NO ANCHOVIES.

477
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,579
WITH EXTRA ANCHOVIES.

478
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,082
IT'S OKAY, I'LL JUST PICK THEM OFF.

479
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,583
AND COULD YOU PLEASE CHOP SOME UP

480
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,585
AND JUST PUT IT RIGHT THERE IN THE SAUCE?

481
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,593
YOU CAN HAVE THE LAST PIECE IF YOU WANT.

482
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,595
WELL, I SHOULD THINK SO.

483
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,097
YOU SLEPT WITH SOMEONE.

484
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,612
THEY'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS, AREN'T THEY?

485
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,615
YEAH. COME ON, IT'S ROSS AND RACHEL.

486
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,616
THEY'VE GOT TO.

487
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,120
WHAT IF THEY DON'T?

488
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,626
YOU THINK I NEED A NEW WALK?

489
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,131
WHAT?

490
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,134
WELL, YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN WALKING THE SAME WAY

491
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,635
SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

492
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,637
YOU KNOW HOW SOME GUYS-- THEY WALK INTO A ROOM

493
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,139
AND EVERYBODY TAKES NOTICE?

494
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,641
I THINK I NEED A TAKE NOTICE WALK.

495
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,644
ARE YOU ACTUALLY SAYING THESE WORDS?

496
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,652
WHAT, NOW YOU'RE NOT EVEN TALKING TO ME?

497
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,155
LOOK, RACHEL, I'M SORRY. OKAY?

498
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,158
I'M SORRY. I WAS OUT OF MY MIND.

499
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,159
I THOUGHT I'D LOST YOU.

500
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,660
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

501
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,662
COME ON, COME ON. HOW INSANE MUST I HAVE BEEN

502
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,165
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS? HUH?

503
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,666
I DON'T CHEAT. RIGHT?

504
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,668
THAT'S NOT ME. I'M NOT JOEY.

505
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,671
WHOA!

506
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,673
YEAH, OKAY.

507
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,180
HEY, IT'S 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

508
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,682
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE COME HOME YET.

509
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,186
YOU NOTICE HOW NEITHER ONE OF THEM ARE WONDERING WHERE I AM.

510
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,189
YEAH. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE CAN BE SO SELF INVOLVED.

511
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,192
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT?

512
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,693
I'M NOT... I'M NOT THE ONE THAT WANTED THAT...

513
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,195
THAT "BREAK," OKAY?

514
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,696
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT BAILED ON US.

515
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,198
YOU'RE THE ONE

516
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,200
THAT RAN THE MOMENT THINGS GOT JUST A LITTLE ROUGH.

517
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,701
THAT'S WHAT? THAT'S...

518
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,203
THAT IS NEITHER HERE NOR THERE.

519
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,704
OKAY, WELL, HERE WE ARE.

520
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,706
NOW WE'RE IN A TOUGH SPOT AGAIN, RACH.

521
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,707
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

522
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,209
HOW DO YOU WANT TO HANDLE IT?

523
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,710
DO YOU WANT TO FIGHT FOR US

524
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,713
OR DO YOU WANT TO BAIL?

525
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,215
LOOK, I...

526
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:21,720
I DID A TERRIBLE, STUPID, STUPID THING--

527
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,222
OKAY, AND I'M SORRY.

528
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,724
I WISH I COULD TAKE IT BACK, BUT I CAN'T.

529
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,727
I JUST CAN'T SEE US THROWING AWAY SOMETHING

530
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,229
WE KNOW IS SO DAMN GOOD.

531
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:34,233
RACHEL, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

532
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,743
NO, ROSS!

533
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,745
DON'T!

534
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,746
YOU CAN'T JUST KISS ME

535
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,748
AND THINK YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT ALL GO AWAY.

536
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,250
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

537
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,251
IT DOESN'T JUST

538
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,252
MAKE IT BETTER, OKAY?

539
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,253
OKAY, OKAY.

540
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,759
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO.

541
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,262
WHAT?

542
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,765
I REALLY THINK YOU NEED TO GO NOW.

543
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,768
OKAY, OKAY--

544
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,270
THIS MORNING, YOU SAID

545
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,772
THERE WAS NOTHING SO BIG THAT WE COULDN'T WORK

546
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,274
PAST IT TOGETHER.

547
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,276
WHAT THE HELL DID I KNOW?

548
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,279
LOOK, THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY WE CAN WORK PAST THIS, OKAY?

549
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,282
I CAN'T IMAGINE... I CAN'T IMAGINE MY LIFE WITHOUT YOU

550
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,284
YOU KNOW, WITHOUT...

551
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,787
WITHOUT THESE ARMS...

552
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,289

553
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,791
AND YOUR FACE AND YOUR HEART--

554
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,794
YOUR GOOD HEART, RACH, AND...

555
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,799
NO.

556
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,803
I CAN'T. YOU'RE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON TO ME NOW.

557
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,806
I USED TO THINK OF YOU AS SOMEBODY THAT WOULD NEVER

558
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,808
EVER, HURT ME. EVER.

559
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:55,814
GOD, AND NOW I JUST CAN'T STOP PICTURING YOU WITH HER.

560
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,817
I CAN'T. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU SAY OR WHAT

561
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,818
YOU DO, ROSS.

562
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,321
IT'S JUST CHANGED EVERYTHING.

563
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,325
FOREVER.

564
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,331

565
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,834
THIS...

566
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,836
THIS CAN'T BE IT.

567
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,338
I MEAN...

568
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,842

569
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,345
THEN HOW COME IT IS?

570
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,359
THEY'VE BEEN QUIET FOR A LONG TIME.

571
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,361
MAYBE SHE KILLED HIM.

572
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,866
LET'S GO.

573
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,396
IS THAT YOUR NEW WALK?

574
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,902
NO. I REALLY HAVE TO PEE.

575
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:27,906
