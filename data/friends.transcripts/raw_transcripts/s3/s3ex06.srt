1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,505
JANICE HAS A QUESTION: WHO OF THE SIX OF YOU

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:10,010
HAS SLEPT WITH WHO OF THE SIX OF YOU?

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,513
WOW, IT'S LIKE A DIRTY MATH PROBLEM.

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,016
UM, SORRY, THE ANSWER THERE WOULD BE:

5
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,517
NONE OF US.

6
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,019
YEAH. AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,020
IF THAT DOESN'T CHANGE SOON

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,522
I'M GOING TO DUMP YOU FOR SOMEBODY WHO PUTS OUT.

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,025
COME ON. OVER THE YEARS, NONE OF YOU EVER GOT

10
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,526
YOU KNOW, DRUNK AND STUPID?

11
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,529
WELL, THAT'S REALLY A DIFFERENT QUESTION.

12
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,530
I'M SORRY.

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,033
I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT A GROUP OF PEOPLE

14
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,036
WHO SPENDS AS MUCH TIME TOGETHER AS YOU GUYS DO

15
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,037
HAS NEVER BUMPED UGLIES.

16
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,539
THERE WAS THAT ONE TIME

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,541
THAT MONICA AND RACHEL GOT TOGETHER.

18
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,044
WHAT?!

19
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,045
EXCUSE ME.

20
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,546
THERE WAS NO "TIME."

21
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,048
OKAY, BUT LET'S SAY THERE WAS.

22
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,051
HOW MIGHT THAT GO?

23
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,553
OKAY, OKAY.

24
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,555
WELL, THEN ANSWER ME THIS.

25
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,557
HAVE ANY OF YOU EVER...

26
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,060
ALMOST?

27
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,565
 DOES ANYBODY NEED ANY MORE COFFEE?

28
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,067
 HEY, THERE'S A DOG OUT THERE.

41
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,616
OH, THAT IS SO UNFORTUNATE.

42
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,118
WHAT?

43
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,620
CUTE NAKED GUY'S REALLY STARTING TO PUT ON WEIGHT.

44
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,124
OKAY, I'LL BE BA CK IN JUST A MINUTE.

45
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,626
OH, PHOEBE, I'M SORRY

46
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,129
THAT I LEFT LIPSTICK MARKS ON THE PHONE.

47
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,630
YOU DIDN'T LEAVE LIPSTICK MARKS ON THE PHONE.

48
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,133
OH. THEN IT MUST HAVE BEEN YOU.

49
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,634
BYE.

50
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,138
BYE BYE.

51
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,639
THAT'S WHY I MOVED OUT.

52
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,141
HEY, YOU KNOW, WHILE WE'RE ON THAT

53
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,143
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO TELL MY SISTER

54
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,644
THAT YOU DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE?

55
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,646
I THINK ON SOME LEVEL SHE ALREADY KNOWS.

56
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,149
PHOEBE, SHE DOESN'T KNOW T YOU SNEAK OUT EVERY NIGHT

57
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,651
SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT  YOU SNEAK BACK EVERY MORNING

58
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,153
AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT THAT YOU'VE BEEN LIVING

59
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,155
AT YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S FOR A WEEK NOW.

60
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,657
OKAY, WELL, MAYBE NOT ON THOSE LEVELS.

61
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,159
YOU HAVE GOT TO TELL HER.

62
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,660
OKAY, THE LONGER YOU WAIT

63
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,662
THE HARDER IT'S GOING TO BE ON HER.

64
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,663
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.

65
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,165
ANYWAY, LISTEN.

66
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,167
TONIGHT'S BAG IS REALLY BULKY

67
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,170
SO COULD YOU SNEAK SOME STUFF OUT FOR ME?

68
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,672
IT'S JUST, LIKE, A CLOCK RADIO AND SOME CEMETERY DIRT.

69
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,176
HEY.

70
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,182
I'M NEVER GOING TO FIND A ROOMMATE EVER.

71
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,683
WHOA. NOBODY GOOD?

72
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,185
WELL, LET'S SEE.

73
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,687
THERE WAS THE GUY WITH THE FERRETS.

74
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,688
THAT'S PLURAL.

75
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,190
THE SPITTER.

76
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,192
OH, AND, YES, THE GUY WHO ENJOYED MY NAME SO MUCH

77
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,194
HE FELT HE NEEDED TO MAKE A LITTLE NOISE

78
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,695
EVERY TIME HE SAID IT.

79
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,197
"NICE TO MEET YOU, CHANDLER BING.

80
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,198
BING!"

81
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,200
"GREAT APARTMENT, CHANDLER BING.

82
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,202
BING!"

83
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,204
SO HOW MANY MORE DO YOU HAVE TOMORROW?

84
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,706
TWO. THIS PHOTOGRAPHER WHO SEEMS REALLY DULL

85
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,209
AND THIS ACTOR GUY, WHO I'M NOT SURE ABOUT

86
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,710
BECAUSE, UH, WHEN HE CALLED

87
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,712
AND I ANSWERED THE PHONE "CHANDLER BING"

88
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,215
HE SAID, "WHOA! SHORT MESSAGE."

89
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,717
 UH, ROSS?

90
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,718
FOOT ON THE FLOOR

91
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,720
OR COME OVER NO MORE.

92
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,722
SURE. YOUR DRESSER IS MISSING

93
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,724
BUT THIS SHE NOTICES.

94
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,725
WHAT?

95
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,727
I HAVE TO GO.

96
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,231
YEAH, CAROL SHOULD BE HOME BY NOW.

97
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,732
HMM. HOW'S IT GOING WITH YOU GUYS?

98
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,733
OH, BETTER, ACTUALLY.

99
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,236
YOU KNOW, I THINK I FINALLY FIGURED OUT

100
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,238
WHY WE WERE HAVING SO MUCH TROUBLE LATELY.

101
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,739
OH, REALLY?

102
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,241
YOU KNOW HOW I HAVE YOU GUYS?

103
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,743
WELL, SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY CLOSE FRIENDS

104
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,245
THAT ARE JUST HERS

105
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,247
BUT,LAST WEEK, SHE MET THIS WOMAN

106
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,748
AT THE GYM-- SUSAN SOMETHING--

107
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,250
AND THEY REALLY HIT IT OFF

108
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,253
AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

109
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,258
SO, UH, ERIC...

110
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,760
WHAT KIND OF PHOTOGRAPHY DO YOU DO?

111
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,262
OH, MOSTLY FASHION.

112
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,265
SO THERE MAY BE MODELS HERE FROM TIME TO TIME.

113
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,266
I HOPE THAT'S COOL.

114
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,269
YES, IT IS COOL...

115
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:33,273
UH, BECAUSE I HAVE MODELS HERE, YOU KNOW...

116
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,275
NEVER.

117
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,276
WHAT ELSE? OOH, YEAH.

118
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,778
DURING THE SUMMER, I SPEND MOST WEEKENDS

119
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,280
AT MY SISTER'S BEACH HOUSE

120
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,781
WHICH YOU ARE WELCOME TO USE, BY THE WAY.

121
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,283
ALTHOUGH I SHOULD

122
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,784
PROBABLY TELL YOU

123
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,786
SHE'S A PORN STAR.

124
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,789
WELL, LISTEN, I, UH, STILL HAVE

125
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,291
ONE MORE PERSON TO, UH, MEET

126
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,793
BUT UNLESS IT TURNS OUT TO BE YOUR SISTER...

127
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,295

128
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,298
I THINK YOUR CHANCES ARE PRETTY GOOD.

129
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,300
ALL RIGHT.

130
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,305
BEDROOM, BATHROOM, LIVING ROOM

131
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,806

132
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,809

134
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,817
SURE. UH, HMM...

135
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,820
WHAT'S UP?

136
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,323
WELL, UH, I'M AN ACTOR.

137
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,324
I'M FAIRLY NEAT.

138
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,827
I, UH, I GOT MY OWN TV.

139
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,329
OH, AND DON'T WORRY.

140
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,332
I'M TOTALLY OKAY WITH THE GAY THING.

141
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,835
WHAT GAY THING?

142
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,338

TOTALLY COOL WITH THAT.

145
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,846

146
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,349
WELL, OKAY, JERRY.

147
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,351
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.

148
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,854
HI.

149
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,857
HEY.

150
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,370
HEY, MON.

151
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,872
YOU WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING THAT SUCKS?

152
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,374
DO I EVER.

153
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,377
CHRIS SAYS THEY'RE CLOSING DOWN THE BAR.

154
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,878
NO WAY.

155
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,879
YEAH, APPARENTLY, THEY'RE TURNING IT

156
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,880
INTO SOME KIND OF COFFEE PLACE.

157
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,882
JUST COFFEE?

158
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,384
WHERE ARE WE GOING TO HANG OUT NOW?

159
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,885
GOT ME.

160
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,387
CAN I GET A BEER, PLEASE?

161
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,388
DID YOU PICK A ROOMMATE?

162
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,389
YOU BETCHA.

163
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,890
IS IT THE ITALIAN GUY?

164
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,392
YEAH, RIGHT.

165
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,893
OHH... HE'S SO CUTE.

166
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,395
OH, YES, THAT'S WHAT I WANT--

167
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,897
A ROOMMATE THAT I CAN WALK AROUND WITH

168
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,899
AND BE REFERRED TO AS "THE FUNNY ONE."

169
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,401
OH, LOOK. POOL TABLE'S FREE.

170
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,403
RACK THEM UP. I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.

171
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,905
GET READY FOR ME TO WHIP YOUR BUTT.

172
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,409
OKAY, BUT AFTER THAT, WE'RE SHOOTING SOME POOL.

173
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,910
OH. NO, NO, NO.

174
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,412
EXCUSE ME.

175
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,414
HELLO. HI.

176
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,915
MY FRIEND

177
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,417
ORDERED AN ONION

178
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,419
NOT AN OLIVE.

179
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,922
AND, UH, I ORDERED A RUM AND DIET COKE

180
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,425
WHICH I DON'T THINK THIS IS.

181
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,426
I AM SO SORRY.

182
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,927
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

183
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,929
I MEAN, HOW HARD IS IT

184
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,432
TO GET A COUPLE DRINKS RIGHT, HUH?

185
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,435
WELL...

186
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,936
I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST.

187
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,438
OH!

188
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,940
TO THE WOMAN WHO, IN ONE YEAR FROM TODAY

189
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,445
WILL BECOME MRS. DR. BARRY FARBER, D.D.S.

190
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,948
MMM. I THINK IT'S TIME TO SEE THE RING AGAIN.

191
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,950

192
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,454
ISN'T IT EXCITING?

193
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,957
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE HAVING A BOYFRIEND FOR LIFE.

194
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,959

195
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,461
YEAH.

196
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,962
I KNOW.

197
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,964
WHAT?

198
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,467
OHH... I DON'T KNOW.

199
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,469
WELL, MAYBE IT'S JUST

200
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,472
THE IDEA OF BARRY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

201
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,973
I DON'T KNOW.

202
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,977
I THINK I I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO HAVE ONE LAST FLING, YOU KNOW?

203
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,979
JUST TO SORT OF GET IT OUT OF MY SYSTEM.

204
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,484
RACHEL, STOP.

205
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,985
YOU'RE SO BAD.

206
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,487
I'M SERIOUS.

207
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,989
I REALLY... I THINK I NEED TO JUST HAVE SOME...

208
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,991
MEANINGLESS... SEX, YOU KNOW?

209
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,993
WITH THE NEXT GUY I SEE.

210
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,001
EXCUSE ME.

211
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:26,005
I... SEEM TO HAVE DROPPED MY BALL.

212
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,007
YEAH, SO?

213
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,012
AND NOW I'VE PICKED IT UP AGAIN.

214
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,517
OH, MY GOD.

215
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,018
I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH HER.

216
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,020
RACHEL!

217
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,522
HI.

218
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,024
MONICA!

219
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,028
IS SHE GIVING ME THE FINGER?

220
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,530
MONICA!

221
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,531
LOOK. HI.

222
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,032
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

223
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,033
OH, MY GOD.

224
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,036
YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE WHERE THE TITANIC HIT IT.

225
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,037

226
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,539
YES. HIS NAME IS BARRY.

227
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,041
HE'S A DOCTOR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

228
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,043
AW, JUST LIKE YOU ALWAYS WANTED.

229
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,044
CONGRATULATIONS.

230
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,045
THANK YOU.

231
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,046
SO HOW ABOUT YOU?

232
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,048
ARE YOU SEEING ANYBODY?

233
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,049
OH, NOT RIGHT NOW.

234
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,052
OH, WELL, THAT'S OKAY.

235
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,554
I KNOW.

236
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,561
WELL, SO I THINK I'LL GET BACK TO MY FRIEND.

237
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,062
OH, YEAH, SURE, SURE.

238
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,063
SURE, SURE, SURE.

239
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,569
LISTEN. CAN WE PLEASE HAVE LUNCH

240
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,070
THE NEXT TIME I'M IN THE CITY?

241
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,572
OH, THAT'D BE GREAT.

242
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,573
OKAY. THANKS.

243
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,574
BYE. BYE.

244
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,078
TEN BUCKS SAYS I NEVER SEE THAT WOMAN AGAIN IN MY LIFE.

245
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,081
NO, REAL... HONEY, REALLY.

246
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,082
IT'S FINE.

247
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,083
JUST...

248
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,585
GO WITH SUSAN.

249
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,086
REALLY, I THINK...

250
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,590
NO, I THINK GIRLS' NIGHT OUT IS A GREAT IDEA.

251
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,093
OKAY. OKAY, BYE.

252
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,595
SO WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

253
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,596
I DON'T KNOW.

254
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,598
SOMETHING GIRLY.

255
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,100
HEY.

256
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,602
HEY, YOU'RE EARLY.

257
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,103
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THE LAMP?

258
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,607
I'M JUST TAKING IT TO GET REWIRED.

259
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,110
DON'T TAKE IT TO THE SAME PLACE YOU TOOK THE STEREO

260
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,612
BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD THAT THING

261
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,113
FOR OVER A WEEK.

262
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,116

263
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,121
NO.

264
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,623
NO, MR. HECKLES.

265
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,124
NO ONE IS MAKING ANY NOISE UP HERE!

266
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,127
YOU'RE DISTURBING MY OBOE PRACTICE.

267
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,128
YOU DON'T PLAY THE OBOE.

268
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,631
I COULD PLAY THE OBOE.

269
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,634
 THEN I'M GOING  TO HAVE TO ASK YOU TO KEEP IT DOWN.

270
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:40,640
WHO ARE YOU?

271
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,141
HI. I'M ERIC.

272
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,143
I'M GOING TO BE CHANDLER'S NEW ROOMMATE.

273
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,645
I'M CHANDLER'S NEW ROOMMATE.

274
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,648
I DON'T THINK SO.

275
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,650
I COULD BE CHANDLER'S NEW ROOMMATE.

276
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,652
BUT HE TOLD ME OVER THE PHONE...

277
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,153
HE TOLD ME IN PERSON.

278
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,656
OH. THAT'S WEIRD.

279
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:01,160
WELL, I'M GOING TO, UH, GO INTO MY NEW APARTMENT NOW.

280
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,164
HUH?

281
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,170

282
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,180
HI AGAIN.

283
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,182
HEY.

284
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,188
HEY.

285
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,189
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

286
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,191
OH, NO, NO, NO. DON'T THANK ME.

287
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,694
THANK THE JERK THAT DIDN'T SHOW UP.

288
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,195
OKAY, I GOT TO GET TO WORK.

289
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,697
AND NOT JUST FOR THE MONEY.

290
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,198
BUT ALSO BECAUSE, EVERY NOW AND THEN

291
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,700
SOMEBODY WALKS OUT OF THE BATHROOM

292
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,201
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF TOILET PAPER

293
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,703
ON THEIR SHOE.

294
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,208
YOU NEED SOME HELP WITH THAT?

295
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,710
OH, NO THANKS. I GOT IT.

296
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,211
OH, NO, I DON'T.

297
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,713
WHOA!

298
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,714
OKAY.

299
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,716
WHOO!

300
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,718
I STOOD UP TOO FAST.

301
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,720
GOT A LITTLE HEAD RUSH.

302
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,722
IT'S THE HEAT.

303
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,724

304
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,225
AND THE HUMIDITY.

305
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,227

306
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,730
THAT'S A, UH...

307
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,732
THAT'S A TOUGH COMBINATION.

308
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,233

309
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,739
DO YOU WANT TO COME IN FOR SOME LEMONADE?

310
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,741
LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

311
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,745
OHH...

312
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,748
WOW.

313
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,751
THIS IS A GREAT PLACE.

314
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,753
OH, THANK YOU.

315
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,255
JUST... MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.

316
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,758
GOTCHA.

317
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,760

318
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,261
SO THIS PLACE

319
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,263
IS REALLY MY GRANDMOTHER'S.

320
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,767
I GOT IT FROM HER WHEN SHE MOVED TO FLORIDA.

321
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,771
OTHERWISE I COULD NEVER AFFORD A PLACE LIKE THIS.

322
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,276
SO IF THE LANDLORD EVER ASKS

323
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:01,280
I'M AN 87 YEAR OLD WOMAN WHO'S AFRAID OF HER VCR.

324
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,281
YOU THIRSTY?

325
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,284
YOU BET I AM.

326
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,286
OKAY.

327
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,789
HERE'S YOUR... PENIS!

328
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,292
OH, MY GOD!

329
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,294
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!

330
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,797
YOU SAID, "YOU WANT TO COME IN FOR SOME LEMONADE?"

331
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,298
SO?!

332
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,301
WERE... AH! WERE YOU JUST GOING TO GIVE ME LEMONADE?

333
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,803
YEAH HUH!

334
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,805
WOULD YOU COVER YOURSELF UP?!

335
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,807
OH, RIGHT. SORRY.

336
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,808
GOD, I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

337
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,810
SOMEONE ASKS YOU IN FOR LEMONADE

338
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,312
AND TO YOU, THAT MEANS THEY WANT TO HAVE SEX?!

339
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,313
UM, USUALLY...

340
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,816
YEAH. WELL, NOT JUST LEMONADE.

341
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,818
ICED TEA... SOMETIMES JUICE.

342
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,321
LOOK, I'M... SORRY.

343
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,324
I JUST... THOUGHT YOU LIKED ME.

344
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,326
I'M SUCH A JERK.

345
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,329
IT'S OKAY.

346
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,330

347
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,833
I SUPPOSE IT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE.

348
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,835
NOT ANYONE I KNOW, BUT...

349
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,839
BY THE WAY, I CAN STILL SEE IT.

350
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,852
PHEEBS?

351
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,353
HUH?

352
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,354
WHERE'S YOUR BED?

353
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,860
IT'S NOT IN THE APARTMENT?

354
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,864
OH, NO.

355
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,868
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING AGAIN.

356
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,870
WHAT?

357
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,873
OKAY, ENOUGH OF THE THIRD DEGREE!

358
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,877
I I I DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

359
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,879
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

360
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,880
I'M SORRY.

361
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,882
I... I... I...

362
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,884
I DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

363
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,388
I I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU, BUT, YOU KNOW

364
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,391
EVERYBODY ELSE KNOWS.

365
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,393
EVERYBODY KNOWS?

366
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,896
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A GOOD THING.

367
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,898
I FORGET WHY.

368
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,399
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.

369
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,901
I THOUGHT WE WERE DOING SO MUCH BETTER LATELY.

370
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,903
YEAH, BECAUSE I MOVED OUT.

371
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,906
MONICA, I...

372
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,407
DO YOU KNOW...

373
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,910
OKAY, DO YOU KNOW I COULDN'T SLEEP FOR, LIKE, A MONTH

374
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,412
BECAUSE I GOT A DOT OF INK ON ONE OF THE SOFA CUSHIONS?

375
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,415
WELL, YOU COULD HAVE JUST TURNED THE CUSHION OVER.

376
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,917
I WOULD HAVE, EXCEPT I HAD

377
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,919
A BIG SPAGHETTI STAIN ON THE OTHER SIDE.

378
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,920
WHAT?!

379
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,422
THIS IS WHAT  I'M TALKING ABOUT.

380
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,926
I NEED TO LIVE IN A LAND WHERE PEOPLE CAN SPILL.

381
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,929
WELL, YOU CAN SPILL...

382
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,431
IN THE SINK.

383
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,434
AW, HONEY, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, YOU KNOW.

384
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,435
THIS IS WHO YOU ARE

385
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,937
AND I LOVE YOU

386
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,438
AND I WANT US TO BE FRIENDS

387
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,940
AND IF I KEEP LIVING HERE

388
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,942
I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING.

389
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,444
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

390
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,947
OH, GOOD.

391
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,949
HMM...

392
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,450
WHAT?

393
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,953
WHAT? I'M JUST SAD.

394
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:54,954
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

395
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,957
YOU'RE WONDERING WHICH CUSHION IT IS.

396
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,460
WELL, WHY CAN'T I THINK OF BOTH?

397
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,462
I MEAN, I CAN THINK TWO THINGS.

398
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,964
GO AHEAD. LOOK.

399
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,466
YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO. GO.

400
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,469
OH, MY GOD!

401
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,977
SO, UH...

402
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,978
WHAT YOU WATCHING?

403
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,479
BAYWATCH.

404
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,481
Move south towards the pier!

405
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,983
WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

406
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,985
UH... LIFEGUARDS.

407
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:26,986
WHAT?

408
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,489
WELL, IT SOUNDS KIND OF STUPID.

409
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,992
WHO'S SHE?

410
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,994
 NICOLE EGGERT.

411
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,996
WE LIKE HER.

412
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,503
WOW, LOOK AT THEM RUN.

413
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,006
YEAH...

414
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,507
THEY DO THAT A LOT.

415
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,511
HEY, YOU WANT A BEER?

416
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,512
YEAH. I'LL GO GET ONE.

417
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,513
NO, NO, DON'T GET UP.

418
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,515
I GOT A COOL ER RIGHT HERE.

419
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,018

420
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,520
 HELLO.

421
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,521
HEY.

422
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,023
DO YOU HAVE ANY BEERS?

423
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,524
WE'RE OUT OF BEERS.

424
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,026
HELP YOURSELF.

425
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,028
YOU OKAY?

426
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,032
PHOEBE MOVED OUT.

427
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,536
RIGHT.

428
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,538
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

429
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,041
AM I SO HARD TO LIVE WITH?

430
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,043
IS THIS WHY I DON'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

431
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,547
NO! YOU DON'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND BECAUSE...

432
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:32,551
I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DON'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

433
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,055
YOU SHOULD HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

434
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,558
WELL, I THINK SO.

435
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,560
OH, COME HERE.

436
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,062
COME HERE.

437
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,565
LISTEN.

438
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,068
YOU ARE ONE OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE

439
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,070
AND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

440
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,072
I'VE EVER KNOWN IN REAL LIFE.

441
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,073
OH...

442
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,088
HI.

443
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,591
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

444
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,093
OH, IT'S ALREADY CLOSED.

445
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,095
CHRIS GAVE ME THE KEYS TO LOCK UP.

446
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,096
WHAT IS WRONG?

447
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,097
MY MARRI...

448
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,099
I THINK MY MARRIAGE IS, UM...

449
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,600
IS KIND OF OVER.

450
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,103
OH, NO! WHY?

451
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,105
BECAUSE CAROL'S A LESBIAN.

452
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:33,112
AND... AND I'M NOT ONE...

453
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,118
AND, APPARENTLY, IT'S NOT A MIX AND MATCH SITUATION.

454
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,121
OH, MY GOD!

455
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,124
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

456
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,127
OH, YOU POOR BUNNY.

457
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,629
I'M AN IDIOT.

458
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,132
I MEAN, I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT.

459
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,134
I MEAN, CAROL AND I'D BE OUT

460
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,137
AND SHE'D SEE SOME BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, AND...

461
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,640
AND SHE'D BE, YOU KNOW, "ROSS, LOOK AT HER."

462
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,143
AND I'D THINK...

463
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,645
"GOD, MY WIFE IS COOL."

464
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,651
OH...

465
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:16,155
HEY, DO YOU THINK THAT SUSAN PERSON IS HER LOVER?

466
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,660
WELL, NOW I DO.

467
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,162
OH, GOD!

468
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,164
I'M SORRY.

469
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,166

470
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,168
SEVEN YEARS.

471
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,671
I MEAN... WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER SEVEN YEARS.

472
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,175
SHE'S THE ONLY WOMAN WHO'S EVER LOVED ME.

473
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,677
SHE'S THE ONLY WOMAN I I'VE EVER...

474
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,180
OH. OH, ROSS.

475
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,681
OH...

476
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,186
MMM... THIS IS NICE.

477
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,188
I KNOW. IT IS, ISN'T IT?

478
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,191
NO, I MEAN IT.

479
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,193
THIS FEELS REALLY GOOD.

480
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,697
IS IT 100% COTTON?

481
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,202
YEAH...

482
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,704
AND I GOT IT ON SALE, TOO.

483
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,707
I MEAN, IT LOOKS NUBBY

484
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,709
BUT... BUT IT'S NOT.

485
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,711
ANYWAY, I SHOULD GO.

486
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,713
ONE OF THE LIFEGUARDS

487
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,217
WAS JUST ABOUT TO DISMANTLE A NUCLEAR DEVICE.

488
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,220
IF YOU WANT TO GET A DRINK LATER, WE CAN.

489
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,222
YEAH. THAT SOUNDS GREAT. OKAY.

490
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,724
OH, AND LISTEN, IT'S... IT'S GOING TO BE...

491
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,226
I KNOW.

492
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,228
THANKS.

493
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,234
MAYBE THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED

494
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,736
IF I'D BEEN MORE NURTURING OR...

495
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:41,740
I'D PAID MORE ATTENTION OR I'D...

496
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,743
HAD A UTERUS.

497
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,745
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

498
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,747
NO, NO, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS.

499
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,250
YOU DON'T. ROSS. YOU'RE YOU'RE REALLY...

500
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,251
YOU'RE SO GOOD.

501
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,252
THANKS.

502
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,753
AND YOU'RE SO... SWEET AND...

503
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,754
THANKS.

504
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,256
YOU'RE KIND AND...

505
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,757
THANKS.

506
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,270
COME HERE.

507
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,773
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

508
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,275
HUH?

509
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,779
OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

510
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,781

511
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,782
OH!

512
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,286

513
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,787
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

514
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,789
MY FOOT IS STUCK IN THE POCKET.

515
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,790
WHAT?

516
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,792
I CAN'T GET IT OUT.

517
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,795
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING A GIRL WANTS TO HEAR.

518
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,297
DON'T START.

519
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,298
OKAY.

520
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,299
OW.

521
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,300
WHAT?

522
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,802
STUPID BALLS ARE IN THE WAY.

523
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,310

524
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,814

525
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,822
OH, WELL.

526
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,824
IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T

527
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,328
HAVE BEEN THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE SOLUTION.

528
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,830
YOU HAVE CHALK ON YOUR FACE.

529
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,333
OH, ROSS, YOU'RE RIGHT.

530
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,335
I DON'T KNOW WHY I ALWAYS THOUGHT

531
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,836
THIS WAS REAL GRASS.

532
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,845
HONEY, YOU OKAY?

533
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,848
MY WIFE'S A LESBIAN.

534
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,350
COOL.

535
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,354

536
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,355
ROSS, JOEY.

537
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,856
JOEY, ROSS.

538
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,368
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU CAME BACK.

539
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,869
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

540
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,871
I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK.

541
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,373
I DON'T WANT TO THINK.

542
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,375
I JUST WANT YOU TO TAKE ME

543
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,877
AND KISS ME AND MAKE LOVE TO ME

544
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,880
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

545
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,885

546
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,890
 RACHEL...? RACHEL!

547
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,392
WHAT?

548
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,894
YOU MISSED THE EXIT.

549
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,397
OH. SORRY.

550
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,900
MY GOD, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

551
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,402

552
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,904
UM... BARRY.

553
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,906
AW... AW...

554
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:35,414
?? IT'S THE TIME OF THE SEASON FOR LOVING... ??
