3523
02:23:21,931 --> 02:23:23,432
SO I TOLD CARL

3524
02:23:23,432 --> 02:23:24,433
NOBODY-- NO MATTER HOW FAMOUS

3525
02:23:24,934 --> 02:23:25,935
THEIR PARENTS ARE--

3526
02:23:25,935 --> 02:23:27,937
NOBODY'S ALLOWED TO CLIMB ON THE DINOSAUR.

3527
02:23:28,437 --> 02:23:29,939
BUT, OF COURSE...

3528
02:23:30,439 --> 02:23:33,442
 I LOVE HOW HE CARES SO MUCH ABOUT STUFF.

3529
02:23:33,442 --> 02:23:35,945
IF I SQUINT, I CAN PRETEND HE'S ALAN ALDA.

3530
02:23:38,948 --> 02:23:41,450
OH, GOOD. ANOTHER DINOSAUR STORY.

3531
02:23:43,452 --> 02:23:45,955
WHEN ARE THOSE GOING TO BECOME EXTINCT?

3532
02:23:48,958 --> 02:23:52,461
IF I WAS A SUPERHERO WHO COULD FLYANDBE INVISIBLE

3533
02:23:52,962 --> 02:23:54,964
THAT WOULD BE THE BEST.

3534
02:23:59,468 --> 02:24:02,471
WHAT DOES RACHEL SEE IN THIS GUY?

3535
02:24:04,473 --> 02:24:05,975
I LOVE RACHEL.

3536
02:24:08,477 --> 02:24:10,980
I WISH SHE WAS MY WIFE.

3537
02:24:12,982 --> 02:24:16,485

3538
02:24:22,992 --> 02:24:24,994
WHO'S SINGING?    3552 02:25:14,543 --> 02:25:16,045 HEY, WHEN YOU GUYS WERE KIDS

3553
02:25:16,545 --> 02:25:19,048
AND YOU PLAYED HAPPY DAYS, WHO WERE YOU?

3554
02:25:19,048 --> 02:25:20,049
I WAS ALWAYS RICHIE.

3555
02:25:20,549 --> 02:25:22,051
I WAS ALWAYS JOANIE.

3556
02:25:22,551 --> 02:25:23,552
QUESTION.

3557
02:25:23,552 --> 02:25:25,054
WAS "EGG THE GELLERS!"

3558
02:25:25,054 --> 02:25:27,556
THE WAR CRY OF YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD?

3559
02:25:27,556 --> 02:25:29,058
 EW! EW!

3560
02:25:29,058 --> 02:25:30,559
IT'S THE MATTRESS KING.

3561
02:25:30,559 --> 02:25:32,561
DON'T LOOK, HONEY. CHANGE THE CHANNEL.

3562
02:25:32,561 --> 02:25:34,563
WAIT. I WANT TO SEE THIS.

3563
02:25:34,563 --> 02:25:37,066
AFTER I DIVORCE HIM, HALF OF THAT KINGDOM

3564
02:25:37,066 --> 02:25:38,567
IS GOING TO BE MINE.

3565
02:25:38,567 --> 02:25:41,570
Despair fills the mattress showroom.

3566
02:25:41,570 --> 02:25:44,073
My kingdom is suddenly without a queen.

3567
02:25:44,073 --> 02:25:47,076
I'm so depressed, I'm going to slash...

3568
02:25:47,576 --> 02:25:48,577
my prices!

3569
02:25:48,577 --> 02:25:50,579
Check it out!

3570
02:25:50,579 --> 02:25:52,581
599 DOLLARS for a Comfort King!

3571
02:25:52,581 --> 02:25:54,583
499 DOLLARS for a pillow top queen set!

3572
02:25:55,084 --> 02:25:57,086
I'm going medieval on prices!

3573
02:25:57,586 --> 02:25:59,088
WHAT A WANK.

3574
02:25:59,088 --> 02:26:02,091
OH, I CANNOT BELIEVE HE'S USING OUR DIVORCE

3575
02:26:02,091 --> 02:26:03,592
TO SELL MATTRESSES.

3576
02:26:03,592 --> 02:26:06,095
I KNOW. AT $499 FOR A PILLOW TOP QUEEN SET

3577
02:26:06,095 --> 02:26:07,596
WHO CARES ABOUT THE DIVORCE?

3578
02:26:07,596 --> 02:26:09,598
THOSE BABIES WILL SELL THEMSELVES.

3579
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:15,104
AND I'M APPALLED FOR YOU, BY THE WAY.

3580
02:26:15,604 --> 02:26:17,106
You'll be glad you did.

3581
02:26:17,106 --> 02:26:18,607
I'm close. I'm cheap.

3582
02:26:18,607 --> 02:26:20,109
I'm the king.

3583
02:26:21,110 --> 02:26:26,115
HE STUFFS THAT COD PIECE, RIGHT?

3584
02:26:26,115 --> 02:26:28,117
OH, YEAH.

3585
02:26:36,625 --> 02:26:38,627
HERE YOU GO.

3586
02:26:38,627 --> 02:26:40,129
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

3587
02:26:40,629 --> 02:26:42,631
I ASKED FOR NO CINNAMON ON TOP.

3588
02:26:42,631 --> 02:26:44,133
OH.

3589
02:26:48,137 --> 02:26:50,139
YEAH. OKAY. ALL RIGHT, DADDY.

3590
02:26:50,139 --> 02:26:51,640
WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT.

3591
02:26:51,640 --> 02:26:53,142
OKAY. BYE.

3592
02:26:55,144 --> 02:26:56,645
"WE"?

3593
02:26:57,146 --> 02:27:00,149
...ARE, UH, HAVING DINNER WITH MY DAD TOMORROW NIGHT.

3594
02:27:00,149 --> 02:27:01,650
I HOPE THAT'S OKAY.

3595
02:27:01,650 --> 02:27:02,651
OH, SHOOT.

3596
02:27:02,651 --> 02:27:04,653
TOMORROW'S NOT SO GOOD.

3597
02:27:04,653 --> 02:27:07,156
I'M SUPPOSED TO FALL OFF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING

3598
02:27:07,156 --> 02:27:09,158
AND LAND ON A BICYCLE WITH NO SEAT, SO...

3599
02:27:11,660 --> 02:27:14,163
ROSS, MY FATHER DOESN'T HATE YOU.

3600
02:27:14,163 --> 02:27:15,164
PLEASE.

3601
02:27:15,664 --> 02:27:18,167
HE REFERS TO ME AS "WET HEAD."

3602
02:27:18,167 --> 02:27:20,669
BUT, HONEY, HE CALLS EVERYBODY BY A NICKNAME.

3603
02:27:21,170 --> 02:27:22,671
OKAY, LOOK, JUST ONE DINNER.

3604
02:27:22,671 --> 02:27:24,173
PLEASE, ONE NIGHT FOR ME?

3605
02:27:24,173 --> 02:27:27,176
PLEASE? I JUST WANT HIM TO LOVE YOU LIKE I DO.

3606
02:27:27,676 --> 02:27:29,678
ALL RIGHT. WELL, NOT EXACTLY LIKE I DO.

3607
02:27:30,179 --> 02:27:32,181
BUT, IF YOU DO COME TO DINNER

3608
02:27:32,181 --> 02:27:33,682
I'LL LOVE YOU LIKE I DO

3609
02:27:34,183 --> 02:27:36,185
IN THAT BLACK THING THAT YOU LIKE.

3610
02:27:36,185 --> 02:27:37,186

3611
02:27:37,186 --> 02:27:38,687
I'LL GO.

3612
02:27:42,191 --> 02:27:43,192
FINE.

3613
02:27:43,192 --> 02:27:44,693
THANK YOU.

3614
02:27:48,197 --> 02:27:50,199
HI, GUNTHER.

3615
02:27:50,199 --> 02:27:52,201
YEAH. WE'LL SEE.

3616
02:27:54,203 --> 02:27:55,204
HEY, YOU GUYS.

3617
02:27:55,204 --> 02:27:56,205
HEY.

3618
02:27:56,205 --> 02:27:57,706
GUESS WHAT.

3619
02:27:57,706 --> 02:27:59,708
I GOT A GIG.

3620
02:27:59,708 --> 02:28:01,710
THAT'S WHY I COULD NEVER BE AN ACTOR--

3621
02:28:01,710 --> 02:28:03,212
BECAUSE I CAN'T SAY "GIG."

3622
02:28:03,212 --> 02:28:04,713
I CAN'T SAY "CROISSANT."

3623
02:28:05,214 --> 02:28:06,715
OH, MY GOD!

3624
02:28:06,715 --> 02:28:07,716
WHAT'S THE PART?

3625
02:28:07,716 --> 02:28:09,718
IT'S NOT A PART.

3626
02:28:09,718 --> 02:28:12,221
NO. I'M TEACHING ACTING FOR SOAP OPERAS

3627
02:28:12,221 --> 02:28:13,722
DOWN AT THE LEARNING EXTENSION.

3628
02:28:14,223 --> 02:28:14,723
COME ON, THAT'S GREAT.

3629
02:28:15,224 --> 02:28:17,226
YEAH, YEAH, IT'S LIKE MY CHANCE

3630
02:28:17,226 --> 02:28:20,229
TO GIVE SOMETHING BACK TO THE ACTING COMMUNITY.

3631
02:28:20,229 --> 02:28:23,732
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT ALLOWED TO SLEEP

3632
02:28:23,732 --> 02:28:25,734
WITH ANY OF YOUR STUDENTS.

3633
02:28:28,237 --> 02:28:29,738
I KNOW.

3634
02:28:35,744 --> 02:28:36,745
I DON'T KNOW, MONICA.

3635
02:28:36,745 --> 02:28:38,247
IT FEELS FUNNY JUST BEING HERE.

3636
02:28:38,247 --> 02:28:41,250
I MEAN, IF YOU BUY A BED FROM JANICE'S EX HUSBAND

3637
02:28:41,250 --> 02:28:43,252
THAT'S LIKE BETRAYING CHANDLER.

3638
02:28:43,252 --> 02:28:45,254
NOT AT THESE PRICES.

3639
02:28:49,758 --> 02:28:51,760
HI.

3640
02:28:51,760 --> 02:28:53,262
YOU KNOW, IN ENGLAND

3641
02:28:53,262 --> 02:28:55,764
THIS CAR WOULD BE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORE.

3642
02:29:00,269 --> 02:29:01,770
WHOOSH!

3643
02:29:02,771 --> 02:29:05,774
OHH... OHH...

3644
02:29:06,275 --> 02:29:08,277
PHOEBE, COME HERE.

3645
02:29:08,277 --> 02:29:10,779
OHH. THIS IS MY NEW BED.

3646
02:29:10,779 --> 02:29:13,282
YOU GOT TO FEEL THIS BAD BOY.

3647
02:29:13,782 --> 02:29:16,785
MONICA, IT STILL FEELS SO WEIRD, YOU KNOW.

3648
02:29:16,785 --> 02:29:18,287
CHANDLER'S YOUR FRIEND.

3649
02:29:18,287 --> 02:29:19,788

3650
02:29:19,788 --> 02:29:21,290
OH, MY GOD!

3651
02:29:21,290 --> 02:29:22,291
OHH.

3652
02:29:22,291 --> 02:29:24,293
ALL RIGHT, TAKE THIS BED.

3653
02:29:24,293 --> 02:29:26,295
YOU CAN MAKE OTHER FRIENDS.

3654
02:29:34,803 --> 02:29:36,305
GOOD EVENING.

3655
02:29:36,305 --> 02:29:39,308
I AM MR. TRIBBIANI...

3656
02:29:39,308 --> 02:29:42,811
AND I'LL BE TEACHING ACTING FOR SOAP OPERAS.

3657
02:29:42,811 --> 02:29:45,814
UNFORTUNATELY, TONIGHT WILL BE MY ONLY CLASS

3658
02:29:45,814 --> 02:29:48,317
BECAUSE, DUE TO A RARE BLOOD DISEASE

3659
02:29:48,317 --> 02:29:50,819
I ONLY HAVE TWO WEEKS TO LIVE.

3660
02:29:50,819 --> 02:29:53,322
SO DO WE GET OUR DEPOSIT BACK?

3661
02:29:53,322 --> 02:29:55,324
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN EXAMPLE

3662
02:29:55,324 --> 02:29:56,825
OF ACTING FOR SOAP OPERAS.

3663
02:29:56,825 --> 02:29:59,828
THEN WHY ARE YOU ONLY TEACHING TONIGHT?

3664
02:29:59,828 --> 02:30:01,830
I'M NOT.

3665
02:30:01,830 --> 02:30:03,832
LOOK, WHY DON'T WE GET STRAIGHT TO THE LESSON.

3666
02:30:04,333 --> 02:30:05,334
OKAY? ALL RIGHT.

3667
02:30:05,334 --> 02:30:06,835
NOW, UM...

3668
02:30:06,835 --> 02:30:09,838
ON MY FIRST DAY AS DR. DRAKE RAMORAY

3669
02:30:09,838 --> 02:30:12,341
ON DAYS OF OUR LIVES...

3670
02:30:14,343 --> 02:30:18,347
UH, I LEARNED THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS

3671
02:30:18,347 --> 02:30:21,350
IN SOAP OPERA ACTING ISREACTING.

3672
02:30:21,850 --> 02:30:24,353
THIS DOES NOT MEAN ACTING AGAIN.

3673
02:30:24,353 --> 02:30:26,355
IT MEANS YOU DON'T

3674
02:30:26,355 --> 02:30:28,357
HAVE A LINE, BUT SOMEONE ELSE JUST DID

3675
02:30:28,857 --> 02:30:30,359
AND IT GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

3676
02:30:30,859 --> 02:30:32,861

3677
02:30:32,861 --> 02:30:34,363

3678
02:30:37,866 --> 02:30:38,867
THANKS. THANKS.

3679
02:30:38,867 --> 02:30:39,868
THANKS A LOT.

3680
02:30:39,868 --> 02:30:41,370
OH, BY THE WAY, BEFORE I FORGET

3681
02:30:41,870 --> 02:30:42,871
TO WORK IN SOAP OPERAS

3682
02:30:43,372 --> 02:30:45,374
SOME OF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BECOME MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE.

3683
02:30:45,874 --> 02:30:47,376
ALL RIGHT.

3684
02:30:47,376 --> 02:30:48,877
MOVING RIGHT ALONG...

3685
02:30:51,880 --> 02:30:53,382
HI.

3686
02:30:53,882 --> 02:30:54,883
HEY.

3687
02:30:54,883 --> 02:30:56,385
OOH! HOW WAS TEACHING LAST NIGHT?

3688
02:30:56,885 --> 02:30:58,887
OH, IT WAS GREAT! YEAH, YOU GET TO SAY STUFF LIKE

3689
02:30:58,887 --> 02:31:00,889
"HEY, THE BELL DOESN'T DISMISS YOU.

3690
02:31:01,390 --> 02:31:03,392
I DIS MISS YOU."

3691
02:31:03,392 --> 02:31:04,893
OHH. NICE.

3692
02:31:05,394 --> 02:31:06,895
YEAH. OH, AND GUESS WHAT.

3693
02:31:06,895 --> 02:31:08,897
I GOT AN AUDITION FOR ALL MY CHILDREN.

3694
02:31:08,897 --> 02:31:09,898
OH, YAY!

3695
02:31:09,898 --> 02:31:11,400
YEAH, IT'S THIS GREAT PART.

3696
02:31:11,400 --> 02:31:14,403
THIS BOXER NAMED NICK, AND I'M SO, SO RIGHT FOR IT, YOU KNOW?

3697
02:31:14,403 --> 02:31:16,905
HE'S JUST LIKE ME, EXCEPT THAT HE'S A BOXER

3698
02:31:17,406 --> 02:31:19,408
AND HAS AN EVIL TWIN.

3699
02:31:19,408 --> 02:31:20,909

3700
02:31:20,909 --> 02:31:21,910
OH!

3701
02:31:23,912 --> 02:31:25,914
 DUM TA DA DUM.

3702
02:31:25,914 --> 02:31:27,416
HEAR YE, HEAR YE.

3703
02:31:27,416 --> 02:31:29,918
DELIVERY FROM THE MATTRESS KING.

3704
02:31:32,421 --> 02:31:33,422
YOU MISS GELLER?

3705
02:31:33,422 --> 02:31:34,923
OKAY.

3706
02:31:34,923 --> 02:31:35,924
SIGN HERE.

3707
02:31:37,426 --> 02:31:40,429
OOH. DO I HAVE A MIDDLE NAME?

3708
02:31:40,429 --> 02:31:42,431
ALL RIGHT. MONICA FALOOLA...

3709
02:31:42,931 --> 02:31:44,433
GELLER.

3710
02:31:44,433 --> 02:31:46,435
IT'S THAT BEDROOM THERE.

3711
02:31:49,938 --> 02:31:52,441
HEY, MONICA BOUGHT A BED FROM THE MATTRESS KING?

3712
02:31:52,441 --> 02:31:53,442
YEAH. SO, PLEASE, PLEASE

3713
02:31:53,442 --> 02:31:55,444
PLEASE DON'T SAY ANYTHING TO CHANDLER.

3714
02:31:55,944 --> 02:31:57,446
YOU WANT ME TO LIE TO CHANDLER?

3715
02:31:57,446 --> 02:31:58,447
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

3716
02:31:58,947 --> 02:32:00,449
NO.

3717
02:32:00,449 --> 02:32:02,451
OH, HEY, HEY, NICK THE BOXER

3718
02:32:02,451 --> 02:32:03,952
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

3719
02:32:03,952 --> 02:32:05,454
PUT THEM UP. COME ON.

3720
02:32:05,954 --> 02:32:06,955
HEY...

3721
02:32:06,955 --> 02:32:08,457
YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD AT THIS.

3722
02:32:08,457 --> 02:32:09,458
YEAH, WELL, I HAD TO LEARN.

3723
02:32:09,958 --> 02:32:10,959
I WAS STAYING AT THE "Y"

3724
02:32:10,959 --> 02:32:12,961
AND SOME OF THE YOUNG MEN WEREN'T

3725
02:32:12,961 --> 02:32:14,463
ACTING CHRISTIAN ENOUGH.

3726
02:32:16,965 --> 02:32:18,467
HEY, NOW. HEY!

3727
02:32:18,467 --> 02:32:19,968
OW!

3728
02:32:19,968 --> 02:32:20,969
AND I'M BLEEDING.

3729
02:32:21,470 --> 02:32:22,471
OKAY, GREAT.

3730
02:32:22,971 --> 02:32:25,474
WOW! AND I'M A VEGETARIAN.

3731
02:32:25,474 --> 02:32:26,475
ALL RIGHT.

3732
02:32:26,475 --> 02:32:27,476
WELL, I'M SORRY.

3733
02:32:27,476 --> 02:32:28,977
WE'LL PUT SOME ICE ON IT.

3734
02:32:28,977 --> 02:32:30,479
PUT YOUR HEAD BACK.

3735
02:32:30,479 --> 02:32:31,480
ALL RIGHT.

3736
02:32:31,480 --> 02:32:32,481
I CAN'T SEE.

3737
02:32:32,981 --> 02:32:33,482
I HAVE YOU.

3738
02:32:33,982 --> 02:32:34,983
OH, GOD.

3739
02:32:35,484 --> 02:32:38,487
WHICH BEDROOM DO YOU WANT IT IN, MISS GELLER?

3740
02:32:38,487 --> 02:32:39,988
IT'S THE COMPULSIVELY NEAT ONE

3741
02:32:39,988 --> 02:32:41,490
BY THE WINDOW, OKAY?

3742
02:32:41,490 --> 02:32:42,491
GOTCHA.

3743
02:32:49,998 --> 02:32:51,500
HI, DADDY.

3744
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:53,502
THIS IS WHERE THEY PUT US?

3745
02:32:53,502 --> 02:32:56,505
WHAT? THERE WAS NO TABLE AVAILABLE IN THE KITCHEN?

3746
02:32:56,505 --> 02:32:57,506
OH. HI, DADDY.

3747
02:32:58,006 --> 02:32:58,507
HELLO, BABY.

3748
02:32:59,007 --> 02:33:00,008
YOU REMEMBER ROSS.

3749
02:33:00,509 --> 02:33:01,510
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, DR. GREEN.

3750
02:33:02,010 --> 02:33:03,512
SO!

3751
02:33:09,518 --> 02:33:10,519
HOW'S THE LIBRARY?

3752
02:33:10,519 --> 02:33:12,020
UH, MUSEUM.

3753
02:33:12,020 --> 02:33:14,022
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LIBRARY?

3754
02:33:14,022 --> 02:33:16,024
THERE NEVER WAS A LIBRARY.

3755
02:33:16,024 --> 02:33:17,526
I MEAN, THERE ARE LIBRARIES.

3756
02:33:17,526 --> 02:33:20,529
IT'S JUST THAT I, UM.. . I'VE NEVER WORKED AT ONE.

3757
02:33:24,533 --> 02:33:27,035
YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY GOOD HERE? THE LOBSTER.

3758
02:33:27,035 --> 02:33:28,537
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

3759
02:33:28,537 --> 02:33:30,038
SHALL I JUST ORDER THREE?

3760
02:33:30,038 --> 02:33:31,039
YEAH, IF YOU'RE REALLY HUNGRY.

3761
02:33:36,545 --> 02:33:39,047
IT WAS A JO... I MADE A JOKE.

3762
02:33:39,047 --> 02:33:40,549
YEAH. ACTUALLY, DADDY

3763
02:33:40,549 --> 02:33:42,551
ROSS IS ALLERGIC TO LOBSTER.

3764
02:33:42,551 --> 02:33:45,053
WHAT KIND OF PERSON IS ALLERGIC TO LOBSTER?

3765
02:33:45,053 --> 02:33:47,556
I GUESS THE KIND OF PERSON THAT WORKS IN A LIBRARY.

3766
02:33:47,556 --> 02:33:48,557
IT'S NOT A LI...

3767
02:33:48,557 --> 02:33:50,559
I KNOW. IT'S A MUSEUM. WHAT, YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

3768
02:33:50,559 --> 02:33:52,561
AROUND HERE WHO CAN MAKE A JOKE? AT LEAST MINE WAS FUNNY.

3769
02:33:52,561 --> 02:33:54,062
UHH... WAITER.

3770
02:33:54,563 --> 02:33:58,066
WE WILL HAVE TWO LOBSTERS AND A MENU.

3771
02:34:01,570 --> 02:34:04,573
SO, DR. GREEN, HOW'S THE OLD BOAT?

3772
02:34:04,573 --> 02:34:06,074
THEY FOUND RUST.

3773
02:34:06,575 --> 02:34:08,076
YOU KNOW WHAT RUST DOES TO A BOAT?

3774
02:34:08,577 --> 02:34:11,079
GIVES IT A NICE, ANTIQUE Y LOOK?

3775
02:34:15,584 --> 02:34:18,086
RUST IS BOAT CANCER, ROSS.

3776
02:34:18,086 --> 02:34:21,089
WOW. I'M SORRY.

3777
02:34:21,089 --> 02:34:23,592
WHEN I WAS A KID, I LOST A BIKE TO THAT.

3778
02:34:29,097 --> 02:34:31,099
EXCUSE ME FOR A MOMENT, WILL YOU, PLEASE?

3779
02:34:31,099 --> 02:34:34,102
I WANT TO SAY GOOD NIGHT TO THE LEVINES BEFORE WE GO.

3780
02:34:34,102 --> 02:34:35,103
OKAY.

3781
02:34:38,607 --> 02:34:39,608
HONEY, STOP.

3782
02:34:39,608 --> 02:34:41,109
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

3783
02:34:41,109 --> 02:34:42,611
YEAH.

3784
02:34:42,611 --> 02:34:44,112
UH OH.

3785
02:34:44,112 --> 02:34:45,614
I THINK YOUR DAD MUST HAVE ADDED WRONG.

3786
02:34:46,114 --> 02:34:47,616
HE ONLY TIPPED, LIKE, FOUR PERCENT.

3787
02:34:47,616 --> 02:34:49,618
YEAH. THAT'S DADDY.

3788
02:34:49,618 --> 02:34:50,619
THAT'S DADDY?

3789
02:34:51,119 --> 02:34:52,621
DOESN'T IT BOTHER YOU?

3790
02:34:52,621 --> 02:34:54,122
YOU'RE A WAITRESS.

3791
02:34:54,623 --> 02:34:55,624
YES, IT BOTHERS ME, ROSS

3792
02:34:55,624 --> 02:34:57,626
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF HE WAS A REGULAR

3793
02:34:57,626 --> 02:35:00,629
AT THE COFFEE HOUSE, I'D BE SERVING HIM "SNEEZERS."

3794
02:35:00,629 --> 02:35:01,630
SO?

3795
02:35:01,630 --> 02:35:03,131
SO, ROSS

3796
02:35:03,131 --> 02:35:05,133
I'VE BUGGED HIM ABOUT THIS A MILLION TIMES.

3797
02:35:05,133 --> 02:35:06,134
HE'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE.

3798
02:35:06,134 --> 02:35:09,137
DO YOU REALLY SERVE PEOPLE "SNEEZERS"?

3799
02:35:11,139 --> 02:35:12,641
WELL, UM, I DON'T.

3800
02:35:12,641 --> 02:35:14,142
ALL RIGHT, KIDS

3801
02:35:14,643 --> 02:35:15,644
READY?

3802
02:35:15,644 --> 02:35:17,646
THANKS AGAIN, DR. GREEN.

3803
02:35:23,652 --> 02:35:24,653
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

3804
02:35:25,153 --> 02:35:26,154
I THINK I FORGOT MY RECEIPT...

3805
02:35:26,154 --> 02:35:27,656
YOU DON'T NEED THAT.

3806
02:35:27,656 --> 02:35:28,657
WHY NOT?

3807
02:35:28,657 --> 02:35:30,158
THE CARBON-- IT'S MESSY.

3808
02:35:30,158 --> 02:35:31,660
I MEAN, GETS ON YOUR FINGERS

3809
02:35:32,160 --> 02:35:34,162
AND CAUSES THE, THE... NIGHT BLINDNESS.

3810
02:35:37,666 --> 02:35:39,167
WHAT IS THIS?

3811
02:35:39,668 --> 02:35:41,169
WHO PUT A 20 DOWN HERE?

3812
02:35:41,169 --> 02:35:42,671
HUH?

3813
02:35:42,671 --> 02:35:44,673
OH, YEAH, THAT WOULD BE ME.

3814
02:35:44,673 --> 02:35:46,174
UM, I HAVE... I HAVE A PROBLEM.

3815
02:35:46,675 --> 02:35:48,176
I I TIP WAY TOO MUCH. WAY, WAY TOO MU...

3816
02:35:48,176 --> 02:35:49,177
IT'S A SICKNESS, REALLY.

3817
02:35:49,177 --> 02:35:50,679
YEAH. IT IS.

3818
02:35:50,679 --> 02:35:52,180
WE REALLY, REALLY HAVE TO DO SOMETHI...

3819
02:35:52,681 --> 02:35:53,682
I KNOW. EXCUSE ME.

3820
02:35:53,682 --> 02:35:55,183
YOU THINK I'M CHEAP?

3821
02:35:55,183 --> 02:35:57,185
OH, DADDY, HE DIDN'T MEAN...

3822
02:35:57,185 --> 02:35:58,186
HUH?

3823
02:35:58,186 --> 02:35:59,187
HE REALLY DIDN'T.

3824
02:35:59,688 --> 02:36:02,691
NOTHING I DO MEANS ANYTHING, REALLY.

3825
02:36:04,192 --> 02:36:05,193
THIS IS NICE.

3826
02:36:05,193 --> 02:36:07,696
I PAY 200 DOLLARS FOR DINNER, YOU PUT DOWN 20

3827
02:36:07,696 --> 02:36:10,198
AND YOU COME OUT LOOKING LIKE MR. BIG SHOT.

3828
02:36:10,699 --> 02:36:13,201
YOU REALLY WANT TO BE MR. BIG SHOT? HERE.

3829
02:36:13,201 --> 02:36:14,202
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

3830
02:36:14,202 --> 02:36:16,705
YOU PAY THE WHOLE BILL, MR. BIG SHOT, ALL RIGHT?

3831
02:36:19,207 --> 02:36:22,711
WELL, "MR. BIG SHOT" IS BETTER THAN "WET HEAD."

3832
02:36:24,713 --> 02:36:26,715
OKAY. SOME TRICKS OF THE TRADE.

3833
02:36:26,715 --> 02:36:30,218
NOW, I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CRY AS AN ACTOR.

3834
02:36:30,218 --> 02:36:33,221
SO, IF I'M IN A SCENE WHERE I HAVE TO CRY

3835
02:36:33,221 --> 02:36:37,225
I CUT A HOLE IN MY POCKET, TAKE A PAIR OF TWEEZERS...

3836
02:36:37,225 --> 02:36:39,227
AND JUST START PULLING.

3837
02:36:41,229 --> 02:36:42,230
OKAY?

3838
02:36:42,230 --> 02:36:45,233
OR, UH, LET'S SAY I WANT TO CONVEY

3839
02:36:45,233 --> 02:36:47,235
THAT I'VE JUST DONE SOMETHING EVIL.

3840
02:36:47,235 --> 02:36:49,237
WELL, THAT WOULD BE YOUR BASIC

3841
02:36:49,237 --> 02:36:51,239
"I'VE GOT A FISHHOOK IN MY EYEBROW"

3842
02:36:51,239 --> 02:36:52,240
AND I, LIKE...

3843
02:36:55,744 --> 02:36:57,746
HMM? OKAY.

3844
02:36:57,746 --> 02:36:59,748
LET'S SAY I'VE JUST GOTTEN BAD NEWS.

3845
02:37:00,248 --> 02:37:01,249
WELL, ALL I DO THERE

3846
02:37:01,750 --> 02:37:04,753
IS TRY AND DIVIDE 232 BY 13.

3847
02:37:13,762 --> 02:37:15,764
AND THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE.

3848
02:37:15,764 --> 02:37:18,266
GREAT SOAP OPERA ACTING TONIGHT, EVERYBODY.

3849
02:37:18,266 --> 02:37:19,267
CLASS DISMISSED.

3850
02:37:22,270 --> 02:37:24,272
HEY, MR. TRIB, GUESS WHAT.

3851
02:37:24,272 --> 02:37:26,274
I GOT AN AUDITION!

3852
02:37:26,274 --> 02:37:28,777
OH. ONE OF MY STUDENTS GOT AN AUDITION.

3853
02:37:28,777 --> 02:37:29,778
I'M SO PROUD.

3854
02:37:29,778 --> 02:37:32,280
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER

3855
02:37:32,280 --> 02:37:33,782
COACHING ME FOR IT?

3856
02:37:33,782 --> 02:37:34,783
YOU BET.

3857
02:37:34,783 --> 02:37:35,784
WHAT'S THE PART?

3858
02:37:35,784 --> 02:37:36,785
OH, IT'S GREAT.

3859
02:37:36,785 --> 02:37:38,286
IT'S A ROLE IN ALL MY CHILDREN.

3860
02:37:38,787 --> 02:37:39,788
NICK THE BOXER.

3861
02:37:47,295 --> 02:37:48,797
YOU HAD TO DO  IT, DIDN'T YOU?

3862
02:37:48,797 --> 02:37:50,298
YOU COULDN'T JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.

3863
02:37:50,298 --> 02:37:51,299
FOUR PERCENT, OKAY?

3864
02:37:51,800 --> 02:37:52,801
I TIP MORE THAN THAT

3865
02:37:52,801 --> 02:37:54,803
WHEN THERE'S A BUG IN MY FOOD.

3866
02:37:55,303 --> 02:37:57,806
ROSS, TONIGHT WAS ABOUT THE TWO OF YOU GETTING ALONG.

3867
02:37:58,306 --> 02:37:59,307

3868
02:37:59,307 --> 02:38:00,809
WOULD YOU JUST SEE MY CHIROPRACTOR ALREADY?

3869
02:38:01,309 --> 02:38:02,811
YEAH, I'M GOING TO GO TO A DOCTOR

3870
02:38:02,811 --> 02:38:03,812
WHO WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL

3871
02:38:04,312 --> 02:38:05,814
IN A MINI MALL.

3872
02:38:08,817 --> 02:38:09,818
HEY, PHEEBS.

3873
02:38:09,818 --> 02:38:11,319
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

3874
02:38:11,820 --> 02:38:14,823
I... I'M FREAKING OUT!

3875
02:38:14,823 --> 02:38:17,826
MONICA KIND OF TRUSTED ME WITH SOMETHING

3876
02:38:17,826 --> 02:38:19,327
AND SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE.

3877
02:38:19,327 --> 02:38:23,331
I HAVEN'T LIVED HERE IN A WHILE, SO I HAVE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

3878
02:38:23,331 --> 02:38:26,334
DOES MONICA STILL TURN THE LIGHTS ON IN HER BEDROOM?

3879
02:38:26,334 --> 02:38:28,837
YEAH.

3880
02:38:28,837 --> 02:38:30,338
I AM SO DEAD.

3881
02:38:32,841 --> 02:38:35,343
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE, ROSS.

3882
02:38:35,343 --> 02:38:37,345
THIS IS FIXABLE IF WE ACT FAST, OKAY?

3883
02:38:37,846 --> 02:38:39,347
I'LL INVITE HIM TO BRUNCH TOMORROW

3884
02:38:39,347 --> 02:38:40,348
AND YOU CAN MAKE NICE.

3885
02:38:40,849 --> 02:38:42,350
HONEY, I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE NICE.

3886
02:38:42,350 --> 02:38:43,852
IT DOESN'T WORK.

3887
02:38:43,852 --> 02:38:46,354
LOOK, ROSS, I REALIZE THAT MY FATHER IS DIFFICULT

3888
02:38:46,354 --> 02:38:48,356
BUT THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE GOT

3889
02:38:48,356 --> 02:38:49,858
TO BE THE BIGGER MAN HERE.

3890
02:38:50,358 --> 02:38:52,360
LOOK, SWEETIE, I COULD BE THE BIGGER MAN.

3891
02:38:52,360 --> 02:38:53,862
I COULD BE THE BIGGEST MAN.

3892
02:38:53,862 --> 02:38:55,864
I COULD BE A BIG, HUGE, GIANT MAN

3893
02:38:55,864 --> 02:38:57,866
AND IT STILL WOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE

3894
02:38:57,866 --> 02:39:00,368
EXCEPT THAT I COULD PICK YOUR FATHER UP

3895
02:39:00,368 --> 02:39:02,370
AND SAY, "LIKE ME. LIKE ME, TINY DOCTOR."

3896
02:39:02,370 --> 02:39:04,873
OKAY, WELL, CAN'T YOU JUST TRY IT

3897
02:39:04,873 --> 02:39:06,875
ONE MORE TIME, ROSS? FOR ME. FOR ME.

3898
02:39:07,375 --> 02:39:10,378
RACHEL, ONE BRUNCH IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE ANYTHING.

3899
02:39:10,378 --> 02:39:11,379
YOU'VE GOT TO FACE IT, OKAY?

3900
02:39:11,880 --> 02:39:12,881
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GET ALONG.

3901
02:39:12,881 --> 02:39:15,383
OKAY, WELL, YOU ARE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO, OKAY?

3902
02:39:15,383 --> 02:39:17,385
BECAUSE I'VE ALREADY GOT A MOTHER AND A FATHER

3903
02:39:17,385 --> 02:39:19,387
WHO CANNOT STAY IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER, OKAY?

3904
02:39:19,387 --> 02:39:21,389
I DON'T WANT A SEPARATE ROOM FOR YOU, TOO!

3905
02:39:21,389 --> 02:39:23,391
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

3906
02:39:23,391 --> 02:39:25,894
I'LL GET THE BAGELS.

3907
02:39:30,899 --> 02:39:31,900
WHAT'S THIS?

3908
02:39:33,401 --> 02:39:36,404
ISN'T IT COOL? VROOM! VROOM!

3909
02:39:37,906 --> 02:39:39,407
THIS IS NOT THE BED I ORDERED.

3910
02:39:39,407 --> 02:39:40,909
WON I KNOW. YOU MUST HAVE

3911
02:39:40,909 --> 02:39:42,410
LIKE, A CONTEST OR SOMETHING.

3912
02:39:42,410 --> 02:39:43,912

3913
02:39:43,912 --> 02:39:44,913
PHOEBE.

3914
02:39:44,913 --> 02:39:46,414

3915
02:39:46,414 --> 02:39:48,917
WHY IS THIS CAR IN MY BEDROOM?

3916
02:39:48,917 --> 02:39:50,418
I'M SORRY, OKAY? I WASN'T LOOKING

3917
02:39:50,418 --> 02:39:52,921
AND THE STORE SAID THAT THEY WON'T TAKE IT BACK

3918
02:39:52,921 --> 02:39:54,422
BECAUSE YOU SIGNED FOR IT.

3919
02:39:54,422 --> 02:39:55,423
WHEN DID I SIGN FOR IT?

3920
02:39:55,924 --> 02:39:56,925
WHEN I WAS YOU.

3921
02:39:56,925 --> 02:39:58,426
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S ALL JOEY'S FAULT

3922
02:39:58,426 --> 02:39:59,928
BECAUSE HE LEFT HIS NOSE OPEN.

3923
02:40:02,430 --> 02:40:03,932
DID YOU MAKE BROWNIES TODAY?

3924
02:40:04,432 --> 02:40:05,934
 KNOCK, KNOCK.

3925
02:40:05,934 --> 02:40:07,435
QUICK, TAKE OFF YOUR DRESS.

3926
02:40:07,435 --> 02:40:08,937
HE WON'T NOTICE THE BED.

3927
02:40:11,940 --> 02:40:12,941
HEY, I'M GOING FOR SUSHI.

3928
02:40:12,941 --> 02:40:14,442
DOES ANYBODY WANT, UH...

3929
02:40:14,442 --> 02:40:16,444

3930
02:40:16,444 --> 02:40:18,947
WHOA, SOMEBODY MISSED THE OFF RAMP.

3931
02:40:21,449 --> 02:40:22,951
IT'S MONICA'S BED.

3932
02:40:22,951 --> 02:40:23,952
WHAT?

3933
02:40:23,952 --> 02:40:25,954
OKAY.

3934
02:40:26,454 --> 02:40:28,957
IT'S A RACE CAR.

3935
02:40:28,957 --> 02:40:30,959
SO, THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN MONICA'S BED.

3936
02:40:31,459 --> 02:40:32,460
YOU'RE JUST NOTICING NOW?

3937
02:40:32,961 --> 02:40:34,462
HOW SELF INVOLVED ARE YOU?

3938
02:40:36,464 --> 02:40:38,466
OKAY, WELL, IF THIS BED ISN'T NEW

3939
02:40:38,466 --> 02:40:40,969
THEN HOW COME THERE'S PLASTIC ON THE MATTRESS?

3940
02:40:41,970 --> 02:40:44,973
SOMETIMES I HAVE BAD DREAMS.

3941
02:40:48,977 --> 02:40:49,978
LOOK...

3942
02:40:49,978 --> 02:40:51,479
I JUST SAW MY BEST FRIEND'S BRAINS

3943
02:40:51,980 --> 02:40:54,482
SMEARED ACROSS THE CANVAS.

3944
02:40:54,482 --> 02:40:56,985
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ME.

3945
02:40:56,985 --> 02:40:58,987
NOT ME.

3946
02:40:58,987 --> 02:41:01,990
WOW.

3947
02:41:01,990 --> 02:41:04,993
THAT... THAT... THAT WAS GOOD. THAT WAS...

3948
02:41:05,493 --> 02:41:06,494
TWEEZERS?

3949
02:41:06,995 --> 02:41:07,996
NO.

3950
02:41:07,996 --> 02:41:08,997
OH, WOW.

3951
02:41:09,497 --> 02:41:11,499
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.

3952
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,002
THANKS.

3953
02:41:14,002 --> 02:41:15,003
ANY SUGGESTIONS?

3954
02:41:15,003 --> 02:41:17,005
HMM. I...

3955
02:41:22,010 --> 02:41:25,013
YOU TOLD HIM TO PLAY THE BOXER GAY?!

3956
02:41:28,516 --> 02:41:33,521
WELL, I I MIGHT HAVE SAID "SUPER GAY."

3957
02:41:33,521 --> 02:41:35,023
JOEY, THE LAST TIME

3958
02:41:35,023 --> 02:41:37,525
AN ACTOR DID SOMETHING THIS BAD

3959
02:41:37,525 --> 02:41:39,027
A PRESIDENT DIED.

3960
02:41:39,027 --> 02:41:41,029
LINCOLN. BOOTH.

3961
02:41:41,029 --> 02:41:42,530
SOMETHING HAPPEN ED AT THE TUNNEL?

3962
02:41:44,532 --> 02:41:46,534
JOEY, YOU'RE THIS GUY'S TEACHER.

3963
02:41:46,534 --> 02:41:48,036
I MEAN, HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?

3964
02:41:48,536 --> 02:41:50,038
BECAUSE, MONICA, THE GUY'S SO GOOD

3965
02:41:50,538 --> 02:41:52,540
AND I REALLY, REALLY WANT THIS PART.

3966
02:41:52,540 --> 02:41:55,543
WELL, IF YOU REALLY, REALLY WANT IT, THEN IT'S OKAY.

3967
02:41:57,545 --> 02:41:58,546
HI, DADDY.

3968
02:41:58,546 --> 02:42:00,048
BABY.

3969
02:42:01,049 --> 02:42:02,550
ROSS.

3970
02:42:02,550 --> 02:42:04,052
DR. GREEN, HOW ARE YOU?

3971
02:42:06,054 --> 02:42:08,556
THANKS FOR DINNER LAST NIGHT.

3972
02:42:08,556 --> 02:42:12,560
THANK YOU FOR TEACHING ME A VALUABLE LESSON.

3973
02:42:12,560 --> 02:42:13,561
NICE HAIR.

3974
02:42:13,561 --> 02:42:15,063
WHAT DID YOU DO, SWIM HERE?

3975
02:42:18,566 --> 02:42:20,068
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

3976
02:42:20,068 --> 02:42:21,569
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

3977
02:42:21,569 --> 02:42:23,071
WHAT? HE'S INTERESTED IN YOU.

3978
02:42:23,071 --> 02:42:24,072
HE LIKES YOUR HAIR

3979
02:42:24,572 --> 02:42:26,574
AND HE JUST WANTS TO KNOW HOW YOU GOT HERE.

3980
02:42:26,574 --> 02:42:28,576
OH, PLEASE. SWEETIE, IT'S HOPELESS, OKAY?

3981
02:42:28,576 --> 02:42:30,578
I'M JUST GOING TO GO. WHAT? ROSS...

3982
02:42:30,578 --> 02:42:32,580
LOOK, I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST...

3983
02:42:32,580 --> 02:42:34,582
ROSS, WHAT'S WITH THE NECK?

3984
02:42:34,582 --> 02:42:35,583
HE'S GOT THIS THING.

3985
02:42:35,583 --> 02:42:37,585
I KEEP TELLING HIM TO GO TO MY CHIROPRACTOR.

3986
02:42:37,585 --> 02:42:39,587
YOU'RE STILL GOING TO THAT CHIROPRACTOR?

3987
02:42:39,587 --> 02:42:42,090
THAT MAN COULDN'T GET INTO MED SCHOOL IN IXTAPA.

3988
02:42:42,090 --> 02:42:43,591
YEAH, THANK YOU.

3989
02:42:43,591 --> 02:42:45,593
THAT'S WHAT I KEEP SAYING.

3990
02:42:45,593 --> 02:42:48,596
EXCUSE ME. DR. BOBBY HAPPENS TO BE AN EXCELLENT DOCTOR.

3991
02:42:49,097 --> 02:42:50,098
WAIT A MINUTE.

3992
02:42:50,098 --> 02:42:52,600
HIS NAME IS DR. BOBBY?

3993
02:42:53,101 --> 02:42:55,103
WELL, THAT'S HIS LAST NAME.

3994
02:42:55,103 --> 02:42:56,104
AND HIS FIRST NAME.

3995
02:42:56,604 --> 02:42:58,106
HE'S BOBBY BOBBY?

3996
02:42:59,607 --> 02:43:00,608

3997
02:43:00,608 --> 02:43:02,110
IT'S ROBERT BOBBY.

3998
02:43:02,110 --> 02:43:03,111
OH HO.

3999
02:43:03,611 --> 02:43:05,613
AND, UM... EXCUSE ME. HE HELPS ME.

4000
02:43:05,613 --> 02:43:08,116
OH, PLEASE. ASK HER HOW.

4001
02:43:08,116 --> 02:43:09,617
WHAT DO YOU NEED HELP FOR?

4002
02:43:09,617 --> 02:43:12,120
WITH MY ALIGNMENT. I'VE GOT ONE LEG SHORTER THAN THE OTHER.

4003
02:43:12,120 --> 02:43:13,121
OH, MY GOD.

4004
02:43:13,121 --> 02:43:14,622
ARGUE WITH THAT.

4005
02:43:14,622 --> 02:43:16,624
WHAT? IT'S TRUE. MY RIGHT LEG IS TWO INCHES SHORTER.

4006
02:43:16,624 --> 02:43:18,126
COME ON. YOU'RE JUST TILTING.

4007
02:43:20,128 --> 02:43:21,129
HER LEGS ARE FINE.

4008
02:43:21,129 --> 02:43:22,630
I KNOW THAT.

4009
02:43:22,630 --> 02:43:24,132
SO WHAT DO YOU LET HER GO TO A CHIROPRACTOR FOR?

4010
02:43:24,132 --> 02:43:25,633
I'M SORRY. "LET HER"?

4011
02:43:25,633 --> 02:43:27,635
WHAT CAN I DO? SHE DOESN'T LISTEN TO ME

4012
02:43:27,635 --> 02:43:29,137
ABOUT RENTER'S INSURANCE EITHER.

4013
02:43:29,137 --> 02:43:30,638
WAIT A MINUTE.

4014
02:43:31,139 --> 02:43:33,141
YOU DON'T HAVE RENTER'S INSURANCE?

4015
02:43:33,141 --> 02:43:34,642
NO.

4016
02:43:34,642 --> 02:43:37,645
WELL, WHAT IF SOMEBODY STEALS SOMETHING?

4017
02:43:37,645 --> 02:43:40,648
HOW YOU GOING TO RUN AFTER THEM WITH

4018
02:43:40,648 --> 02:43:42,150
ONE LEG SHORTER THAN THE OTHER?

4019
02:43:42,150 --> 02:43:43,651

4020
02:43:46,154 --> 02:43:48,656
HEY, WOULD YOU, UH, WOULD YOU LIKE SOME JUICE?

4021
02:43:48,656 --> 02:43:50,158
I'D LOVE SOME JUICE. THANK YOU.

4022
02:43:50,658 --> 02:43:51,659
OKAY.

4023
02:43:51,659 --> 02:43:54,162
WOW. THIS IS GOING SO WELL.

4024
02:43:54,162 --> 02:43:55,663
DID YOU SEE US ? DID YOU SEE?

4025
02:43:55,663 --> 02:43:58,166
YEAH, HONEY, I WAS STANDING RIGHT THERE.

4026
02:43:58,166 --> 02:44:00,668
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL HIM ABOUT THE MOLE

4027
02:44:00,668 --> 02:44:02,170
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN CHECKED YET?

4028
02:44:02,170 --> 02:44:03,671
EXCELLENT.

4029
02:44:06,174 --> 02:44:09,177
THERE WILL COME A TIME IN EACH OF YOUR CAREERS

4030
02:44:09,177 --> 02:44:11,179
WHEN YOU'LL HAVE A CHANCE

4031
02:44:11,179 --> 02:44:14,182
TO SCREW OVER ANOTHER SOAP OPERA ACTOR.

4032
02:44:14,182 --> 02:44:17,185
I HAD SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE RECENT PRESENT...

4033
02:44:19,687 --> 02:44:23,191
AND I'M ASHAMED TO SAY THAT I TOOK IT.

4034
02:44:25,693 --> 02:44:29,197
I ADVISED A FELLOW ACTOR TO PLAY A ROLE...

4035
02:44:30,698 --> 02:44:32,200
HOMOSEXUALLY.

4036
02:44:35,203 --> 02:44:36,704
YEAH.

4037
02:44:37,705 --> 02:44:41,209
WE BOTH AUDITIONED FOR THE PART

4038
02:44:41,209 --> 02:44:43,711
AND, UH... AS IT TURNED OUT...

4039
02:44:44,712 --> 02:44:46,714
THEY, UH...

4040
02:44:46,714 --> 02:44:51,219
THEY LIKED THE STUPID GAY THING AND CAST HIM.

4041
02:44:52,720 --> 02:44:53,721
AND NOW...

4042
02:44:54,222 --> 02:44:57,725
HE'S GOT A TWO YEAR CONTRACT OPPOSITE...

4043
02:44:59,227 --> 02:45:04,232
SUSAN LUCCI, THE FIRST LADY OF DAYTIME TELEVISION.

4044
02:45:05,733 --> 02:45:07,735
AND ME...

4045
02:45:08,236 --> 02:45:11,739
ME, I'M STUCK HERE TEACHING A BUNCH OF PEOPLE

4046
02:45:11,739 --> 02:45:14,742
MOST OF WHOM ARE TOO UGLY TO EVEN BE ON TV.

4047
02:45:17,745 --> 02:45:20,248
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

4048
02:45:29,757 --> 02:45:31,759
THANK YOU.

4049
02:45:34,262 --> 02:45:35,263
 MAY I HELP YOU?

4050
02:45:35,763 --> 02:45:37,265
WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE.

4051
02:45:37,265 --> 02:45:39,767
I'M THE LADY WHO GOT STUCK WITH THE RACE CAR BED.

4052
02:45:40,268 --> 02:45:42,770
LOOK, IT'S LIKE I TOLD YOU.

4053
02:45:42,770 --> 02:45:45,273
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

4054
02:45:45,273 --> 02:45:46,774
YOU SIGNED FOR IT.

4055
02:45:46,774 --> 02:45:48,776
"MONICA FALOOLA GELLER."

4056
02:45:49,277 --> 02:45:51,779
ALL RIGHT, JESTER MAN, WE WANT TO SEE THE KING.

4057
02:45:51,779 --> 02:45:53,781
NOBODY SEES THE KING.

4058
02:45:54,282 --> 02:45:56,784
OKAY, I'M TALKING TO THE KING.

4059
02:45:56,784 --> 02:45:59,287
HEY, YOU CAN'T GO BACK THERE.

4060
02:46:04,292 --> 02:46:08,796
OHH... MY... GOD.

4061
02:46:17,805 --> 02:46:21,309

4062
02:46:21,309 --> 02:46:24,312
HEY! WATCH IT, LADY!

4063
02:46:24,312 --> 02:46:27,315

4064
02:46:27,315 --> 02:46:28,816

4065
02:46:30,318 --> 02:46:32,320
HEY, HEY, GOOD LOOKIN'.

4066
02:46:34,322 --> 02:46:36,324

4067
02:46:37,325 --> 02:46:40,328
