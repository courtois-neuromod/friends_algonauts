1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,506
Welcome, everybody.

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,508
Welcome to Amazing Discoveries!

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,010
OH!

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,511
OH, IT'S ON AGAIN!

5
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,013
YOU GUYS, CAN WE PLEASE NOT WATCH THIS?

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,514
SHH! SHH! SHH!

7
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,016
Folks, this ever happen to you?

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,518
You go in the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk

9
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,519
but these darn cartons

10
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,521
are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open?

11
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,523
You said it, Mike.

12
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,026
Oh! Oh! There's got to be

13
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,527
a better way.

14
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,029
And there is, Kevin.

15
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,531
CAN WE PLEASE TURN THIS OFF?

16
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,033
NO WAY, KEVIN.

17
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,534
What if I told you

18
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:38,038
that there's a revolutionary new product that guarantees

19
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,041
you'll never have to open up milk cartons again?

20
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,542
Meet the Milkmaster 2000!

21
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,044

22
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,545
ARE YOU INTRIGUED?

23
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,547
YOU'RE FLINGIN'-FLANGIN' RIGHT I AM.

24
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,049
This is his first time.

25
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,051
He's never used this product before.

26
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,054
You're going to see how easy this is to do.

27
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,056
Go ahead. This works in any milk carton.

28
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,557
Wow, it is easy.

29
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,560
Now I can have milk every day.

30
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,062

31
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,065
I CAN'T WATCH THIS ANYMORE, YOU GUYS.

32
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,566
ALL RIGHT, YOU'VE SUFFERED ENOUGH.

33
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,068
WE'LL CHANGE IT.

34
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,569
 How many times has this happened to you?

35
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,073
Argh! There's got to be a better way.     49 00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,624 WELL, IT'S OFFICIAL--

50
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,126
THERE ARE NO GOOD MOVIES.

51
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,129
SO LET'S GO TO A BAD ONE AND MAKE OUT.     53 00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,136 PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO TURN LIKE THIS

54
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,139
SO YOU CAN BUNNY BUMP AGAINST MY BACK.

55
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,640
HEY.

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,142
HEY, MAN. WHAT'S UP?

57
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,144
MAYBE YOU CAN TELL ME.

58
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,146
MY AGENT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY I DIDN'T SHOW UP

59
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,647
AT THE AUDITION I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD TODAY--

60
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,649
THE FIRST GOOD THING SHE GETS ME IN WEEKS.

61
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,151
HOW COULD YOU NOT GIVE ME THE MESSAGE?

62
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,654
WELL, I TELL YOU, I DO ENJOY GUILT...

63
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,656
BUT, UH, IT WASN'T ME.

64
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,158
YES, IT WAS.

65
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,659
IT WAS HIM. UH HUH.

66
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,162
OKAY, IT WAS ME.

67
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,165
HOW WAS IT YOU?

68
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,167
WELL, IT WAS ALL SO CRAZY, YOU KNOW.

69
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,669
I MEAN, CHANDLER WAS IN THE CLOSET COUNTING TO TEN

70
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,173
AND HE WAS UP TO SEVEN AND I HADN'T FOUND A PLACE

71
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,174
TO HIDE YET.

72
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,176
I... I MEANT TO TELL YOU

73
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,178
AND I WROTE IT ALL DOWN ON MY HAND.

74
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,679
SEE? ALL OF IT.

75
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,181
YEP, THAT'S MY AUDITION.

76
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,184
SEE? NOW THIS IS WHY I KEEP NOTEPADS EVERYWHERE.

77
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,686
YEP, AND THAT'S WHY

78
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,188
WE DON'T INVITE YOU TO PLAY.

79
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,190
WHAT IS THE GREAT TRAGEDY HERE?

80
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,192
YOU GO GET YOURSELF ANOTHER APPOINTMENT.

81
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,693
WELL, ESTELLE TRIED, YOU KNOW.

82
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,196
THE CASTING DIRECTOR TOLD HER I MISSED MY CHANCE.

83
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,697
WELL, THAT IS UNFAIR.

84
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,199
I'LL CALL HER.

85
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,201
I'LL TELL HER IT WAS TOTALLY MY FAULT.

86
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,702
PHEEBS, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

87
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,703
THE CASTING DIRECTOR DOESN'T TALK TO FRIENDS.

88
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,205
SHE ONLY TALKS TO AGENTS.

89
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,207
WHAT A SAD LITTLE LIFE SHE MUST LEAD.

90
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,210
OKAY. OOH.

91
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,711
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

92
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,213
NO, NO, NO, I KNOW, I KNOW.

93
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,714
OOH.

94
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,217
HI, THIS IS CAITLIN

95
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,219
FROM PHOEBE BUFFAY'S OFFICE.

96
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,222
UM... IS ANNE THERE FOR PHOEBE?

97
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,724
SHE'LL KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

98
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,226
HANG UP. HANG UP RIGHT...

99
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,727
ANNIE?

100
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,229
HI. LISTEN

101
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,231
WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM WITH JOEY TRIBBIANI.

102
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,233
APPARENTLY HE MISSED HIS AUDITION.

103
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,235
WHO DID YOU SPEAK TO IN MY OFFICE?

104
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,236
ESTELLE?

105
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,238
NO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO WITH HER.

106
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,240
ALL RIGHT, SO YOUR HUSBAND LEAVES YOU

107
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,741
AND THEN BURNS DOWN THE APARTMENT.

108
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,742
THE WORLD DOES NOT STOP.

109
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,245
IS ANYBODY ELSE SCARED?

110
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,747
RIGHT, WELL, LOOK, IF JOEY LOSES THIS AUDITION

111
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,749
THEN THAT IS IT FOR ESTELLE.

112
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,750
I DON'T CARE.

113
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,752
ANNIE, YOU ARE A DOLL.

114
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,254
WHAT TIME CAN YOU SEE HIM?

115
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,755
I NEED A PEN.

116
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,764
GET THE WOMAN A PAD! GET THE WOMAN A PAD!

117
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,766
A PAD! A PAD!

118
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,768
OH, NOW YOU WANT A PAD.

119
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,776
HUH.

120
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,278
WELL, THAT'S FUNNY.

121
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,779
UGLY, NAKED GUY IS STILL NAKED

122
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,281
BUT HIS DOG'S WEARING A SWEATER.

123
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,783

124
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,286
HEY!

125
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,289
HERE'S MY BOY.

126
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,291
HERE'S MY BOY.

127
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,793
AND HERE'S HIS... BARBIE.

128
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,299
WHAT'S, UH...?

129
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,302
WHAT'S MY BOY DOING WITH A BARBIE?

130
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,304
HE PICKED IT OUT OF THE TOY STORE HIMSELF.

131
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,805
HE LOVES IT.

132
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,307
HE CARRIES IT EVERYWHERE.

133
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,808
IT'S LIKE A SECURITY BLANKET--

134
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,810
BUT WITH SKI BOOTS AND A KICKY BERET.

135
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,314
YEAH, IT'S-- IT'S CUTE.

136
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,317
WHY-- WHY DOES HE HAVE IT AGAIN?

137
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,820
SO HE'S GOT A DOLL. SO WHAT?

138
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,823
UNLESS YOU'RE AFRAID

139
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,826
HE'S GOING TO GROW UP TO BE... IN SHOW BUSINESS.

140
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,328
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING

141
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,331
TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT HE'S BEING RAISED

142
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,832
BY TWO WOMEN, WOULD IT?

143
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,834
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S FINE.

144
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,836
IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH THE BARBIE THING

145
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,338
SO AM I.

146
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,839
GIVE DADDY THE BARBIE.

147
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,841
DON'T YOU WANT TO PLAY

148
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,344
WITH A MONSTER TRUCK?

149
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,845

150
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,347
NO?

151
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,848
OKAY, OOH, OOH, HOW ABOUT

152
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,850
A DINO SOLDIER.

153
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,354

154
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,857
ROSS, YOU ARE SO PATHETIC.

155
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,860
WHY CAN'T YOUR SON JUST PLAY WITH HIS DOLL?

156
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,869
I GOT TO GO TO WORK.

157
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,872
HAS ANYBODY SEEN MY LEFT BOOB?

158
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,376
I LOVED THAT MOVIE.

159
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,381
THERE IT IS.

160
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,382
JOEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

161
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,883
I'M SORRY.

162
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,385
IT JUST FELT NICE.

163
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,388

164
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,390
JOE, JOE, ANSWER THE PHONE.

165
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,891
HEY, I ONLY GOT ONE GOOD ARM.

166
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,394
YOU SHOULD BE DOING STUFF FOR ME.

167
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:35,895
GO GET ME A SWEATER.

168
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,397
JUST DO IT, OKAY? IT'S JANICE

169
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,899
AND IF I GET IT, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SEE HER TONIGHT.

170
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,401

171
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,902
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

172
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,904
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SEE HER TONIGHT.

173
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,905
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

174
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,407
WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE JANICE?

175
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,409
OKAY, LAST NIGHT AT DINNER WHEN THE MEALS CAME

176
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,911
SHE PUT HALF HER CHICKEN PICCATA ON MY PLATE

177
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,914
AND THEN SHE TOOK ALL MY TOMATOES.

178
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,918
AND THAT'S BAD BECAUSE...

179
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,421
YOU HATE CHICKEN PICCATA?

180
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,922
NO.

181
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,425
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE YOUR TOMATOES.

182
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,427
TOMATOES ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU.

183
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,929
NO. IT'S LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE WERE THIS COUPLE, OKAY?

184
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,432
AND THIS ALARM STARTED GOING OFF IN MY HEAD--

185
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,934
"RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! GET OUT OF THE BUILDING!"

186
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,438
OH, MEN ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

187
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,441
JANICE JUST THOUGHT SHE WAS GIVING YOU CHICKEN.

188
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,444
SHE DIDN'T THINK SHE WAS GIVING YOU SCARY CHICKEN.

189
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,945
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU PEOPLE?

190
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,448
I MEAN, THE MINUTE YOU START TO FEEL SOMETHING

191
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,449
YOU HAVE TO RUN AWAY?

192
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,950
I KNOW, THAT...

193
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,953
THAT'S WHY I DON'T WANT TO GO TONIGHT.

194
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,456
I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO SAY SOMETHING STUPID.

195
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,458
OH, YOU MEAN LIKE THAT GUY THING

196
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,460
WHERE YOU ACT ALL MEAN AND DISTANT

197
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,962
UNTIL YOU GET US TO BREAK UP WITH YOU.

198
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,464
HEY, YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

199
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,466
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, WHAT DO I DO?

200
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,967
I WANT TO GET PAST THIS.

201
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,970
I DON'T WANT TO BE AFRAID OF THE COMMITMENT THING.

202
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,972
I WANT TO GO THROUGH THE TUNNEL

203
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,973
TO THE OTHER SIDE.

204
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,976
WHERE THERE'S NO FEAR OF COMMITMENT.

205
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,979
SO DO WE HAVE ANY...?

206
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,486
DO WE HAVE ANY THOUGHTS HERE?

207
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,988
WELL, I'VE NEVER BEEN THROUGH THE TUNNEL MYSELF

208
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,990
BECAUSE, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED

209
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,992
TO GO THROUGH WITH MORE THAN ONE GIRL

210
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,994
IN THE CAR, RIGHT?

211
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,996
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME

212
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,499
IT'S PRETTY MUCH LIKE ANYTHING ELSE, YOU KNOW?

213
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,500
FACE YOUR FEAR.

214
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,001
YOU HAVE A FEAR OF HEIGHTS

215
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,003
YOU GO TO THE TOP OF THE BUILDING.

216
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,505
YOU'RE AFRAID OF BUGS...

217
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,006
GET A BUG.

218
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,007
RIGHT?

219
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,509
IN THIS CASE

220
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,511
YOU HAVE A FEAR OF COMMITMENT.

221
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,013
SO I SAY YOU GO IN THERE AND YOU BE

222
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,015
THE MOST COMMITTED GUY THERE EVER WAS.

223
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,518
AMAZINGLY, THAT MAKES SENSE.

224
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,019
DO YOU THINK?

225
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,521
OH, YEAH. GO FOR IT, MAN.

226
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,523
JUMP OFF THE HIGH DIVE.

227
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,525
STARE DOWN THE BARREL OF THE GUN.

228
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,027
PEE INTO THE WIND.

229
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,030
JOE, I ASSURE YOU, IF I'M STARING DOWN

230
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,033
THE BARREL OF A GUN, I'M GOING TO BE PRETTY MUCH

231
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,035
PEEING EVERY WHICH WAY.

232
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,040
YOU GUYS, LISTEN TO THIS

233
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,542
AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK, OKAY?

234
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,545
OKAY.

235
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,047
THAT'S INTERESTING.

236
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,549
HONEY...

237
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,551
OH, BECAUSE IT'S THE BEEPER.

238
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,554
OH, IT'S YOUR AUDITION FROM THIS MORNING!

239
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,056
CAN I USE THE PHONE AGAIN?

240
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,559
SURE, PHEEBS. YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT IT'S THERE FOR--

241
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,061
EMERGENCIES AND PRETEND AGENTS.

242
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,565
COME ON, BABY, COME ON.

243
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,568
HI. I HAVE PHOEBE BUFFAY

244
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,569
RETURNING A PAGE.

245
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,571
WELL, SHE'S IN HER CAR.

246
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,573
I'LL HAVE TO PATCH YOU THROUGH.

247
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,074
VERY NICE TOUCH.

248
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,577
OKAY, GO AHEAD.

249
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,579

250
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,581
TALK TO HER.

251
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,582
HI, ANNIE?

252
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,583
FANTASTIC.

253
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,084
YOU GOT IT!

254
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,088
OH, OKAY.

255
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,090
WILL HE WORK FOR SCALE, YOU ASK ME?

256
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,592
WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

257
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,093

258
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,595
EXCEPT THAT I DO, AND HE WILL.

259
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,597
GREAT. YOU ARE SUCH A SWEETHEART.

260
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,099
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE LUNCH WITH YOU.

261
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,102
HOW ABOUT WE HAVE LUNCH NEXT...

262
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,605
OOP. WENT THROUGH A TUNNEL.

263
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,106
UNBELIEVABLE.

264
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,609
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

265
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,110
HEY, IT WAS REALLY FUN.

266
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,613
I'VE NEVER TALKED ON A CAR PHONE BEFORE.

267
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,114
YOU WERE SO AMAZING.

268
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,116
COULD YOU DO ME THIS HUGE FAVOR?

269
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,619
SEE, THERE'S THIS ONE OTHER AUDITION THAT I REALLY, REALLY WANT

270
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,120
AND ESTELLE COULDN'T GET ME IN.

271
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,623
OH, I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, IT WAS FUN ONE TIME, BUT...

272
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,124
COME ON, PLEASE?

273
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,626
IT WOULD JUST BE THIS ONE MORE.

274
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,127
WELL, ACTUALLY IT'S TWO.

275
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,128
TWO?

276
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,130
YEAH... WELL, REALLY IT'S THREE.

277
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,632
PLEASE? YOU'RE SO GOOD AT IT.

278
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,634
I LOVE YOU.

279
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,635
OKAY, I'LL DO IT.

280
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,637
BUT JUST THESE THREE, RIGHT?

281
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,138
NO, IT'S FOUR.

282
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,145
SO HOW COME YOU WANTED TO EAT IN TONIGHT?

283
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,648
BECAUSE I WANTED TO, UH...

284
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,650
GIVE-- GIVE YOU THIS.

285
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,654
OH, ARE YOU A PUPPY.

286
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,660
CONTACT PAPER.

287
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,662
YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW

288
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,164
WHAT TO SAY WHEN SOMEONE YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH

289
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,166
GIVES YOU CONTACT PAPER.

290
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,668
WELL, WAIT, THERE'S MORE.

291
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,670
SEE, THE CONTACT PAPER IS TO GO IN...

292
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,174
YOUR BRAND NEW DRAWER.

293
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,679
SEE, THE DRAWER ACTUALLY GOES IN MY DRESSER.

294
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,182
OH, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

295
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,684
YES, I DID.

296
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,685
YES, I DID.

297
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,687
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY GIRLFRIEND.

298
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,189
AND THAT'S WHAT GIRLFRIENDS SHOULD GET.

299
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,194
OH, WELL, I GOT TO BUY A VOWEL...

300
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,699
BECAUSE "O" MY GOD!

301
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,201
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT

302
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:46,205
THAT SOMEDAY CHANDLER BING WOULD BUY ME A DRAWER?

303
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,208
WELL, NOT ME.

304
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,711
BUT THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED.

305
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,213
AND... AND THERE'S MORE.

306
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,717
WE SHOULD TAKE A TRIP.

307
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,718
WE SHOULD?

308
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,221
YEP. WE'RE A COUPLE, AND THAT'S WHAT COUPLES DO.

309
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,224
AND I WANT TO MEET YOUR PARENTS.

310
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,727
WE SHOULD TAKE A TRIP WITH YOUR PARENTS.

311
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,730

312
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,733
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO

313
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,736
BECAUSE YOU'RE TRIPPING ME OUT RIGHT NOW.

314
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,237
ARE YOU OKAY?

315
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,739
I AM.

316
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,240
I ACTUALLY AM.

317
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,742
I MEAN, THIS IS AMAZING.

318
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,244
MY ENTIRE LIFE, I HAVE FEARED THIS PLACE.

319
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,245
AND NOW THAT I'M HERE

320
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,748
IT'S LIKE, WHAT WAS THE BIG DEAL?

321
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,751
I MEAN, I COULD PROBABLY SAY, "LET'S MOVE IN TOGETHER"

322
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,752
AND I'D BE OKAY.

323
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,755
YOU PROBABLY WANT US TO MOVE IN TOGETHER?

324
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,757
IT DOESN'T SCARE ME.

325
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,759
YEAH, WELL, IT SCARES ME.

326
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,261
I MEAN, I'M NOT EVEN DIVORCED YET, CHANDLER.

327
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,263
YOU KNOW, YOU JUST INVITED ME OVER HERE FOR PASTA

328
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,266
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MOVING IN TOGETHER.

329
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,768
I WASN'T EVEN THAT HUNGRY.

330
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,770
YOU KNOW WHAT?

331
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,773
IT'S GETTING REALLY LATE, AND I SHOULD JUST, UM...

332
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,274
OH, NO. DON'T GO.

333
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,275
I'VE SCARED YOU.

334
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,777
I'VE SAID TOO MUCH.

335
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,278
I'M HOPELESS AND AWKWARD

336
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,781
AND DESPERATE FOR LOVE.

337
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,288
HEY, JANICE, IT'S ME.

338
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,291
UM... YEAH, I JUST WANTED TO APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE

339
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,293
FOR HAVING CHASED YOU DOWN THE STREET.

340
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,295
BYE BYE.

341
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,804
HERE YOU GO, HONEY.

342
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,805
THIS WILL HELP.

343
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,807
SO I FINALLY CATCH UP TO HER

344
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,309
AND SHE SAYS THIS RELATIONSHIP'S GOING TOO FAST

345
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,811
AND WE HAVE TO SLOW DOWN.

346
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,313
EWW, THAT IS NEVER GOOD.

347
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:39,318
THEN I GOT ALL... NEEDY AND CLINGY.

348
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,822
YOU DIDN'T BEG , DID YOU?

349
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,323
I SAID "PLEASE."

350
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,324
WELL, WAS IT "PLEASE"

351
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,826
WITH ONE "E" IN THE MIDDLE OF IT

352
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,327
OR LOTS OF "E's"?

353
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,329
OH, DEAR LORD, I BEGGED.

354
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,831
OKAY, NOW WAIT A MINUTE.

355
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,332
MAYBE IT'S NOT SO BAD.

356
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,834
HOW DID YOU LEAVE IT?

357
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,835
SHE SAID SHE'D CALL ME.

358
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,837
OH! OH!

359
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,339
OH, GOD.

360
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,341
WELCOME TO OUR SIDE

361
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,343
OF THE TUNNEL.

362
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,346
THIS ICE CREAM TASTES LIKE CRAP, BY THE WAY.

363
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,850
YEAH. WELL, THAT'S THAT LOW CAL, NON DAIRY SOY MILK JUNK.

364
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,853
WE SAVE THE REAL STUFF FOR THE TRULY TERMINAL CASES.

365
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,856
WHEN YOU START GETTING SCREWED OVER ALL THE TIME

366
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,357
YOU GOTTA SWITCH TO LOW FAT.

367
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,359
YEAH, YOU DO.

368
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,862
SO, YOU... YOU DON'T THINK I'M TERMINAL?

369
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:23,863
NO. NOT AT ALL.

370
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,364
YOU'RE NOT TERMINAL.

371
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,366
YOU JUST NEED SOME DAMAGE CONTROL.

372
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,368
OKAY. OKAY. SO, SHOULD I CALL HER?

373
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,870
NO! NO!

374
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,873
IT'S A VERY CRITICAL TIME RIGHT NOW.

375
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,375
IF YOU FEEL YOURSELF REACHING FOR THAT PHONE

376
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,877
YOU GO SHOE SHOPPING.

377
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,378
YOU GET YOUR BUTT IN A BUBBLE BATH.

378
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,379
IF YOU WANT HER BACK

379
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,381
YOU HAVE GOT TO START ACTING ALOOF.

380
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,383
ALOOF?

381
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,889
SHE NEEDS TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT NEEDY.

382
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,891
RIGHT. SO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS

383
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,394
YOU HAVE TO ACCIDENTALLY RUN INTO HER ON PURPOSE

384
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,896
AND THEN ACT ALOOF.

385
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,898
AND THEN I'LL BE OKAY?

386
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,399
YEAH. I THINK SO.

387
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,903
SO I'M NOT GOING TO LOSE HER?

388
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,406
OH, HONEY, YOU'RE NOT A TOTAL LOSER.

389
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,912
I SAID, "SO I'M NOT GOING TO LOSE HER?"

390
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,414
OH.

391
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,921
GUESS WHO'S HERE.

392
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,924
IT'S THE TOUGHEST GUY IN TOYLAND, BEN.

393
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,426
?? REAL AMERICAN HERO ??

394
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,428
?? I'M G.I. JOE... ??

395
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,429
DROP THE BARBIE.

396
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,931
DROP THE BARBIE.

397
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,432
G.I. JOE?

398
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,935
YOU REALLY THINK HE'S GOING TO FALL

399
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,936
FOR THAT?

400
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,937
G.I. JOE?

401
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,438
COOL. CAN I PLAY?

402
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,442
LOOK, BEN.

403
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,445
IT'S A TOY THAT PROTECTS U.S. OIL INTERESTS OVERSEAS.

404
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,447
GO, JOE! GO, JOE!

405
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,449
HELLO... OH.

406
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,951
PHOEBE, THERE YOU ARE.

407
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,952
NO. IT'S NOT. SORRY.

408
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,453
BUT, PHOEBE, WAIT. WAIT.

409
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,454
PHOEBE. PHOEBE.

410
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,956
OH, JOEY.

411
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,457
OH, OKAY.

412
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,960
SEE, I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU IN THOSE... PANTS.

413
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,462
LISTEN, THAT TV MOVIE I WENT IN FOR--

414
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,964
DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING?

415
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,465
I THINK I GOT A SHOT AT IT.

416
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,967
YES. THEY CALLED.

417
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,468
YOU DIDN'T GET IT.

418
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,971
OKAY? I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T GET IT.

419
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,472
I'M SORRY.

420
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,473
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

421
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,474
THAT'S OKAY.

422
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,475
THESE THINGS HAPPEN.

423
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,477
BUT THEY SHOULDN'T HAPPEN.

424
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,478
YOU KNOW WHAT?

425
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,481
YOU'RE IN A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE BUSINESS.

426
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,983
OH, GOD, I DON'T WANT TO BE

427
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,986
THE PERSON WHO MAKES YOUR FACE LOOK LIKE THAT.

428
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,990
I'M... I'M OKAY. SEE?

429
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,992
NOW YOU'RE SAD AND CREEPY.

430
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,493
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M SORRY.

431
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,494
I QUIT. OKAY?

432
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,996
NO, NO. YOU CAN'T QUIT.

433
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,998
YOU'RE THE BEST AGENT I EVER HAD.

434
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:39,999
LOOK, PHEEBS

435
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,501
REJECTION IS PART OF BEING AN ACTOR.

436
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,003
YOU CAN'T TAKE IT PERSONAL.

437
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,004
NOT PERSONAL? REALLY?

438
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,506
WELL, THEY SAID THEY'D NEVER MET AN ITALIAN ACTOR

439
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,507
WITH A WORSE ITALIAN ACCENT.

440
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,010
THEY ACTUALLY SAID THAT?

441
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,512
YEAH. OH, GOD, THERE'S THAT FACE AGAIN.

442
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,014
SEE? I CAN'T DO THIS JOB. I CAN'T.

443
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,516
NO, NO, SEE, THIS IS WHY YOU HAVE TO DO THIS JOB.

444
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,517
AGENTS ALWAYS LIE.

445
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,020
YOU KNOW, ESTELLE JUST SAYS STUFF LIKE

446
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,023
"THEY WENT ANOTHER WAY," BUT THIS-- I CAN USE THIS.

447
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,026
I CAN A WORK ON A YOU ACACENTAY.

448
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,527
YEAH. OKAY.

449
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,530
NO, IF IT HELPS YOU, OKAY, YEAH.

450
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,532
YOU'LL NEVER GET ME, JOE.

451
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,535

452
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,040

453
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,547
NO, THANK YOU.

454
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,551
CHANDLER.

455
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:36,055
HELLO... JANICE.

456
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,559
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

457
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,061
OH, JUST A BIT OF SHOPPING.

458
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,562
HOW'VE YOU BEEN?

459
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,566
ARE YOU BEING BRITISH?

460
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,569
NO. NOT ANYMORE.

461
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,072
WHY ARE YOU SHOPPING HERE?

462
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,074
YOU DON'T LIVE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

463
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,576
WERE YOU HERE WAITING FOR ME?

464
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,577

465
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,579
YA HUH.

466
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,082
I'M JUST, UH, YOU KNOW

467
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,085
PICKING UP SOME THINGS FOR A PARTY.

468
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,089
BARLEY?

469
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,591
WHAT KIND OF A PARTY SERVES BARLEY?

470
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,093
WELL, I'M SORRY IF MY FRIENDS

471
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,594
AREN'T AS SOPHISTICATED AS YOURS.

472
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,597
WHERE IS THIS PARTY?

473
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,598
HERE IN CHELSEA.

474
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,100
WHOSE PARTY IS IT?

475
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,601
A WOMAN'S.

476
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,103
WHAT WOMAN?

477
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,105
CHELSEA.

478
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,607
OKAY. YOU KNOW ONE OF TWO THINGS

479
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,109
IS HAPPENING HERE.

480
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,111
EITHER YOU'RE SEEING SOMEBODY BEHIND MY BACK

481
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,612
WHICH WOULD MAKE YOU

482
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,114
THE BIGGEST JERK ON THE PLANET

483
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,116
OR ELSE YOU'RE PRETENDING YOU'RE SEEING SOMEBODY

484
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,617
WHICH JUST MAKES YOU SO PATHETIC

485
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,120
I COULD JUST START CRYING HERE IN THE CEREAL AISLE.

486
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,622
SO, LIKE, WHICH OF THESE TWO GUYS

487
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,624
DO YOU WANT TO BE?

488
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,626
COULD I BE THAT GUY?

489
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,132
OKAY, SO WE GOT TWO MORE GOOD REJECTIONS--

490
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,134
LOTS OF STUFF TO WORK ON.

491
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,635
OH. OKAY, SHOOT.

492
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,138
OKAY. UM, OH, THE ZOO COMMERCIAL.

493
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,639
I DIDN'T GET IT?

494
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,641
NO. THEY SAID THAT YOU

495
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,644
"WEREN'T BELIEVABLE AS A HUMAN BEING."

496
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,646
SO, YOU CAN WORK ON THAT.

497
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,148
OKAY.

498
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,149
UH, WHAT ELSE?

499
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,151
UM, THE OFF BROADWAY PLAY PEOPLE SAID

500
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,653
THAT YOU WERE PRETTY BUT DUMB.

501
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,156
OH. OH, NO. WAIT. I'M SORRY.

502
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,158
THAT'S "PRETTY DUMB."

503
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,159
LOOK, THAT'S OKAY.

504
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,660
NO, NO, NO. REALLY.

505
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,663
LOOK, UM, I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS, PHEEBS

506
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,665
BUT... I THINK I'M GOING

507
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,667
TO HAVE TO GO BACK TO ESTELLE.

508
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,169
OH. DON'T GET ME WRONG.

509
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,172
YOU'RE A BETTER AGENT THAN SHE IS, BUT AT LEAST WITH HER

510
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,675
I DON'T WANT TO BLOW MY PRETTY DUMB BRAINS OUT.

511
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,177
YEAH. I KNOW.

512
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,678
I UNDERSTAND.

513
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,679
YOU DO? THANKS.

514
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,680
YEAH.

515
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,681
OKAY.

516
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,183
SORRY.

517
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,184
WAIT A MINUTE.

518
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,685
WHAT?

519
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,686
WAIT A MINUTE.

520
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,189
DID YOU JUST MAKE ALL THAT STUFF UP

521
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,690
TO GET OUT OF BEING MY AGENT?

522
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,193
OOH, YOU CAUGHT ME.

523
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,194
HUH.

524
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,197
I AM SO BUSTED.

525
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,701
THAT'S A WHAT I SUSPECTED A.

526
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,703
HUH?

527
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,206
AND THEN I JUST, YOU KNOW...

528
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,208
THREW THE BAG OF BARLEY AT HER

529
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,709
AND RAN OUT OF THE STORE.

530
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,212
OH, MY GOD, CHANDLER.

531
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,714
WE SAID, "BE ALOOF," NOT "A DOOF."

532
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,219
I'VE ACTUALLY RUINED THIS, HAVEN'T I?

533
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,223
IT'S TIME FOR THE GOOD ICE CREAM NOW, RIGHT?

534
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,724
IT'S TIME.

535
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,226
YEAH, IT IS.

536
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,728
YOU KNOW WHAT?

537
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,730
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

538
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,232
YOU KNOW WHY?

539
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,234
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT 65 GRAMS OF FAT

540
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,735
COMING YOUR WAY.

541
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,737

542
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,240
HELLO.

543
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,741
HI, JANICE.

544
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,744
CAN YOU HOLD ON FOR A SECOND?

545
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,745
OKAY.

546
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,746
OKAY, WHAT DO I DO?

547
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,248
SHOOT, I DON'T KNOW.

548
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,250
THIS IS TOTALLY UNPRECEDENTED.

549
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,751
IF WE EVER DID WHAT YOU DID

550
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,752
A MAN WOULD NEVER CALL.

551
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,254
NO, NO... OKAY, I GOT IT.

552
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,256
PRETEND THAT YOU JUST WOKE UP.

553
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,757
THAT'LL THROW HER OFF. BE SLEEPY.

554
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,759
YES, AND GRUMPY.

555
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,762
STOP NAMING DWARFS.

556
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,766
HELLO, JANICE.

557
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,268
HI.

558
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,270
I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU CALLED.

559
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,775
I KNOW I'VE BEEN ACTING REALLY WEIRD... LATELY, AND...
