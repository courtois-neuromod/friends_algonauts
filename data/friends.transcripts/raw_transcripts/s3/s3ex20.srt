1
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:04,037
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT.

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,039
YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS ACTRESS PERSON

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,273
IS THE ONLY WOMAN YOU EVER WANTED

4
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:08,775
WHO DIDN'T WANT YOU BACK?

5
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:10,276
YEAH. OH, MY GOD.

6
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,779
IS THIS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE YOU?

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,282
WOW, YOU'RE REALLY CRAZY ABOUT HER, HUH?

8
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:17,784
OH, YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

9
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,285
AND WHEN WE'RE ONSTAGE

10
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:20,787
I GET TO KISS HER AND TOUCH HER

11
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:23,289
BUT THEN SHE GOES HOME WITH THE DIRECTOR

12
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:26,026
AND IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY'S RIPPING OUT MY HEART.

13
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,029
OH, IT'S SO GREAT TO SEE YOU FEELING LIKE THIS.

14
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,032
HEY.

15
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,533
 HEY.

16
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,536
MONICA, DAD CALLED THIS MORNING, AND, UH...

17
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,539
AUNT SYLVIA PASSED AWAY.

18
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,042
YES!

19
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,044
YES! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!

20
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,549
WE WERE ALL PRETTY SHAKEN UP ABOUT IT.

21
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,051
WAIT, AM I MISSING SOMETHING, THOUGH?

22
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,054
BECAUSE I ALWAYS THOUGHT DEATH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SAD IN A WAY.

23
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,057
WELL, AUNT SYLVIA WAS...

24
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,059
WELL, NOT A NICE PERSON.

25
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,562
NO, SHE WAS A CRUEL, CRANKY, OLD BITCH.

26
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,565
AND I'M SORRY SHE DIED.

27
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,068
DID DAD SAY I GET THE DOLLHOUSE?

28
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,070
YOU GET THE DOLLHOUSE.

29
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,571
I GET THE DOLLHOUSE!

30
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,575
WOW. A HOUSE FOR DOLLS.

31
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,576
THAT IS SO COOL.

32
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:20,080
WHEN I WAS A KID, I HAD A BARREL.

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,083
UH, PHEEBS, YOU HAD A BARREL FOR A DOLLHOUSE?

34
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,085
NO, JUST A BARREL.

35
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,086
YOU KNOW WHAT?

36
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,588
YOU CAN PLAY WITH MY DOLLHOUSE.

37
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,090
REALLY? REALLY?

38
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,091
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

39
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,092
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER

40
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,593
ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS PLAY

41
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,095
WITH THIS DOLLHOUSE.

42
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,096
BUT NO.

43
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,098
IT WAS TO BE LOOKED AT BUT NEVER PLAYED WITH.

44
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,101
MY GRANDMOTHER USED TO SAY THAT EXACT SAME THING TO ME.

45
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,606
MORE OF A BATHTUB TYPE SITUATION.

46
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,608
MONICA, SHE DID GIVE YOU ONE CHANCE.

47
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,111
SHE TOLD MONICA SHE COULD PLAY WITH THE DOLLHOUSE

48
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,612
IF SHE LOST 20 POUNDS.

49
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,116
YEAH, WELL, LOOK WHO'S LOSING WEIGHT NOW, AUNT SYLVIA.

50
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,623

51
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:08,628
?  ?

52
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,131
?  ?

53
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,633
?  ?

54
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,137
?  ?

55
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,140
?  ?

56
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,143
?  ?

57
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:27,147
?  ?

58
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,649
?  ?

59
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,152
?  ?

60
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,154
?  ?

61
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,157
?  ?

62
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:43,663
?  ?

63
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:46,666
HEY, SOPHIE.

64
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:47,667
HEY, RACH. HEY.

65
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,669
THANKS FOR LUNCH, CHANDLER.

66
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,671
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WALK ME ALL THE WAY BACK UP HERE.

67
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,173
OH, THAT'S OKAY.

68
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,675
NO PROBLEM.

69
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,177
UM, HONEY, YOU DO REALIZE

70
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,679
WE DON'T KEEP THE WOMEN'S LINGERIE

71
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,181
HERE IN THE OFFICE.

72
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,685
YES, I REALIZE THAT.

73
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,686
SUMMER CATALOGUE?

74
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,688
THAT'S THE STUFF.

75
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,192
RACHEL, I NEED THE VERSACE INVOICE.

76
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,193
HELLO.

77
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,694
YOU DON'T WORK FOR ME.

78
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,197
JOANNA, THIS IS MY FRIEND, CHANDLER BING.

79
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,198
JOANNA.

80
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,199
BING.

81
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,700
THAT'S A GREAT NAME.

82
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,203
THANKS. IT'S GAELIC FOR "THY TURKEY'S DONE."

83
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,208
SO, I'M GOING TO GO. NICE MEETING YOU.

84
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,709
YOU, TOO.

85
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,211
BYE, CHANDLER.

86
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:35,215
SO, UH, WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

87
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,216
OH, NOTHING.

88
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,717
HE'S JUST GOOFY LIKE THAT.

89
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,719
I ACTUALLY HARDLY NOTICE IT ANYMORE.

90
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,721
OH, NO, NO, NO.

91
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,723
I MEAN, IS HE...

92
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,225
MARRIED OR INVOLVED WITH ANYONE?

93
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,226
NO, NO.

94
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,728
HE'S NOT MARRIED OR INVOLVED.

95
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,729
WITH ANYONE.

96
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,232
WELL, RACHEL...

97
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,733
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

98
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,734
FORGET IT.

99
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,237
I'LL ASK HIM FOR YOU IF YOU WANT ME TO.

100
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,738
WOULD YOU?

101
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,240
OR IS IT JUST TOO SAD AND DESPERATE--

102
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,742
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT SOPHIE WOULD DO?

103
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,743
I AM HERE.

104
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,245
I KNOW THAT.

105
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,748
LOOK AT IT.

106
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,751
OH, WALLPAPER'S A LITTLE FADED.

107
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,752
THAT'S OKAY.

108
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,255
CARPET'S A LITTLE LOOSE.

109
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,756
HARDWOOD FLOORS!

110
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,759
HEY.

111
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,760
 HELLO.

112
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,761
OH!

113
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,764
OH, MONICA, IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL!

114
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,267
I KNOW!

115
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,769
SO I'M HERE, READY TO PLAY.

116
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,770
OKAY.

117
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,773
I BROUGHT A BUNCH OF STUFF FOR THE HOUSE.

118
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,275
SO CHECK IT OUT.

119
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,279
WHAT'S THIS?

120
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,780
THAT'S A DOG.

121
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,282
EVERY HOUSE SHOULD HAVE A DOG.

122
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,784
NOT ONE THAT CAN PEE ON THE ROOF.

123
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,288
WELL, MAYBE IT'S SO BIG

124
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,791
BECAUSE THE HOUSE WAS BUILT ON RADIOACTIVE WASTE.

125
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,796
AND IS THIS IN CASE THE HOUSE SNEEZES?

126
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,800
NO, NO.

127
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,303
THAT'S THE GHOST FOR THE ATTIC.

128
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,305
I DON'T WANT A GHOST.

129
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,307
WELL, NOBODY WANTS A GHOST.

130
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,810
BUT YOU'VE GOT ONE.

131
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,313
BECAUSE THE HOUSE IS SITTING ON

132
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,815
AN ANCIENT INDIAN BURIAL GROUND.

133
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,317
 WAIT A MINUTE.

134
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,320
THE HOUSE WAS BUILT ON RADIOACTIVE WASTE

135
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,323
AND AN ANCIENT INDIAN BURIAL GROUND?

136
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,325
THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN.

137
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:29,329
OKAY, OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

138
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,332
HEY.

139
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,833
 HEY.

140
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,835
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

141
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,337
SURE. WHAT'S UP?

142
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,338
OH, SORRY.

143
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,340
I MEANT CHANDLER.

144
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,343
I I KNOW.

145
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,847
WELL, IF SOMETHING COMES UP...

146
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,851
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU GUYS

147
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,854
HAVE PASSED THAT LITTLE AWKWARD PHASE.

148
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,856
OKAY, MY BOSS, JOANNA.

149
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:01,361
WHEN YOU LEFT, SHE STARTED ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT YOU.

150
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,863
OH, LIKED WHAT SHE SAW, HUH?

151
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,867
DUG MY ACTION, DID SHE?

152
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,871
CHECKIN' OUT THE CHAN CHAN MAN!

153
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,878
THAT WAS... SURREAL.

154
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,879
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

155
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,381
YOU INTERESTED AT ALL?

156
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,884
YEAH, SHE SEEMED COOL, ATTRACTIVE.

157
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,885
I'LL DO IT.

158
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,387
OH, THANK YOU, CHANDLER.

159
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,388
THIS IS SO GREAT.

160
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,889
SHE'S GOING TO LOVE ME.

161
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,890
HEY, DINOSAUR ATTACK.

162
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,892
QUICK, EVERYBODY INTO THE HOUSE.

163
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,893
AHH!

164
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,395
RUFF! RUFF!

165
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,396
ALL RIGHT, PHOEBE.

166
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,897
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S IT.

167
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,898
THAT'S IT.

168
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,900
NO DINOSAURS, NO GHOSTS

169
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,402
NO GIANT DOGS, OKAY?

170
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,903
THEY'RE NOT THE RIGHT SIZE

171
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,405
THEY'RE NOT VICTORIAN

172
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,906
AND THEY JUST DON'T GO.

173
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,908
OKAY.

174
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,910
FINE.

175
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,412
COME, DINOSAUR.

176
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,915
WE'RE NOT WELCOME IN THE HOUSE OF NO IMAGINATION.

177
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,919
PHEEBS, WHILE WE'RE HOVERING AROUND THE SUBJECT

178
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,422
I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT DINOSAURS

179
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,923
THEY DON'T GO "RUFF."

180
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,926
THE LITTLE ONES DO.

181
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,935
HEY, KATE.

182
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,437
MORNING.

183
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,438
LISTEN, I WENT TO THAT RESTAURANT

184
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,939
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT LAST WEEK...

185
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,940
 HEY, LOVELY.

186
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,943
COME TALK TO ME FOR A MINUTE.

187
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,944
THEN I ATE THE FOOD.

188
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,946
IT WAS GOOD. I HAD THE FISH.

189
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,450
HI.

190
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,452
I'M LAUREN, KATE'S UNDER STUDY.

191
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,454
OH, HEY. JOEY TRIBBIANI.

192
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,455
I KNOW.

193
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,457
I'M A BIG FAN OF YOURS.

194
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,959
WHAT?

195
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,462
I USED TO SCHEDULE MY CLASSES

196
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,964
SO I COULD WATCH DR. DRAKE RAMORAY

197
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,466
ON DAYS OF OUR LIVES.

198
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,467
GET OUT OF HERE.

199
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,468
REALLY?

200
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,469
ABSOLUTELY.

201
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,970
OH, BUT THEN THEY WENT

202
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,972
AND DROPPED YOU DOWN THAT ELEVATOR SHAFT.

203
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,974
THEY GAVE ME THE SHAFT, ALL RIGHT.

204
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,976

205
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,978
YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

206
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,980
LISTEN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING AFTER REHEARSAL?

207
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,982
DO YOU WANT TO GET A DRINK OR SOMETHING?

208
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,985
WELL, UH...

209
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,989
YEAH. YEAH, SURE.

210
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,991
A DRINK SOUNDS GREAT.

211
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,992
COOL.

212
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,993
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

213
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:14,994
ALL RIGHT.

214
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,500
ALL RIGHT, IT'S TIME TO ACT

215
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,002
MY TALKING PROPS.

216
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,510
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THE BOYS' BATHROOM REALISTIC

217
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,011
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT

218
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,514
SOME TEENY, TINY PORNO MAGAZINES BEHIND THE TOILET.

219
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,517
HEY.

220
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,018
 HEY.

221
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,520
LOOK, EVERYBODY. LOOK AT MY NEW DOLLHOUSE.

222
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,522
WOW!

223
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,526
OH!

224
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,527
LOOK, LOOK.

225
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,529

226
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,031
HEY, WHAT'S THIS?

227
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,034
OH, OKAY, IT'S A SLIDE INSTEAD OF STAIRS.

228
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,035
LOOK.

229
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,037
OH!

230
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,539
VERY INTERESTING, PHOEBE.

231
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,042
WHAT'S THIS?

232
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,544
THE LICORICE ROOM.

233
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,047
YOU CAN EAT ALL THE FURNITURE.

234
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,549
AND WHEN GUESTS COME OVER

235
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:13,052
THEY CAN STAY ON THE TOOTSIE ROLL A WAY BED.

236
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,055
THIS IS THE COOLEST HOUSE EVER!

237
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,058
HEY, DOES ANYONE WANT TO JOIN ME

238
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,059
IN THE AROMA ROOM?

239
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,060
ALL RIGHT.

240
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,061
I WOULD.

241
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,563
HEY, GUYS.

242
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,566
GUYS, DID YOU SEE MY NEW CHINA CABINET?

243
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,067
UH HUH. UH HUH.

244
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,070
WATCH. WATCH.

245
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,572
OOH! OOH!

246
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,574
AND, AND...

247
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,077
AH! AH!

248
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:42,081
HEY, MY FATHER'S HOUSE DOES THAT.

249
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,583
OKAY, HOW DID IT GO?

250
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,084
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

251
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,587
WELL, THE MOVIE WAS GREAT.

252
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,088
THE DINNER WAS GREAT.

253
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,091
AND THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A COOL, CRISP NEW YORK EVENING.

254
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,093
OF COURSE, I DIDN'T GET TO ENJOY ANY OF THAT

255
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,596
BECAUSE JOANNA'S SUCH A BIG, DULL DUD.

256
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,600
CHANDLER IS FANTASTIC!

257
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,601
WHAT?

258
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,603
OH, GOD, WE JUST CLICKED. YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE JUST CLICK?

259
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,105
LIKE, HE CAME BY TO PICK ME UP AND I OPENED THE DOOR

260
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,607
AND IT WAS JUST LIKE, "CLICK."

261
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,108
DID HE TELL YOU?

262
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,110
OH, AND HE'S GOT SUCH A GOOD HEART.

263
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,612
DOESN'T HE HAVE A GOOD HEART?

264
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,613
OH, I KNOW, AND HE'S SO SWEET.

265
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,114
LISTEN, HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO CALL

266
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,116
SO PUT HIM STRAIGHT THROUGH.

267
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,117
ISN'T THIS GREAT?

268
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,119
DON'T SPOIL IT.

269
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,623
COME ON, BABY, DON'T GO.

270
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,124
PLEASE.

271
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,125
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

272
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,627

273
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,628
HELLO?

274
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,129
OH, IT'S YOU.

275
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,131
JUST ONE SEC.

276
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,635
I AM GOING TO TAKE THIS CALL.

277
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:40,139
WHEN I CONTINUE, I HOPE THAT THERE WILL APPEAR ON STAGE

278
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,643
THIS MAGICAL THING THAT, IN THE THEATER, WE CALL

279
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,647
COMMITTING TO THE MOMENT!

280
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,652
THE GUY'S LIKE A CARTOON.

281
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,655
WHAT DO YOU SEE IN HIM, ANYWAY?

282
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,658
HE HAPPENS TO BE BRILLIANT.

283
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,660
WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY

284
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,162
FOR THAT SWEATER YOU'RE DATING.

285
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,665
HEY, I'M NOT INTERESTED IN HER SWEATER.

286
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,668
IT'S WHAT'S UNDERNEATH HER SWEATER THAT COUNTS.

287
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,675
AND BESIDES, SINCE WHEN DO YOU CARE WHO I'M GOING OUT WITH?

288
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,676
I DON'T CARE.

289
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,678
WHY? DO YOU WANT ME TO CARE?

290
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,681
DO YOU WANT ME TO WANT YOU TO CARE?

291
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,683
DO YOU?

292
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,685
WHAT?

293
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,187
OKAY, I'M AFRAID TO SAY THIS

294
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,189
BUT LET'S PICK IT UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

295
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,699
COME ON, BABY, DON'T GO.

296
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,700
PLEASE?

297
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,701
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

298
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,703
I'VE GOT NO REASON TO STAY.

299
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,207
STOP!

300
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,709
STOP IT!

301
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,210
YOU MUST STOP!

302
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,716
YOU ARE BAD ACTORS.

303
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,719
THIS IS A TERRIBLE PLAY.

304
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,221
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

305
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,226
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE GO ON IN A WEEK.

306
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,730
HEY, IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

307
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,732
SO, SINCE WE'RE GETTING OFF EARLY

308
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,233
DO YOU WANT TO GO AND PAINT MUGS?

309
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,737
WHAT?

310
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,741
YOU KNOW, AT THE PLACE I TOLD YOU ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

311
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,744
OH, YEAH. WITH THE MUG PAINTING.

312
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,745
YEAH.

313
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,247
I WAS SO LISTENING TO THAT.

314
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,749
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

315
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,251
I THINK I KIND OF NEED TO WORK ON MY STUFF TONIGHT.

316
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,753
OH, OKAY.

317
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,254
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

318
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,756
OKAY.

319
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,260
OKAY.

320
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,762
GOOD NIGHT.

321
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,769
UH... ARE YOU OKAY?

322
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,270
YEAH, I GUESS.

323
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,775
LOOK, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THE SCENE, HUH?

324
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,276
I DON'T KNOW.

325
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,278
WELL, UM...

326
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,282
MAYBE IF IT HAD MORE HEAT.

327
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,784
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

328
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,285
WELL...

329
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,789
ADRIENNE'S LOOKING FOR A REASON TO STAY, RIGHT?

330
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,792
VICTOR CAN'T JUST KISS HER.

331
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,293
HE'S GOT TO...

332
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,295
HE'S GOT TO REALLY GIVE HER A REASON, YOU KNOW?

333
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,298
MAYBE HE COULD SLIP HER THE TONGUE.

334
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,806
OR MAYBE...

335
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,808
MAYBE HE COULD GRAB HER AND...

336
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,810
AND LIFT HER UP.

337
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,311
YEAH, AND THEN ADRIENNE

338
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,314
MAYBE SHE COULD WRAP HER LEGS AROUND HIS WAIST.

339
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,317
YEAH, SHE COULD DO THAT.

340
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,320
AND... AND... AND CLAW AT HIS BACK.

341
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,322
YEAH, RIGHT, AND... AND THEN SHE COULD

342
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,824
RIP OFF HIS SHIRT AND KISS HIS CHEST

343
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,325
AND HIS... HIS STOMACH.

344
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,327
AND THEN HE CAN USE HIS TEETH...

345
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,329
HIS TEETH TO UNDO HER DRESS AND... AND...

346
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,831
AND BITE HER.

347
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,334
AND THEN, RIGHT WHEN THE SCENE ENDS

348
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,839
HE COULD TAKE HER WITH THIS RAW, ANIMAL...

349
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,342

350
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,344
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

351
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,347
YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

352
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:09,849
YEAH.

353
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,864
HI. HEY.

354
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,872
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY TO BE DRINKING.

355
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,373
NO, NO.

356
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,376
THINGS, UH, FINALLY HAPPENED WITH KATE.

357
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,878
OH, YOU'RE KIDDING.

358
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,379
THAT'S GREAT.

359
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,381
OH, IT WAS SO AMAZING.

360
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,383
AFTER THE... LOVE MAKING...

361
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,384
OH, MY.

362
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,886
I JUST...

363
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,389
I JUST WATCHED HER SLEEP FOR, LIKE, HOURS

364
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,392
JUST BREATHING IN AND BREATHING OUT.

365
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,896
AND THEN I KNEW SHE WAS DREAMING

366
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,898
BECAUSE HER EYES KEPT GOING LIKE THIS...

367
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,906
I'M TELLING YOU, JOANNE'S GOT IT ALL WRONG, OKAY?

368
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,408
ALL I SAID WAS, "THIS WAS FUN.

369
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,410
"LET'S DO IT AGAIN SOMETIME.

370
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,912
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL."

371
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,413
OH, GEE

372
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,416
I WONDER WHY SHE THINKS YOU WERE GOING TO CALL HER.

373
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,419
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY AT THE END OF A DATE.

374
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,420
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY

375
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,422
"NICE TO MEET YOU. GOOD NIGHT"?

376
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,924
TO HER FACE?

377
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,929
I'M SO HAPPY.

378
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,431
LOOK, IT'S THE END OF THE DATE-- I'M STANDING THERE--

379
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,933
I KNOW ALL SHE'S WAITING FOR

380
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,434
IS FOR ME TO SAY I'LL CALL HER

381
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,435
AND IT JUST COMES OUT.

382
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,436
I CAN'T HELP IT.

383
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,938
IT'S A COMPULSION.

384
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,439
COME ON, RACH.

385
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,441
WHEN A GUY SAYS HE'S GOING TO CALL

386
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,444
IT DOESN'T MEAN HE'S GOING TO CALL.

387
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,445
THIS NEVER HAPPENED

388
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,947
TO YOU?

389
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,448
WELL, THEY ALWAYS CALLED.

390
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,450
BITE ME.

391
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,458
DID HE CALL?

392
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,459
NO. SORRY.

393
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,460
WHY? WHY?

394
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,962
HE SAID HE'D CALL.

395
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,463
WHY HASN'T HE CALLED?

396
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,965
MAYBE HE'S INTIMIDATED

397
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,467
BY REALLY SMART, STRONG, SUCCESSFUL WOMEN.

398
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,970
SOPHIE, WILL YOU PLEASE CLIMB OUT OF MY BUTT.

399
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,974
WHY HASN'T HE CALLED, RACHEL? WHY?

400
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,975
OKAY, OKAY.

401
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,476
UM, WELL, UH...

402
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,480
MAYBE HE FEELS AWKWARD BECAUSE YOU ARE MY BOSS.

403
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,482
AWKWARD? WHY SHOULD HE FEEL AWKWARD?

404
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,484
THE ONLY ONE PERSON THAT SHOULD FEEL AWKWARD IS YOU

405
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,486
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM NOT TO CALL ME, DID YOU?

406
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,988
NO, I...

407
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,990
BECAUSE IF YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE

408
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,492
WITH YOUR FRIEND DATING SOMEONE YOU WORK FOR

409
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,995
THERE ARE ALWAYS WAYS TO FIX THAT.

410
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,498
CALL HER. CALL HER NOW.

411
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,002
MULTIPLE... SO MANY PAPER CUTS.

412
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,004
"WHY HASN'T HE CALLED, RACHEL?

413
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,505
"WHY? WHY? I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

414
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,507
"HE SAID HE'D CALL. WHY?

415
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,509
I'M TELLING YOU, SHE'S FLIPPED OUT.

416
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,011
SHE'S GONE CRAZY.

417
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,513
OH. WELL, GIVE ME THE PHONE THEN.

418
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,514
THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

419
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,017
SHE THINKS IT'S MY FAULT THAT YOU HAVEN'T CALLED HER.

420
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,518
YOU HAVE TO CALL HER.

421
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,021
LOOK, YOU CAN'T CALL SOMEBODY AFTER THIS LONG JUST TO SAY

422
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,024
"IN CASE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE, I DON'T LIKE YOU."

423
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,027
WELL, THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE HER OUT AGAIN.

424
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,528
NO. SHE'S REALLY DULL

425
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,531
AND SHE GETS THIS GROSS MASCARA GOOP THING

426
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,533
IN THE CORNER OF HER EYE.

427
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,535
I DON'T CARE. I DON'T CARE.

428
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,038
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE HER OUT AGAIN AND END IT

429
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,041
AND END IT IN A WAY THAT SHE KNOWS IT'S ACTUALLY ENDED.

430
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,043
AND I DON'T CARE HOW HARD IT IS FOR YOU.

431
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,545
DO NOT TELL HER THAT YOU WILL CALL HER AGAIN.

432
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,048
ALL RIGHT, FINE, BUT IT'S JUST A LUNCH DATE-- NO MORE THAN AN HOUR.

433
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,050
AND FROM NOW ON, I GET MY OWN DATES.

434
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,552
I DON'T WANT YOU SETTING ME UP WITH ANYBODY EVER AGAIN.

435
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,054
THAT'S FINE.

436
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,556
THAT'S JUST A LOT OF BIG TALK, YOU KNOW.

437
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,557
I KNOW.

438
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,061

439
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,562
MON?

440
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,064
IN THE SHOWER!

441
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,078
OH! FIRE! THERE'S A FIRE! FIRE!

442
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,105

443
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,110
HEY.

444
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,611
HI.

445
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,113
SO, I, UH...

446
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,614
TALKED TO LAUREN.

447
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,117
KIND OF TOLD HER HOW THINGS WERE WITH US.

448
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,619
DID YOU, UH, DID YOU TALK TO MARSHALL?

449
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,621
ABOUT WHAT?

450
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:46,625
YOU KNOW, ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH US.

451
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,626
NO.

452
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,129
AND THERE'S REALLY NO REASON

453
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,630
WHY HE SHOULD FIND OUT

454
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,134
SO, UH, LET'S NOT MAKE A BIG DEAL OF IT, OKAY?

455
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,138
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

456
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,640
IT WAS A BIG DEAL.

457
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,142
I MEAN... COME ON

458
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,644
YOU CAN'T TELL ME LAST NIGHT DIDN'T MEAN SOMETHING TO YOU.

459
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,146
I WAS THERE.

460
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,149
YOU'RE NOT THAT GOOD AN ACTRESS.

461
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:14,153
LOOK, UM, I WAS JUST CAUGHT UP IN THE MOMENT.

462
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,656
THAT'S ALL IT WAS.

463
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,658
JOEY, I'M SORRY YOU FEEL BAD, BUT...

464
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,660
HAVEN'T YOU EVER SLEPT WITH A WOMAN

465
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,163
WHERE IT MEANT MORE TO HER THAN IT DID TO YOU?

466
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,165
NO.

467
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,667
HI, KATE.

468
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,169
HI, LAUREN.

469
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,172
HI, LAUREN.

470
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,174
HI, PIG.

471
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,179
SORRY I, UH...

472
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,680
I SCARED YOU IN THERE.

473
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,182
OH, THAT'S OKAY.

474
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,683
BY THE WAY

475
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,687
I WAS JUST CHECKING THE SHOWER MASSAGER.

476
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,190
YEAH. SHH...

477
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,191
HEY.

478
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,693
WE TRIED TO REACH YOU AT WORK.

479
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,695
THERE'S... BEEN A FIRE.

480
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,197
WHAT?

481
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,199
OH, MY... OH, MY GOD!

482
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,202
WHAT HAPPENED?

483
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,705
WELL, WE BELIEVE IT ORIGINATED HERE...

484
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:10,209
IN THE AROMA ROOM.

485
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,711
DID EVERYONE GET OUT OKAY?

486
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,215
WELL, THE GIRAFFE'S OKAY AND SO IS THE PIRATE.

487
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,216
WHAT IS THIS?

488
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,718
NO, PHOEBE, DON'T LOOK.

489
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,221
YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE WHAT'S UNDER THERE.

490
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,722

491
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,224
THE FOSTER PUPPETS!

492
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,229
 IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

493
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,732
IT'S JUST IT'S RIGHT HERE, AND IT'S ALL THE TIME.

494
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,733
OH.

495
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,738
WELL, THANKS AGAIN FOR LUNCH.

496
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,243
YES, THIS... THIS WAS PLEASANT.

497
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,745
IT WAS, WASN'T IT?

498
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,747
THE FOOD THERE WAS GREAT.

499
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,249
WASN'T IT?

500
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,253
SO TAKE CARE.

501
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,255
YOU, TOO.

502
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,256
WELL, THIS WAS GREAT.

503
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,757
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL.

504
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,259
WE SHOULD DO IT AGAIN SOMETIME.

505
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,761
GREAT. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

506
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,763
RACHEL, ANY MESSAGES?

507
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,265
SOPHIE'S DESK.

508
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,768
CHANDLER...

509
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,270
ARE YOU GOING TO CALL HER?

510
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,271
NO.

511
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,272
CHANDLER...

512
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,773
LOOK, I'M SORRY, OKAY?

513
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,775
I'M WEAK AND PATHETIC AND SORRY.

514
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,777
OKAY, YOU ARE GOING TO TELL HER.

515
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,279
YOU ARE GOING TO TELL HER NOW.

516
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,281
I'M NOT GOING TO CALL YOU.

517
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,784
WHAT?

518
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,791
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY THAT I SAID

519
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,793
I WAS GOING TO WHEN I'M NOT.

520
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,795
IT'S JUST I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE NICE

521
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:40,299
AND YOU DON'T DESERVE THAT.

522
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,802
I SEE... I THINK.

523
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,305
LOOK, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

524
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,308
AND THIS ISN'T RACHEL'S FAULT. IT'S ME.

525
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:54,313
I HAVE SERIOUS, SERIOUS PROBLEMS WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN.

526
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,816
I HAVE ISSUES WITH COMMITMENT, INTIMACY...

527
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,318
MASCARA GOOP.

528
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,822
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.

529
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,324
IT'S JUST THAT THIS IS NOT...

530
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,326
THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK OUT.

531
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:13,332
WELL, THIS ISN'T HOW I WAS HOPING THIS WOULD END

532
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,835
BUT I GUESS I HAVE TO APPRECIATE YOUR HONESTY.

533
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,838
YEAH. OKAY.

534
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,341
SO...

535
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,344
WELL, THIS WAS GREAT.

536
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,845
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL.

537
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,347
WE SHOULD DO IT AGAIN SOMETIME.

538
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:36,355
SO, ANYWAY, BETH, WHAT I'M SAYING IS

539
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,357
I SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED YOUR FEELINGS

540
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,359
BEFORE I WENT HOME WITH YOU THAT NIGHT.

541
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,860
I'VE, UH...

542
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,363
I'VE RECENTLY LEARNED WHAT IT'S LIKE

543
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,864
TO BE ON YOUR SIDE OF IT

544
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,366
AND I'M SORRY.

545
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:52,371
SO, DO YOU THINK YOU CAN FORGIVE ME?

546
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,872
GREAT.

547
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:54,873
THANKS.

548
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,874
OKAY.

549
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,875
BYE.

550
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,879
WHEW.

552
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,385
HELLO. JENNIFER?

553
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,886
