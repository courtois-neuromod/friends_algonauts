1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,005
I'M TELLING YOU, THAT GIRL TOTALLY WINKED AT ME.

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,006
SHE DID NOT WINK AT YOU.

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,508
NOBODY'S WINKING AT YOU.

4
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,516
HUH.

18
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,073
I HAVE TO SAY "TUPELO HONEY" BY VAN MORRISON.

19
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,574
NO WAY.

20
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,577
THE MOST ROMANTIC SONG EVER WAS "THE WAY WE WERE."

21
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,080
SEE, I THINK THE ONE THAT ELTON JOHN WROTE

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,582
FOR, UM, THAT GUY ONWHO'S THE BOSS?

23
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,585
WHAT SONG IS THAT, PHEEBS?

24
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,087
UM...

25
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,589
 HOLD ME CLOSE, YOUNG TONY DANZA...

26
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,595
HI, MONICA.

27
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,596
HEY, MON.

28
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,099
HEY, MON.

29
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,602
OH, MY GOD, HAS SHE SLEPT AT ALL?

30
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,104
NOPE.

31
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,106
NO. IT'S BEEN THREE NIGHTS IN A ROW.

32
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,108
YEAH, SHE FINALLY STOPPED CRYING YESTERDAY

33
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,109
BUT THEN SHE FOUND ONE

34
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,610
ONE OF RICHARD'S CIGAR BUTTS

35
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,611
OUT ON THE TERRACE...

36
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,113
OKAY. THAT EXPLAINS IT.

37
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,615
I GOT A CALL AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING

38
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,618
AND ALL I COULD HEAR WAS LIKE THIS HIGH SQUEAKY SOUND

39
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,620
SO I THOUGHT, "OH, OKAY.

40
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,622
SO IT'S LIKE A MOUSE OR A POSSUM."

41
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,624
THEN I REALIZED LIKE, OKAY

42
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,626
WHERE WOULD A MOUSE OR A POSSUM

43
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,629
GET THE MONEY TO MAKE THE PHONE CALL?

44
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,632
MORNING.

45
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,134
 MORNING.

46
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,136
HEY, YOU MADE PANCAKES?

47
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:20,640
YEAH. LIKE THERE'S ANY WAY I COULD EVER DO THAT.

48
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,144
































































































































 MONICA AND RACHEL HAD SYRUP

00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,645

00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,648

52
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,650
GOOD MORNING, JOEY.

53
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,153

00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,157
IT'S GOT TO BE YOU, MAN.

56
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,658
I'M WEARING SMARTY PANTS.

57
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,660
OKAY, HERE WE  GO.

58
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,164
ONE, TWO, AND HERE'S MY CHANCE

59
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,667
TO GIVE YOU A THIRD ONE.

60
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,668
JOEY?

61
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,669
NO, NO.

62
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,671
I'LL JUST HAVE JUICE.

63
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,672
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

64
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,673
HERE'S A THOUGHT.

65
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,675
WHY DON'T YOU STAY HOME FROM WORK TODAY

66
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,676
AND HANG OUT WITH ME?

67
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,178
OH, I WISH.

68
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,679
LISTEN, HONEY, YOU HAVE THAT REPORT TO FINISH

69
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,681
AND I'VE GOT TO  GO SEE MY LAWYER.

70
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,183
I CANNOT BELIEVE I'M GOING OUT

71
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,684
WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S GETTING DIVORCED.

72
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,186
I'M SUCH A GROWNUP.

73
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,687

74
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,690
JOEY, HEY! GO TO YOUR ROOM!

75
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,194
CHANDLER, HEY! UP YOURS!

76
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,196
I GOT TO GO. I GOT TO GO.

77
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,697
OKAY, NOT WITHOUT A KISS.

78
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,200
WELL, MAYBE I WON'T KISS YOU, AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO STAY.

79
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,702
KISS HER. KISS HER.

80
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,204
MMM WA. MMM.

81
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,206

00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,712
SO, WHEN YOU DUMPING HER?

NOPE.

87
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,215
NOT THIS TIME.

88
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,218
COME ON. QUIT YANKING ME.

89
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,223
I'M NOT YANKING YOU.

90
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,224

91
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,725
THIS IS JANICE.

92
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,726
YEAH. I KNOW.

93
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,728
SHE MAKES ME HAPPY.

94
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,730
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

95
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,734
YOU LOOK ME IN THE EYE AND TELL ME WITHOUT BLINKING

96
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,237
THAT YOU'RE NOT BREAKING UP WITH HER.

97
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,738
NO BLINKING.

98
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,243
I'M NOT BREAKING UP WITH HER.

99
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,751
HEY...

100
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,254
OH, GOD, LOOK WHAT I FOUND IN THE DRAIN.

101
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,755
WHAT?

102
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,758
IT'S SOME OF RICHARD'S HAIR.

103
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,760
WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS?

104
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,264
GETTING IT AWAY FROM ME WOULD BE JOB ONE.

105
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,765
IT'S WEIRD , BUT, YOU KNOW

106
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,767
I DON'T WANT TO THROW THIS AWAY.

107
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,770
I MEAN, THIS IS LIKE ALL I HAVE LEFT OF HIM--

108
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,274
GROSS... DRAIN HAIR.

109
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,276
EWW!

110
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,782
COOL. OH, IT LOOKS LIKE A TINY LITTLE PERSON

111
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,784
DROWNING IN YOUR CEREAL.

112
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,789
GOD, WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

113
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,791
YOU NEED TO GET SOME SLEEP.

114
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,293
I NEED TO GET SOME RICHARD.

115
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,798
MONICA, YOU BROKE UP WITH HIM FOR A REASON.

116
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,300
I KNOW. I KNOW.

117
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,302
I'M JUST SO TIRED OF MISSING HIM.

118
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,804
I'M TIRED OF WONDERING WHY HE HASN'T CALLED.

119
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,306
WHY HASN'T HE CALLED?

120
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,808
MAYBE BECAUSE YOU TOLD HIM NOT TO?

121
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,312
WHAT ARE YOU? THE MEMORY WOMAN?

122
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,814
THEY'RE NOT BREAKING UP.

123
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,816
CHANDLER AND JANICE-- THEY'RE NOT BREAKING UP.

124
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,318
HE DIDN'T BLINK OR ANYTHING.

125
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,320
WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURPRISED.

126
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,322
I MEAN, HAVE YOU SEEN THEM TOGETHER?

127
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,823
THEY'RE REALLY CUTE.

128
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,824
CUTE?

129
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,825
THIS IS JANICE.

130
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,827
YOU REMEMBER JANICE?

131
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,329

132
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,331
SHE'S ANNOYING, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

133
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,832
SHE'S HIS GIRLFRIEND NOW.

134
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,833
I MEAN, WHAT CAN WE DO?

135
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,335
THERE YOU GO.

136
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,836
THAT'S THE SPIRIT I'M LOOKING FOR.

137
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,837
WHAT CAN WE DO?

138
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,839
HUH?

139
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,840

00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,342
HUH? ROSS?

141
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,843

SO I SAY WE ALL JUST BE ADULT ABOUT IT AND ACCEPT HER.

144
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,350

145
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,854
COME ON, PEOPLE, WE NEED SOME INSPIRATION.

00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,855

AND DISABLE THE ALARM, OKAY?

151
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,364
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, THE REST OF US WILL JUST RAPPEL DOWN ROPES--

152
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,866
WE'RE IN AND OUT IN TEN MINUTES AND DISAPPEAR INTO THE NIGHT.

153
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,368
HUH? HUH?

154
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,893

DO YOU STILL HAVE THAT, UM, NAVY UNIFORM?

157
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,902
NO. I HAD TO RETURN IT TO THE COSTUME PLACE.

158
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,903
I THINK I HAVE

159
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,906
AN OLD BAND UNIFORM FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

160
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,910
YOU REMEMBER NOT HAVING SE X IN HIGH SCHOOL, RIGHT?

161
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,911
YEAH.

162
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,417

00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,427
NO.

00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,930
COME ON. YOU GOT TO HAVE ONE.

167
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,932
NOPE.

168
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,934

170
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,938
IF YOU TELL ME , I MIGHT DO IT.

171
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,446

172
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,947
OKAY.

00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,979
MEN AND WOMEN REALLY ARE DIFFERENT.

181
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:04,984
NO, NO. NO, SEE, JABBA HAD AS HIS PRISONER

182
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,487

SO, ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO, UM...

188
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,011

197
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,532
AND SHE BECAME LIKE A WOMAN, YOU KNOW?

198
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:57,036
DID YOU EVER...? DO THE...? THE LEIA THING?

199
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,038
OH, YEAH. MM HMM.

200
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,542
OOH!

00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,545

203
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,548
NO. IT'S JUST THAT I GOT THIS NEW PAGER

204
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,550
AND I HAVE IT ON VIBRATE.

205
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,555
SEE YOU.

206
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,556
HEY...

00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,057
HI, YOU GUYS.

00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,058
LOOK WHO I FOUND

209
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,561
STANDING OUTSIDE THE SZECHUAN DRAGON

210
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,563
STARING AT A PARKING METER.

211
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:24,564

212
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:25,565

HI.

00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,569
WHY AREN'T YOU AT WORK?

216
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,571
OH, THEY... THEY SENT ME HOME.

217
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,072
WHY?

218
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,074
BECAUSE I DON'T WORK AT THE SZECHUAN DRAGON.

219
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,075
OKAY.

220
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,078
YOU REALLY, REALLY NEED TO GET SOME SLEEP.

221
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,079
I KNOW I DO.

222
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,080
HI. HI.

223
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,081

224
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,583
THEY PUBLISH ED MY PAPER.

225
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,084
REALLY?

226
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,085
YEAH. STATISTICAL DEVIATIONS

227
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,087
IN THE CARBON DATING OF FOSSILIZED ALGAE

228
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,590
COLONHISTORY OR MYSTERY?

229
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,094
RACH, LOOK.

230
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,095
NO.

231
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,097
OOH, HI.

232
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,603
WHERE IS MY STRONG ROSS SKYWALKER

233
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,605
TO COME RESCUE ME?

234
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,110
THERE HE IS.

235
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,615

236
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,617
WHEEL OF

237
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,118
Fortune...

238
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,121
Is there a T? THIS GUY'S SO STUPID.

239
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,123
IT'S COUNT RUSHMORE.

240
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,129
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD REALLY GO ON THIS SHOW.

241
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,130
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.

242
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,133
I GOT THREE TICKETS TO THE RANGERS TONIGHT.

243
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,635
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

244
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,136
I SAY I AM THERE.

245
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,640
COOL. OH... IS ROSS GOING TOO?

246
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,141
NO. JANICE.

247
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,643
JANICE?

248
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,648
BECAUSE I JUST... I FEEL BAD FOR ROSS, YOU KNOW?

249
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,150
I MEAN, WE ALWAYS GO TOGETHER.

250
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,653
WE'RE LIKE THE THREE HOCK A TEERS.

251
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,155
YOU KNOW, I MAY BE WAY OUT ON A LIMB HERE

252
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,658
BUT DO YOU... DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH JANICE?

253
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,159
NO.

254
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,161
YES.

255
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,664
GOD, HOW DO I SAY THIS?

256
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,667
HI. UH, OH...

257
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,670
YOU KNOW THAT GIRL FROM THE GREEK RESTAURANT

258
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,671
WITH THE HAIR?

259
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,673
EWW, THAT GIRL THAT I HATE?

260
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,675
EWW, SHE DRIVES ME CRAZY.

261
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,676
EWW, OH.

262
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,178
LOOK, I DON'T HATE JANICE.

263
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,180
SHE'S JUST A LOT TO TAKE, YOU KNOW?

264
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,684
WELL, THERE YOU GO.

265
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,185
OH, HEY, COME ON, MAN.

266
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,187
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

267
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,690
SHE USED TO DRIVE YOU NUTS BEFORE TOO, REMEMBER?

268
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,692
YEAH, WELL, I'M CRAZY ABOUT HER NOW.

269
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,694
I THINK THIS COULD BE THE REAL THING.

270
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,195
CAPITAL "R," CAPITAL "T."

271
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,197
DON'T WORRY.

272
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,199
THOSE ARE THE RIGHT LETTERS.

273
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:45,204
LOOK... WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

274
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,707
I WANT YOU TO SAY THAT YOU LIKE HER.

275
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,208
I CAN'T. LIKE HER!

276
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,710
NO.

277
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,712
SO YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO TRY?

278
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,213
WHAT'S THE POINT?

279
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,215
IT'S LIKE THIS CHEMICAL THING, YOU KNOW?

280
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,217
EVERY TIME SHE STARTS LAUGHING

281
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,719
I JUST WANT TO...

282
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,722
PULL MY ARM OFF

283
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,224
JUST SO I HAVE SOMETHING TO THROW AT HER.

284
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,728
THANKS FOR TRYING.

285
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:14,233
OH, AND BY THE WAY, THERE IS NO COUNT RUSHMORE.

286
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,737
YEAH? THEN WHO'S THE GUY THAT PAINTED THE FACES

287
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,238
ON THE MOUNTAIN?

288
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,747
HOW COULD YOU HAVE TOLD HER?

289
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,249
ROSS, I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE THAT BIG A DEAL.

290
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,251
OH, SHE DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE THAT BIG A DEAL.

291
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,754
OKAY, WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO WHEN YOU DO THAT?

292
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,256
LOOK, THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

293
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,259
LIKE A PRIVATE, PERSONAL THING BETWEEN US.

294
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,261
OKAY, ROSS, PHOEBE  IS MY GIRLFRIEND, OKAY?

295
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,764
WE TELL EACH OTHER EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW?

296
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,765
I MEAN, COME ON.

297
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,266
GUYS DO THE SAME THING.

298
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,269
WHAT ABOUT ALL THAT LOCKER ROOM STUFF?

299
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,771
THAT'S DIFFERENT, OKAY?

300
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,272
THAT'S LIKE WHO DATED A STRIPPER

301
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,776
OR WHO DID IT ON THE BACK OF THE STATEN ISLAND FERRY?

302
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,277
BOTH OF THOSE JOEY?

303
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,779
YEAH.

304
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,781
BUT YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT

305
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,783
LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOUR GIRLFRIEND

306
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,786
AND THE INTIMATE STUFF YOU DO WITH HER.

307
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,788
NOT EVEN WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND?

308
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,789
NO.

309
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:10,790
THAT IS SO SAD.

310
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,792
YOU'RE MISSING OUT

311
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,293
ON SO MUCH, ROSS.

312
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,296
I MEAN, THE BONDING AND THE SHARING, YOU KNOW

313
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,798
AND KNOWING THAT SOMEONE ELSE

314
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,801
IS GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING YOU ARE.

315
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:26,305
SO... WHAT... YOU TELL EACH OTHER EVERYTHING?

316
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,307
YEAH... PRETTY MUCH.

317
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,814
DID YOU TALK ABOUT "THE NIGHT OF FIVE TIMES?"

318
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,820
DO YOU TELL PEOPLE ABOUT "THE NIGHT OF FIVE TIMES?"

319
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,322
UH, HONEY... YEAH, THAT WAS WITH CAROL.

320
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,825
I KNOW, BUT IT'S STILL WORTH MENTIONING, I THINK.

321
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:53,332
RELAX EVERY MUSCLE IN YOUR BODY.

322
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,837
LISTEN TO THE PLINKY PLUNKY MUSIC.

323
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,840
OKAY, NOW CLOSE YOUR EYES

324
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,844
AND THINK OF A HAPPY PLACE.

325
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,846
OKAY, TELL ME YOUR HAPPY PLACE.

326
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,348
RICHARD'S LIVING ROOM, DRINKING WINE.

327
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,349
ALL RIGHT, NO, NO.

328
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,851
NOT A RICHARD THING.

329
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,854
JUST PUT DOWN THE GLASS... AND GET OUT!

330
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,857
I'M SORRY, BUT THAT'S MY HAPPY PLACE.

331
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,859
WELL, OKAY, FINE, USE MY HAPPY PLACE, OKAY?

332
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,360
I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE TO ASK

333
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,862
THAT YOU DON'T MOVE ANYTHING IN THERE.

334
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,865
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TRY NOT TO.

335
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,368
ALL RIGHT, SO, YOU'RE IN A MEADOW

336
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,872
MILLIONS OF STARS IN THE SKY...

337
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,874
DO YOU THINK BREAKING UP WITH HIM WAS A HUGE MISTAKE?

338
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,376
OKAY, THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS IN THE HAPPY PLACE.

339
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,378
OKAY, JUST

340
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,880
THE WARM BREEZE

341
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,884
AND THE MOONLIGHT FLOWING THROUGH THE TREE...

342
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,385
I'LL BET HE'S TOTALLY OVER ME.

343
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,887
I'LL BET HE'S FINE.

344
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,388
ALL RIGHT, BETTING AND WAGERING OF ANY KIND

345
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,390
ARE, I'M SURE, NOT PERMITTED IN THE HAPPY PLACE.

346
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,393
OKAY? THERE'S JUST, YOU KNOW

347
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,395
THE THE LOVELY WATERFALLS

348
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,397
AND THE, THE TRICKLING FOUNTAINS

349
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:04,904
AND THE CALMING SOUNDS OF THE BABBLING BROOK...

350
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,405
OKAY, THIS ISN'T WORKING.

351
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,908
I'M STILL AWAKE AND NOW I HAVE TO PEE.

352
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,409
OH.

353
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,411

354
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,412
 GUESS WHO.

355
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,915

356
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,917

357
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,923
JANICE.

358
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,924

359
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,425
HI. YOU JUST MISSED CHANDLER

360
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,928
BUT, UH, WON'T YOU COME IN BEFORE YOU GO?

361
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,932
SO...

362
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,434
I HEAR... YOU HATE ME.

363
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,436
HEY, I NEVER SAID "HATE."

364
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:41,440
I WAS VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THAT.

365
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,441
A LITTLE BIRDIE TOLD ME

366
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,444
SOMETHING ABOUT YOU WANTING TO RIP YOUR ARM OFF

367
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,946
AND THROW IT AT ME.

368
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,949
AND YOU GOT A "HATE" FROM THAT?

369
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,951
YOU'RE TAKING A BIG LEAP THERE.

370
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,453
ALL RIGHT. FINE, FINE, FINE, FINE, FINE.

371
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,455
WE HAVE GOT TO DO SOMETHING

372
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,958
ABOUT OUR LITTLE SITUATION HERE, JOEY.

373
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,459
SO, THIS IS MY IDEA.

374
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,463
YOU AND ME SPENDING SOME QUALITY TIME TOGETHER.

375
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,966
BUT WHAT DOES THAT...?

376
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,467
FOR CHANDLER!

377
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,470
OKAY. I'M IN.

378
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,473
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO CALL IT.

379
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,475
"JOEY AND JANICE'S DAY OF FUN."

380
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,479
DOES IT HAVE TO BE A WHOLE DAY?

381
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,483
YES! BECAUSE THAT'S HOW LONG IT TAKES TO LOVE ME.

382
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,985
YEAH. I KNOW.

383
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,987
I SLEEP IN THE NEXT ROOM.

384
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,996
SO, DO YOU GUYS ALL HATE JANICE, TOO?

385
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,497
OH, YOU HATE JANICE NOW?

386
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,000
OH! JOEY'S GOING TO BE SO RELIEVED.

387
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,004
OH, MY GOD.

388
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,006

389
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,508
OH, GOD...

390
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:54,013
OH, LOOK, EVERYBODY, IT'S WEEPY...

391
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,016
THE MIME THAT CARES TOO MUCH.

392
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,518
AND THEN I WENT DOWN TO THE POST OFFICE.

393
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,521
IT TURNS OUT IT WAS THOSE VIDEOS THAT I ORDERED FOR RICHARD

394
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,523
ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR.

395
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,027
HE LOVED THE CIVIL WAR.

396
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:13,032
MONICA, DO YOU WANT  US TO TAKE YOU HOME?

397
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,533
UH HUH.

398
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,038
OR MAYBE TO A GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY.

399
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,548
WOMEN TELL EACH OTHER EVERYTHING.

400
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,549
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

401
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,052
HMM, YEAH.

402
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,554
NO, CHANDLER, EVERYTHING... LIKE...

403
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,056
STUFF YOU LIKE.

404
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,058
STUFF SHE LIKES.

405
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:43,062
TECHNIQUE, STAMINA, GIRTH.

406
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,065
GIRTH?

407
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,566
WHY, WHY, WHY, WHY

408
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,569
WHY, WHY WOULD THEY DO THIS?

409
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,572
RACHEL SAYS SHARING'S GREAT

410
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,074
AND SUPPOSEDLY , YOU KNOW

411
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,575
WE OUGHT TO BE DOING IT.

412
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,579
UH, DO YOU WANT TO?

413
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,083
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT GIRTH, ARE WE?

414
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,084
NO!

415
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,586
YEAH, OKAY.

416
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,587
YEAH?

417
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,089
ALL RIGHT, YOU GO FIRST.

418
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,591
OKAY, OKAY. I'LL GO FIRST.

419
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,094
SO, UH, THE OTHER NIGHT

420
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,598
RACHEL AND I ARE IN BED TALKING ABOUT FANTASIES.

421
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:23,102
AND I HAPPENED TO DESCRIBE A PARTICULAR...

422
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,104
STAR WARS THING.

423
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,605
PRINCESS LEIA AND THE GOLD BIKINI.

424
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,107
YES!

425
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,608
I KNOW.

426
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,609
YES.

427
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,111
WELL, WOW...

428
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,613
WELL, THAT WAS EASY.

429
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,614
GO. OKAY, YOU

430
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,116
OKAY. OKAY.

431
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,117
OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW

432
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,619
WHEN YOU'RE IN BED WITH A WOMAN...

433
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,620
HMM.

434
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,621
AND YOU KNOW

435
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,623
YOU'RE FOOLING AROUND WITH HER

436
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,125
AND YOU GET

437
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,627
ALL THESE, LIKE, MENTAL IMAGES IN YOUR BRAIN.

438
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,129
YOU KNOW LIKE, ELLE MacPHERSON

439
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,630
OR THAT GIRL AT THE XEROX PLACE.

440
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,632
WITH THE BELLY BUTTON RING?

441
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,633
OH...MM WAH.

442
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,135
AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN

443
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,137
YOUR MOM POPS IN YOUR HEAD.

444
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,139
AND YOU'RE LIKE

445
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,640
"MOM, GET OUT OF HERE."

446
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,142
BUT, OF COURSE, AFTER THAT

447
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,145
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE

448
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,648
AND YOU CAN'T, YOU KNOW, STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING

449
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,651
SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE YOU'RE... YOU KNOW...

450
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,655
YOU DON'T KNOW.

451
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,656
YOUR... MOM?

452
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,160
YOU'RE, YOU'RE TELLING  ME ABOUT YOUR MOM?

453
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,162
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

454
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,164
YOU SAID...

455
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,166
I SAID, "SHARE," NOT "SCARE."

456
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,168
GO SIT OVER THERE.

457
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,674
WE'RE BACK!

458
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,676
HEY!

459
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,179
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING TOGETHER?

460
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,682
"JOEY AND JANICE'S DAY OF FUN."

461
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,685
REALLY?

462
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,686
 YEAH, YEAH.

463
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,188
WE WENT TO A METS GAME.

464
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,689
WE GOT CHINESE FOOD

465
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,192
AND, YOU KNOW, I LOVE THIS WOMAN.

466
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,695
YOU HAVE GOT COMPETITION, BUDDY.

467
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:01,700
I JUST CAME BY TO GIVE YOU A KISS.

468
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,202

469
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,704
I HAVE TO GO PICK UP THE BABIES

470
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,207
SO I'LL SEE YOU LATER, SWEETHEART.

471
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,708
YOU TOO, CHANDLER.

472
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,709

473
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,219
YOU STILL CAN'T STAND HER, CAN YOU?

474
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,220
I'M SORRY, MAN.

475
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,222
I TRIED. I REALLY DID.

476
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,726
WELL, YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE YOU GIVING IT A SHOT.

477
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,229
BUT, HEY, LOOK, YOU KNOW, THE GOOD THING IS

478
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,731
IS THAT WE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY TOGETHER

479
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,233
AND I SURVIVED.

480
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,735
AND WHAT'S EVEN MORE AMAZING, SO DID SHE.

481
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,238
I MEAN, IT WAS "BAT DAY" AT SHEA STADIUM.

482
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,739
YEAH, I...

483
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,741
I GUESS THAT'S SOMETHING.

484
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,742
OH, MAN.

485
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,743
THAT'S HUGE.

486
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,246
NOW I KNOW I CAN STAND TO BE AROUND HER

487
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,749
WHICH MEANS, I GET TO HANG OUT WITH YOU

488
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,252
WHICH IS KIND OF THE WHOLE POINT ANYWAY.

489
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,254
OKAY.

490
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,757
OH, HEY, CHANDLER

491
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,759
WE STOPPED BY THE COFFEE SHOP

492
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,761
AND RAN INTO ROSS.

493
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,268
OH, GOD.

494
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,271
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER

495
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,773
I DO IT TOO.

496
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,774
REALLY?

497
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,276
OH, YEAH.

498
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,778
I ALWAYS PICTURE YOUR  MOM WHEN I'M HAVING SEX.

499
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,286
April 12, 1861...

500
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,793
... United States garrison ]at Fort Sumter was fired upon.

501
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,794

502
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,296
It is now under bombardment...

503
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,302

504
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,807
HEY, DAD.

505
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,309
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

506
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,810
WELL, IT'S YOUR MOTHER'S BRIDGE NIGHT

507
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,812
SO I THOUGHT I'D COME INTO THE CITY

508
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,314
FOR A LITTLE MONI CUDDLE.

509
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,320
SINCE WHEN DID YOU START SMOKING CIGARS?

510
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,821
I DON'T.

511
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,822
I JUST...

512
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,325
I JUST LIKE THE SMELL OF THEM.

513
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,826
SO, UH...

514
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,829
WHAT ARE YOU REALLY DOING HERE, DAD?

515
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,331
WELL, I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE

516
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,832
THAT YOU'RE OKAY.

517
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,834
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT I MIGHT NOT BE OKAY?

518
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,336
I SAW RICHARD.

519
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,339
OH?

520
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,341
SO, HOW YOU DOING?

521
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,342
FINE.

522
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,843
JUST A LITTLE TIRED.

523
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,346
I'M OKAY.

524
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,847
HOW'S RICHARD DOING?

525
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,349
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

526
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,352
NO, I REALLY, REALLY DO.

527
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,854
WELL, HE'S DOING TERRIBLE.

528
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,858
REALLY?

529
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,361
WORSE THAN WHEN HE BROKE UP WITH BARBARA.

530
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,364
YOU'RE NOT JUST SAYING THAT, ARE YOU?

531
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,867
NO, THE MAN IS A MESS.

532
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,369
WAS HE CRYING?

533
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,870
NO.

534
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,871
WELL, DO YOU THINK

535
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,873
HE WAS WAITING UNTIL AFTER YOU LEFT

536
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,874
SO HE COULD CRY?

537
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,877
MAYBE.

538
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,879
I THINK SO.

539
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,881
HONEY, RELATIONSHIPS ARE HARD.

540
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,383
LIKE WITH YOUR MOM AND ME.

541
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,387
AFTER WE GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE, WE BROKE UP FOR A WHILE.

542
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,389
IT SEEMS HER FATHER, YOUR GRANDFATHER

543
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,392
WANTED HER TO TRAVEL AROUND EUROPE LIKE HE DID.

544
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,895
OF COURSE, HE GOT TO DO IT ON UNCLE SAM'S NICKEL

545
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:20,899
BECAUSE HE WAS ALSO STRAFING GERMAN TROOP TRAINS AT THE TIME.

546
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,401
HOWEVER...

547
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:54,433

548
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,442

549
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,444
OKAY, HERE WE  GO.

550
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,945
I'M JABBA'S PRISONER

551
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,947
AND YOU

552
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,450
HAVE A REALLY WEIRD LOOK ON YOUR FACE.

553
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,951
WHAT? WHAT IS  IT?

554
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,453
DID I GET IT WRONG?

555
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,954
DID I GET THE HAIR WRONG?

556
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,456
DID YOU JUST PICTURE IT DIFFERENTLY?

557
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,457
COME ON, WHAT?

558
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,459
NO, NO. IT'S NOT YOU.

559
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,960
IT'S, UM, IT'S...

560
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,966
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

561
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,969
COME ON, SWEETIE, YOU'RE KIND OF, LIKE, FREAKING ME OUT HERE.

562
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,473
I HATE CHANDLER.
