1166
00:46:26,718 --> 00:46:29,220

1167
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:36,794
PHOEBE, ARE YOU STILL ON HOLD?

1168
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,796
I WAS SUPPOSED TO CALL MY DAD BACK

1169
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:39,797
LIKE, TWO HOURS AGO.

1170
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:40,798
OH, YEAH, HE CLICKED ON.

1171
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:42,800
HE SAID CALL HIM AS SOON AS YOU GET A CHANCE.

1172
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,302
HE'S AT FLIMBY'S.

1173
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,803
WHAT'S FLIMBY'S?

1174
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,805

THE REAL THING.

1177
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:51,809
OKAY, HANG UP.

1178
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,311
THAT'S IT. COME ON.

1179
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,313
NO, RACHEL, THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT ME TO DO.

1180
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:56,814
MY WARRANTY EXPIRES TOMORROW.

1181
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,317
IF I DON'T GET THROUGH, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FIX

1182
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,319
MY CRAPPY, BROKEN PHONE FOR FREE.

1201
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:35,853
WHOSE NUMBER TWO?

1202
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,856
ONE OF THE MORE DIFFICULT GAMES SEWER WORKERS PLAY.

1203
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,860
NO, IT'S JUST THIS PERSON.

1204
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,862
LIKE A DATE TYPE OF PERSON?

1205
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,364

1206
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:47,865
IT'S THIS WOMAN FROM WORK.

1207
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,367
I HOPE THAT WON'T BE TOO WEIRD.

1208
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,868

1209
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:51,869

00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,371
NO, NOT AT ALL.

1211
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,373
I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO BRING SOMEONE MYSELF.

1212
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:58,376
BUT YOU SAID ONE TICKET.

1213
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,381

00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,400
I BORROWED SOME OF YOUR COLOGNE.

1223
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,401
I HOPE SHE LIKES IT.

1224
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:24,902
JOEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1225
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,404
THIS IS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.

1226
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:27,405
SHE'S SEEING SOMEBODY.

1227
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:28,906
YEAH, AND I DON'T HAVE ANY COLOGNE.

1228
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,409

1229
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,411

1244
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,463

00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:26,964
THANKS. OKAY.

1246
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,968

00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:37,475
I'M STILL HERE.

1250
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:40,478
DON'T SWITCH OR ANYTHING, BECAUSE I'M RIGHT HERE.

00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,501
YOU GOT TO HANG UP, BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE.

1264
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,003
Thank you for your patience.

1265
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,004

1268
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,012

OF COURSE NOT. NO.

1271
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:23,521
OKAY. I JUST WANTED THEM TO HEAR IT FROM SOMEBODY ELSE.

00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:00,558

1288
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,560
OKAY.

1289
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,062
I THINK I'M GOING TO RUN TO THE LADIES' ROOM.

1290
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,564

00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,078

1312
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,111
IDIOT!

00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,113

SO, SO, WHAT DID YOU THINK?

1327
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:37,154
ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE PLAY WITH THE TWO NAKED GIRLS

1328
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,155
ON THE SEESAW.

1329
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,657

1343
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,187

00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,715
I PURSUED HER FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS

00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,718
AND SHE WAS MINE.

1359
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,221
YEAH, AND IN THE LONG VERSION

1360
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,224
I DUMP HIM FOR TELLING PEOPLE THE SHORT VERSION.

1361
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,727
JOEY, SWEETHEART, YOU WERE FABULOUS.

1362
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,731
HEY, YOU GUYS, THIS IS MY AGENT, ESTELLE.

1363
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,232
HOW DO YOU DO?

1364
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,734
OH, YOU TWO GIRLS

1365
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,736
WERE OUTSTANDING.

1366
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,738
DO THEY HAVE REPRESENTATION?

1367
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,741
NO, THEY WEREN'T IN THE PLAY.

1368
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,242
WE'RE NOT ACTORS.

1369
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,744
OH, WHAT A SHAME.

1370
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:08,746
BECAUSE WITH HER FACE AND HER CHEST

1371
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:11,248
I COULD REALLY PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER.

1372
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,252
COULD I BORROW IT?

1373
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,755
HI.

1374
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:19,256

00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:25,763
I THINK HE'S GOING TO SNAP.

1379
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:28,766
ROSS, I'M GOING TO GO.

1380
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:29,767
GO? WHY?

1381
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,268
I DON'T KNOW.

1382
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:35,272
COULD BE BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL LIKE STANDING AROUND ALL NIGHT

1383
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,774
WAITING FOR SOME GUY

1384
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:38,776

00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:41,779
BUT, CAILIN, HE DEFINITELY WILL SCREAM.

1386
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,280

YOUR PLAY IS THE NEXT PLAY I'M GOING TO SEE.

01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:45,642
ANYWAY, HOW DID IT GO WITH KATE?

1509
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,144
AW, IT WAS GREAT. YEAH.

1510
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:48,645
I WALKED HER HOME

1511
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,648

1512
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,151

JOEY, YOU HAD THE NIGHT.

1517
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:03,160
WHAT?

1518
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,162
WHEN TWO PEOPLE FINALLY REALIZE

1519
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:08,165
THEIR FEELINGS FOR EACH OTHER AND THEY TALK FOR HOURS

1520
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:10,167
AND THEY LEARN ALL ABOUT THE OTHER PERSON.

1521
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:12,169
YOU... YOU THINK?

1522
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,171
DID YOU, LIKE, LEARN ABOUT HER FAMILY?

1523
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:15,672
TWO BROTHERS, ONE DIED.

1524
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:16,673
YES!

1525
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,674
OH!

1526
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,182
THIS IS FROM THE WOMAN AT THE BAR.

1527
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:26,683
OH, HO, HO, HO.

1528
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:32,189
SORRY. SHE THOUGHT YOU WERE SOMEBODY ELSE.

1529
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,694
WHAT TIME IS IT?

1530
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,196
1:00.
1:00.

1531
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:40,197
7:15.

1532
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,699
WATCH DOESN'T WORK.

1533
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,701
TOMMY'S SUPPOSED TO BE HERE SOON.

1534
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,203
WE'RE GOING TO LUNCH.

1535
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:52,709
LOOK... LOOK, I WASN'T GOING TO SAY ANYTHING TO YOU

1536
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,710
BUT... ALL RIGHT.

1537
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,713
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE SEEING TOMMY ANYMORE.

1538
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,715
YOU DON'T?

1539
01:01:58,715 --> 01:01:59,716
NO.

1540
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,219
THE GUY IS MEAN-- I MEAN, REALLY MEAN.

1541
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:04,221
I THINK YOU SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM HIM.

1542
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:08,725
HMM, OR MAYBE... I SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM ALL MEN.

1543
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,728
NO. IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE I'M JEALOUS.

1544
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,231
I MEAN, I'M NOT.

1545
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:15,232
I'M NOT JEALOUS.

1546
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:18,235
OKAY, IT'S... LOOK, THE GUY-- HE SCREAMED.

1547
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:20,737
HE ACTUALLY SCREAMED AT THIS COUPLE SITTING IN OUR SEATS.

1548
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,240
YEAH. AND AT THE END OF THE PLAY, HE...

1549
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:26,243
HE GOT UP, YOU KNOW, AND HE JUST STARTED, LIKE...

1550
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,745
BANGING HIS HANDS TOGETHER.

1551
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:31,748
OKAY, FINE, FINE.

1552
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:32,749
YOU DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE ME?

1553
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,751
NO, THAT'S FINE.

1554
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,253
WE'RE KIDDING.

1555
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:37,254
ROSS?

1556
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:38,755
FINE, NO ONE BELIEVES ME.

1557
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,257
I'M MR. FUNNY TO YOU.

1558
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,258
MR. FUNNY... WHOA!

1559
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:42,259
SORRY, TOM.

1560
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:44,261
WHAT'S IN THE CUP, ROSS?

1561
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:45,762
UM...

01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,265
WHAT IS IN THE CUP?

1563
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:49,766
OKAY, IT'S COFFEE.

1564
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:50,767
ICED COFFEE?

1565
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,768
TELL ME IT'S ICED COFFEE.

1566
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:54,771

HOT COFFEE!

1568
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:57,274

YOU'RE GOING TO SPILL HOT COFFEE ALL OVER ME?!

1570
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:00,777

WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE THING ABOUT SUMMER TIME?

1575
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,790
GOING TO THE BEACH

1576
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,792
WHEN IT STAYS LIGHT REAL LATE.

1577
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,794

1578
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:18,795

OOH, I DON'T KNOW.

1583
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,304
PROBABLY THE SMELL OF FRESHLY CUT GRASS.

1584
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,806
AW, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

1585
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,309

1586
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,310
HEY, SORRY.

1587
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,812
SORRY I'M LATE. SORRY I'M LATE.

1588
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,314
MY DUCK AND MY CHICK HAD A FIGHT.

1589
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:38,315
IT WAS UGLY.

1590
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:41,318
LOOK, WE HELD THE CURTAIN FOR YOU, BUDDY. LET'S GO.

1591
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:43,320

01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:49,826

01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,335

1596
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:01,838
I'VE BEEN WAITING UP

1597
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:02,839

1598
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,341

1599
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:07,844

I WANT TO RUN DOWN TO THE TRUCK

1603
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:13,850

01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,355
WHAT DO YOU GOT DOWN THERE, VIC?

1605
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:20,357
WHAT DO YOU GOT UNDER THAT TARP?

1606
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,362
WHEN IS SHE LEAVING?

1607
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:26,363
TONIGHT.

1608
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:28,365
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1609
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:31,368

1618
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,890
I WILL KILL YOU.

1619
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,892
HEY, DO YOU MIND IF I USE THE PHONE?

1620
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:56,893
OH, I...

1621
01:04:56,893 --> 01:05:00,897
BUT I... AND I HAVE TO WAIT...

1622
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,900
WHY DON'T YOU USE OURS ACROSS THE HALL

1623
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,902
BECAUSE SHE... HAS PROBLEMS.

01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,422
ROSS, WOULD YOU JUST STOP IT?

1631
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:26,923
IT'S GETTING REALLY OLD.

1632
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,925
I CAN'T BELIEVE NO ONE BELIEVES ME.

1633
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,927
I DO. I BELIEVE YOU.

1634
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,429

01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,498
I COULDN'T FIND YOU BEFORE.

1664
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:44,000
WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT L.A.?

1665
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,002
THEY STILL WANT ME FOR GENERAL HOSPITAL.

01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:49,005
BUT... WELL, WHAT ABOUT US?

1667
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:52,509
LAST NIGHT WAS WONDERFUL

1668
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:55,512

01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:08,024

1678
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:13,530

1686
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:40,056
AND I GOT TO SAY IT QUICK, BECAUSE THIS IS KILLING ME.

1687
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:43,560
ONE THING YOU GOT TO KNOW IS THAT...

1688
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,562
I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU

1689
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,564

01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:50,066

1693
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:09,586
IN SEARCH OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS

1694
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:11,588
BUT WHEN I RETURN

1695
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:16,092
200 YEARS FROM NOW, YOU'LL BE LONG GONE.

1696
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:20,597
BUT I WON'T HAVE AGED AT ALL.

1697
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:26,603
SO YOU TELL YOUR GREAT- GREAT GRAND DAUGHTER

1698
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:28,605

PHOEBE, 800 IS TOLL FREE.

01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:07,644
801 IS UTAH.

1707
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:12,649
NO, NO, NO. IT HAS TO BE 800.

1708
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:16,653
BECAUSE ALL THOSE BIG COMPANIES HAVE 800 NUMBERS. EVERY...
