1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:03,503
OKAY, HEY.

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,505
UM, DOES EVERYBODY HATE THESE SHOES?

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,506
 OH, YEAH

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,008
BUT DON'T WORRY-- I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,510
GOING TO FOCUS ON THAT AS LONG AS YOU'RE WEARING

6
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,012
THAT TOWEL DRESS.

7
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,513
TELL HIM.

8
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,515
IT'S HER FIRST DAY AT THIS NEW JOB.

9
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,517
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO START WITH HER.

10
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,019
ALL RIGHT.

11
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,021
I SUPPOSE I CAN WAIT A DAY.

12
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,023
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING FRIDAY?

13
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,024
WHY?

14
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,026
I NEED YOU TO COME TO THIS BACHELOR PARTY

15
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,527

16
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,029

00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,530
OH, GOD.

18
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,033
YEAH, BOTANISTS ARE SUCH GEEKS.

19
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,534
YEAH.

20
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,036
THAT A DINOSAUR TIE?

21
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,537
HMM? OH, YEAH.

22
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,539

23
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,541

24
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,043
GOOD MORNING.

25
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,545
RACH, I'M HERE WITH THE PURSES.

26
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,050

THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, PHEEBS.

28
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,553
OH, YOU'RE WELCOME. OH, PLEASE WANT

29
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,055
THE ONE WITH THE TURTLES.

30
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,056
NO, NO, NO, NO. TURTLES SCARE ME.

31
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,557
I DON'T NEED THAT TODAY.

32
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,059
HONEY, JUST RELAX.

33
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,560
IT'S GOING TO BE FINE.

34
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,562
HEY, UM, WHY DON'T I COME DOWN THERE

35
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,564
AND I'LL TAKE YOU OUT TO LUNCH?

36
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,567
OH, HONEY, THANK YOU, BUT MARK'S TAKING ME OUT.

37
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,069
MARK?

38
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,072
IS THAT THE SAME MARK THAT HELPED YOU GET THE JOB?

39
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,073
YEAH. IT'S KIND OF LIKE

40
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,075
A GOOD LUCK ON YOUR- FIRST DAY SORT OF THING.

41
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,576
IS THIS ACTUALLY A LUNCH BOX?

42
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,078
UM, NO. IT'S A PURSE

43
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,080
AND THERE'S A THERMOS IN IT.

44
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,082
OH!

45
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,084
HEY, SO, CAN YOU MAKE IT ON FRIDAY?

46
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,085
WHAT?

47
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,586
OH, YEAH, YEAH, I THINK SO.

48
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,088
WHY AM I INVITED TO THIS AGAIN?

49
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,589
YEAH, APPARENTLY, ALBERT HAS NO FRIENDS.

50
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,092
HE'S VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE BACHELOR PARTY, THOUGH.

51
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,594
I THINK ACTUALLY THE ONLY REASON HE'S GETTING MARRIED

52
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,596
IS SO HE CAN SEE A STRIPPER.

53
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,598
A STRIPPER AT A BACHELOR PARTY.

54
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,600
THAT IS SO CLICHE.

55
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,603
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS GET A MAGICIAN?

56
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,605
WELL, IF THE MAGICIAN CAN OPEN MY BEER

57
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,108
WITH HIS BUTT CHEEKS, THEN ALL RIGHT.

58
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:59,619
?  ?

59
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,621
?  ?

60
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,124
?  ?

61
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:09,129
?  ?

62
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,631
?  ?

63
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,634
?  ?

64
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:18,138
?  ?

65
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,140
?  ?

66
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,143
?  ?

67
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,145
?  ?

68
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,148
?  ?

69
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:34,654
?  ?

70
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,159
SHE'S HAVING LUNCH WITH HIM?

71
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,660
LUNCH WITH HIM?

72
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,662
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE HUG HE GAVE HER

73
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,164
WHEN SHE GOT THE JOB

74
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,166
AND AND AND HE'S REALLY GOOD LOOKING.

75
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,169
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

76
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,670
YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING.

77
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,671
KEEP IT INSIDE.

78
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,173
LEARN HOW TO HIDE YOUR FEELINGS

79
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,176
AND DON'T CRY OUT LOUD.

80
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,679
YES!

81
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,682
GUESS WHO HAS AN AUDITION FOR A BROADWAY MUSICAL?

82
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,683
I WANT TO SAY YOU

83
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,186
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE SUCH AN EASY ANSWER.

84
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,687
IT IS ME.

85
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,690
IT'S A MUSICAL VERSION OF A TALE OF TWO CITIES

86
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,693
SO I THINK I'M GOING TO SING "NEW YORK, NEW YORK"

87
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,195
AND, UH... OH!

88
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,197
"I LEFT MY HEART IN SAN FRANCISCO."

89
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,700
UH, JOEY

90
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,703
I DON'T THINK YOU GET TO PICK THE CITIES.

91
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,205
WHAT?

92
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,707
MR. DICKENS GETS TO PICK THEM.

93
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,709

94
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,713

95
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,714

00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,233

00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,739

OH! I LOVE THIS JOB.

109
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,244

OH, THAT'S THAT'S FUNNY.

130
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,280
WHY ISN'T HE GOOFING AROUND IN HIS OWN OFFICE?

131
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,282
HONEY, THIS IS HIS OFFICE, TOO.

132
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,784
I TOLD YOU-- WE'RE JOANNA'S TWO ASSISTANTS.

00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,787

00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,789

135
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,291
OH. OH, MY GOD!

00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,792
WHAT DID I JUST DO?

137
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,295
I THINK I JUST SHIPPED 3,000 BRAS TO PERSONNEL.

138
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,296
HONEY, I GOT TO GO.

139
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,297

00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,807
I WAS DIALING ANOTHER NUMBER.

145
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,321
ALL RIGHT

146
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,323
I JUST GOT CHANGED IN 30 SECONDS

147
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,824
SO YOU COULD BE ALONE WITH HIM.

148
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,326
YOU BETTER GO FOR IT.

149
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,328
PLEASE. I'M NOT GOING FOR ANYTHING.

150
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,330
WELL, IF YOU DON'T, I WILL.

151
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,332
WOULD YOU PLEASE GO?

152
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,833
NIGHT, MON.

153
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,335

154
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,836
NIGHT, JULIO.

155
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,837
ADIOS.

156
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,848
LOOK, JULIO.

157
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,350
SOMEONE LEFT THEIR BOOK HERE.

158
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,852
ACTUALLY, THAT IS MINE.

159
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,853
OH, YEAH?

160
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,355
YES.

161
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,856
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU READING?

162
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,858
FLOWERS OF EVIL BY BAUDELAIRE.

163
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,360
HAVE YOU READ IT?

164
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,361

165
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,862
HAVE I READ IT.

166
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,364
NO.

167
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,366
ARE YOU ENJOYING IT?

168
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,368
I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD

169
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,370
BUT THE TRANSLATION'S NO GOOD.

170
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,373
YOU'RE A POET AND YOU DON'T KNOW IT.

171
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,379
ACTUALLY, I, UH...

172
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,880
I AM A POET.

173
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,882
OH.

174
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,384
SO YOU DO KNOW IT.

175
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,885

176
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,390
SO, UH...

177
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,893
WHAT KIND OF THINGS DO YOU WRITE ABOUT?

178
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:34,894
THINGS THAT MOVE ME.

179
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,398
THE SHADOW OF A TREE.

180
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,900
A CHILD LAUGHING...

181
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,903
OR THIS LIP.

182
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,405
MINE?

183
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,407
RIGHT HERE?

184
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,409
YES.

185
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,411
I COULD WRITE AN EPIC POEM ABOUT...

186
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,413
THIS LIP.

187
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,921
HOW WOULD THAT GO?

188
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,434
WELL, IT DIDN'T RHYME

189
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,935
BUT I LIKED IT.

190
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,443

00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,444

JUST LOVELY.

195
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,959
REALLY? THANKS.

196
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,461
LISTEN, JOEY, WE DEFINITELY WANT TO SEE YOU

197
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,463
FOR THE CALLBACK ON SATURDAY.

198
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,964
EXCELLENT.

199
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,466
I'LL BE THERE.

200
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,467
OKAY

201
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,470
AND LISTEN, DON'T FORGET TO BRING YOUR JAZZ SHOES

202
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,472
FOR THE DANCE AUDITION.

203
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,977
MY, UH, MY AGENT SAID THAT IT WASN'T A DANCING PART.

204
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,480
OH, JOEY, ALL THE ROLES GOT TO DANCE A LITTLE

205
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,982
BUT BELIEVE ME, WITH YOUR DANCE BACKGROUND

206
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,484
IT'LL BE A PIECE OF CAKE.

207
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,488
"THREE YEARS OF MODERN DANCE WITH TWYLA THARP"?

208
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,991
FIVE YEARS WITH THE AMERICAN BALLET THEATER?

209
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,995
HEY, EVERYBODY LIES ON THEIR RESUME, OKAY?

210
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,999
I WASN'T ONE OF THE ZOOM KIDS EITHER.

211
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,002
WELL, CAN YOU, LIKE, DANCE AT ALL?

212
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,504
YEAH, I CAN DANCE.

213
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,005
YOU KNOW...

214
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,016
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO!

215
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,519
WHAT WHAT IS THAT?

216
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,020
SURE, IT LOOKS STUPID NOW.

217
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,522
THERE'S NO MUSIC PLAYING.

218
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,023

219
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,525
ALL RIGHT, I HAVE TO GET THAT

220
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,026
BUT NO, NO.

221
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,028
HELLO?

222
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,530
HI.

223
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,031

224
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,534
YEAH, UM, LISTEN, I'M IN NEED OF A STRIPPER

225
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,537
AND I WAS TOLD THAT YOU DO THAT.

226
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,039

227
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,541
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

228
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,043
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR THE EXTRA HUNDRED?

229
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,549
SO WOULD I... WOULD I HAVE TO PROVIDE THE GRAPES?

230
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,050
HI.

231
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,553
OOH! HOW WAS LAST NIGHT WITH JULIO, SENORITA?

232
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,555
HE IS SO AMAZING.

233
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,056
HE'S SO SEXY AND SMART

234
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,058
WHICH MAKES HIM EVEN SEXIER.

235
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,560
LOOK, I GOT TO TELL YOU THIS.

236
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,061
LAST NIGHT, WE WERE FOOLING AROUND

237
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,564
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE STOPS TO WRITE A POEM.

238
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,565
GET OUT.

239
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,568
I COULDN'T STOP IF A METEOR HIT ME.

240
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,071
OKAY, WE HAVE OUR STRIPPER--

241
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,575
A MISS CRYSTAL CHANDELIER.

242
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,076
WELL, SURE, YOU NAME A KID THAT

243
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,078
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT THEM TO GROW UP TO BE?

244
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,580
ANYWAY, WHEN HE LEFT

245
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,583
HE FORGOT TO TAKE THE POEM WITH HIM.

246
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,586
NOW, I AM TOTALLY DENSE ABOUT POETRY, BUT...

247
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,088
I THINK THIS IS PRETTY GOOD, ALL RIGHT?

248
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,590
CHECK IT OUT.

249
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,593
"THE EMPTY VASE.

250
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,595
TRANSLUCENT BEAUTY..."

251
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,597
TO YOURSELF.

252
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,600
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

253
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,101
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

254
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,102
OH, GOOD.

255
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,604
I THINK SO, TOO. PHEEB?

256
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,605
OH, YEAH.

257
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,106
I'M GLAD YOU GUYS LIKE IT. YAY.

258
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,608
I GOT TO GET TO WORK.

259
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,610
OH. I'M NOT DONE.

260
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,112
WELL, JUST GIVE IT BACK WHEN YOU'RE THROUGH.

261
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,113
SEE YOU GUYS.

262
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,114
BYE BYE.

263
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,115
BYE.

264
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,617
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD!

265
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,618
POOR MONICA!

266
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,120
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?

267
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,123
WHAT? HE WAS WITH HER WHEN HE WROTE THIS POEM.

268
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,126
LOOK. "MY VESSEL SO LOVELY WITH NOTHING INSIDE.

269
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,129
NOW THAT I'VE TOUCHED YOU, YOU SEEM EMPTIER STILL."

270
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,631
HE THINKS MONICA'S EMPTY.

271
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,133
SHE'S THE EMPTY VASE. "VOZ"? VASE?

272
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,635
MONICA'S NOT AN EMPTY VASE.

273
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,636
OH, YOU THINK VASE?

274
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,639
YOU REALLY THINK THAT'S WHAT HE MEANT?

275
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,141
TOTALLY. OH, GOD.

276
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,143
OH, SHE SEEMED SO HAPPY, TOO.

277
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,645
DONE.

278
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,648
WHAT HAPPENED?

279
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,150
JOEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS POEM MEANS?

280
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,152
WELL, MONICA'S THE VASE, RIGHT?

281
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,155
YOU ARE SUCH A MYSTERY TO ME.

282
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,670
DO YOU HAVE THE RALPH LAUREN FILE?

283
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,671
OH, YEAH. SURE.

284
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,172
IT'S, UH, RIGHT...

285
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:17,176

286
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,679
WHAT'S THAT?

287
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,180
IT'S, UH, FROM ROSS.

288
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,181
IT'S A LOVE BUG.

289
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,683
WOW.

290
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,186
SOMEBODY WANTS PEOPLE TO KNOW YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

291
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,187
OH, NO.

292
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,189
NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT HE'S DOING.

293
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,691
HE'S JUST... HE'S JUST REALLY ROMANTIC.

294
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,693
 EXCUSE ME

295
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,695
ARE YOU RACHEL GREEN?

296
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,196
YES, I AM.

297
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,197

298
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,198
ONE, TWO, THREE.

299
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,200
? CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR FIRST WEEK ?

300
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,201

301
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,204

302
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,706
? OOMBA, OOMBA, OOMBA ?

303
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,208

304
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,210
? YOUR ONE AND ONLY BOYFRIEND ?

305
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,712

00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,715

307
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,716
? ROSS! ?

308
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,225
I'M HURT.

309
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,728
I'M ACTUALLY HURT THAT YOU WOULD THINK

310
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,730
I WOULD SEND YOU ANY OF THOSE THINGS

311
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,732
OUT OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN LOVE.

312
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,233
HURT. HURT.

313
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,735
ALL RIGHT, ROSS.

314
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,236
I GET IT. YOU'RE HURT.

315
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,739
OH, MY GOD-- CAN'T A GUY SEND A BARBERSHOP QUARTET

316
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,240
TO HIS GIRLFRIEND'S OFFICE ANYMORE?

317
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,742
OH...

318
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,746
OH, PLEASE, ROSS, IT WAS SO OBVIOUS.

319
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,749
IT WAS LIKE YOU WERE MARKING YOUR TERRITORY.

320
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,250
I MEAN, YOU MIGHT AS WELL

321
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,251
HAVE JUST COME IN

322
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,753
AND PEED ALL AROUND MY DESK.

323
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,757
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

324
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,261
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, OKAY?

325
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,263
MARK EXPLAINED IT ALL TO ME.

326
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,766
HE SAID THIS IS WHAT YOU GUYS DO.

327
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,268
YEAH, WELL, IF, IF, IF MARK SAID THAT

328
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,770
THEN MARK'S AN IDIOT.

329
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,771
MARK'S A GENIUS.

330
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,272
WHY? HOW? HOW IS HE A GENIUS?

331
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,775
LOOK, DON'T YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

332
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,777
INSTEAD OF HITTING ON HER RIGHT AWAY

333
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,779
HE'S BECOMING HER CONFIDANTE.

334
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,280
NOW, HE'S GOING TO BE THE GUY

335
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,783
THAT SHE GOES TO TO COMPLAIN ABOUT YOU.

336
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,285
OH...

337
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,286
YOU OKAY OVER THERE?

338
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,789
YEAH. I TRIED TAKING A DANCE CLASS TODAY

339
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,291
TO GET READY FOR THIS CALLBACK TOMORROW.

340
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,292
HOW'D IT GO?

341
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,293
KNOCKED OVER A GIRL.

342
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,795
YEAH, GOOD WORK.

343
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,296
CAN WE GET BACK TO THE MARK THING?

344
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,297
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

345
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,299
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU SEND HER A MUSICAL BUG?

346
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,801
OH, NO. YOU ALREADY DID THAT.

347
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,805
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

348
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,307
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THERE YOURSELF NOW, OKAY?

349
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,809
MAKE A FEW SURPRISE VISITS.

350
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,310
I DON'T KNOW, YOU GUYS.

351
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,812
ALL RIGHT, FINE. DON'T DO ANYTHING.

352
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,313
JUST SIT HERE AND TALK TO US.

353
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,315
MEANWHILE, SHE IS TALKING TO HIM ABOUT YOU

354
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,817
AND HE'S BEING MR. JOE SENSITIVE

355
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,820
AND SHE STARTS THINKING, "MAYBE THIS IS THE GUY FOR ME

356
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,321
BECAUSE HE UNDERSTANDS ME."

357
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,324
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, SHE'S WITH HIM

358
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:49,829
AND YOU'LL BE ALL, "OH, MAN," AND HE'LL BE ALL,"YES."

359
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,831
HUH?

360
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,834
AND US, WE'LL BE LIKE, "OH, DUDE."

361
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,335
OKAY?

362
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,338
AND PRETTY SOON, YOU'LL BE LIKE, "HI."

363
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,340
AND, AND, AND, "WELL, I CAN'T GO.

364
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,844
RACHEL AND MARK MIGHT BE THERE."

365
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,347
AND WE'LL BE LIKE, "MAN, GET OVER IT.

366
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,349
IT'S BEEN FOUR YEARS."

367
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,355
HE PAINTS QUITE A PICTURE, DOESN'T HE?

368
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,360
HERE'S THE SHELLY SEGAL STUFF FOR DECEMBER.

369
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,863
OH, WAIT, I'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

370
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,864
OH.MARK.

371
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,866
IT'S OKAY. RACHEL KNOWS.

372
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,868
YEAH, BUT EVEN SO.

373
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,369
I CAN'T HELP IT.

374
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,871
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST...

375
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,873
I'M JUST CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

376
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,875
OH, THAT IS SO SWEET.

377
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,876
 OKAY, OKAY

378
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,878
I KNOW I'M LIKE MR. INAPPROPRIATE TODAY

379
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,879
BUT IT'S JUST SO TOUGH.

380
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,881
I MEAN, I SEE YOU WALKING AROUND

381
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,883
AND I JUST WANT TO TOUCH YOU AND HOLD YOU.

382
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:44,884
COME ON,

383
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:45,885
NO ONE'S AROUND.

384
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:46,886
JUST KISS ME.

385
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,387
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

386
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,388
GET OFF OF HER!

387
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,890
WHAT IS GOING ON?

388
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,391
WHAT'S GOING ON?

389
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,893
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON.

390
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,394
ROSS!

391
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,901
I HAVE BEEN DOWN IN YOUR STORE

392
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,904
FOR TWENTY MINUTES TRYING TO GET A TIE.

393
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,909
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO GET SOME SERVICE?

394
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,913
HI, RACH, UH...

395
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,421
UH, JOEY?

396
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,923
JOEY TRIBBIANI?

397
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,928
LISTEN, JOEY, I GOT A PROBLEM.

398
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,931
I JUST GOT A CALL FROM MY DANCE CAPTAIN.

399
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,933
HE'S HAVING A RELATIONSHIP CRISIS

400
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,435
AND CAN'T GET OUT OF LONG ISLAND.

401
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,437
SO DOES THAT MEAN THE AUDITION'S OFF?

402
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,438
LISTEN, JOEY

403
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,941
SEEING AS YOU'VE GOT THE MOST EXPERIENCE

404
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,442
I WANT YOU TO TAKE THESE DANCERS

405
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,444
AND TEACH THEM THE COMBINATION.

406
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,948
WHAT?

407
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,449
AW, JOEY, COME ON.

408
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,450
IT'S EASY.

409
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,954
YOU KNOW, IT'S HAND HAND, HEAD, HEAD, UP

410
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,456
PAS DE BOURREE, PAS DE BOURREE

411
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,458
BIG TURN HERE, RONDE DES CHAMPS

412
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,459
CESSANT, CESSANT

413
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,461
SLIDE BACK, TOUCH, STEP STEP AND...

414
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,463
JAZZ HANDS.

415
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:10,469
IT'S A STEPITY STEP AND JAZZ HANDS.

416
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,470
HAVE FUN.

417
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,472
BYE.

418
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:17,977
HEY.

419
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,478
HEY.

420
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,479
WHAT ARE YOU WRAPPING?

421
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,482
OH, LOOK WHAT I GOT JULIO.

422
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,486
YEAH. IT'S A VASE.

423
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,988
YEAH.

424
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,489
JUST LIKE THE ONE IN THE POEM.

425
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,992
WELL, NOT EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE IN THE POEM.

426
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,494
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

427
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,496
REMEMBER HOW YOU SAID THAT YOU

428
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,998
WERE REALLY DENSE ABOUT POETRY?

429
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,499
YEAH.

430
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,501
OH.

431
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,506
SO I'M JUST AN EMPTY VASE, HUH?

432
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,508
WHAT?

433
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,510
SO I DON'T READ AS MANY IMPORTANT BOOKS AS YOU DO

434
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,513
AND I DON'T WRITE "TRICK POEMS" THAT SEEM TO BE ABOUT ONE THING

435
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,016
BUT ARE ACTUALLY ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

436
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,518
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I GET EXCITED ABOUT STUPID STUFF--

437
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,021
LIKE WHEN MY PEOPLE MAGAZINE COMES ON SATURDAY

438
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,023
AND THE NEW "HOLD EVERYTHING" CATALOG.

439
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,025
YOU KNOW, BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN I'M EMPTY.

440
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,526
YOU KNOW, I CARE ABOUT THINGS.

441
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,528
I CARE ABOUT MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

442
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,530
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO MAKE THAT KIND OF JUDGMENT...

443
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,531
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

444
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,033
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

445
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,035
THE POEM IS NOT ABOUT YOU.

446
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,537
WHAT?

447
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,540
"THE EMPTY VASE" IS NOT ABOUT YOU.

448
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,042
MY BABY, PRECIOSA.

449
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,043
YOU MAKE ME SO SAD

450
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,045
THAT YOU WOULD THINK THIS.

451
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,547
I'M SORRY, IT'S...

452
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,050
MY FRIEND PHOEBE SAID...

453
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,052
NO. IT'S...

454
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,054
IT'S ABOUT ALL WOMEN.

455
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:40,059
WELL, ALL AMERICAN WOMEN.

456
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,562
YOU FEEL BETTER NOW?

457
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,565
AW... YEAH.

458
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,069
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

459
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,071

460
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,589
NO, NO, NO...

461
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,591
WHAT WAS THAT?

462
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,592
I DON'T KNOW.

463
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,096
IT'S THE BEST I COULD GET OUT OF THEM.

464
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,097
WELL, PEOPLE.

465
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,100
PEOPLE, PEOPLE, PEOPLE.

466
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,601
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN

467
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,104
AND THIS TIME, LET'S EVERYBODY

468
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,606
WATCH JOEY.

469
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,108
SHOW THEM HOW IT'S DONE.

470
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,116
COUNT IT OFF, LARRY.

471
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,118

472
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,629
SO, DID YOU HAVE FUN

473
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,131
AT THE BACHELOR PARTY LAST NIGHT?

474
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,132
OH, YEAH, YEAH. LOOK WHAT I GOT.

475
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,134
SEE? SHE'S FULLY DRESSED, RIGHT?

476
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,635
RIGHT.

477
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,138
AND THEN YOU CLICK IT AND, UH OH, SHE'S NAKED

478
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,141
AND THEN YOU CLICK IT AGAIN AND SHE'S DRESSED.

479
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,642
SHE'S A BUSINESS WOMAN.

480
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,145
SHE'S WALKING DOWN THE STREET.

481
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,148
SHE'S WINDOW SHOPPING AND, OH, OH, OH--

482
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,150
SHE'S NAKED.

483
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,656
HI.

484
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,158
HELLO.

485
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,660
YOU KNOW WHAT?

486
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,163
I'M GOING TO SPEND SOME ALONE TIME

487
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,164
WITH THE PEN.

488
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,672
I'M SORRY.

489
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,175
I WAS AN IDIOT.

490
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,176
BIG IDIOT.

491
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,678
A BIG IDIOT.

492
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,680
WHAT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE IS

493
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,184
THIS WHOLE MARK THING IS REALLY HARD FOR ME.

494
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,185
HONEY, WHY IS IT HARD?

495
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,188
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR ALMOST A YEAR NOW.

496
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,191
WELL, I WAS WITH CAROL FOR LIKE EIGHT YEARS

497
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,693
AND I LOST HER

498
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,695
AND NOW, IF IT'S POSSIBLE

499
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,198
I THINK I LOVE YOU EVEN MORE.

500
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,200
SO IT'S HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE

501
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,701
I'M NOT GOING TO...

502
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,203
WELL, THAT SOMEONE ELSE

503
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,206
ISN'T GOING TO TAKE YOU AWAY.

504
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,708
LET IT BE ME. LET IT BE ME.

505
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,714
HONEY...

506
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,217
THAT'S VERY SWEET.

507
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,219
IT JUST SEEMS TO ME, THOUGH

508
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,221
THAT IF TWO PEOPLE LOVE EACH OTHER

509
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,223
AND TRUST EACH OTHER, LIKE WE DO

510
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,226
THERE'S NO REASON TO BE JEALOUS.

511
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,235
I GOT TO GET GOING.

512
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,736
BYE, CHANDLER.

513
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,739
OKAY, ROSS. LISTEN, THIS PEN'S GETTING KIND OF BORING

514
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,741
SO CAN YOU PICK ME UP SOME PORN?

515
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,745
WHERE YOU GOING?

516
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,247
OH, I'VE GOT TO GO PICK UP BEN.

517
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,748
WE'VE GOT A PLAY DATE THIS AFTERNOON.

518
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,750
OH. WITH WHO?

519
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,753
JUST THIS WOMAN I MET LAST NIGHT AT THE PARTY.

520
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,255
THERE WAS A WOMAN AT...?

521
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,758
THE STRIPPER?

522
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,760
YEAH.

523
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,264
YOU HAVE A PLAY DATE WITH A STRIPPER?

524
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,767
MAN, I GOT TO GET A KID.

525
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,771

526
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,274
UH, YEAH.

527
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,776
YEAH. WE STARTED TALKING

528
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,278
AFTER SHE, YOU KNOW, DID HER THING

529
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,281
AND IT TURNS OUT SHE'S GOT A BOY ABOUT BEN'S AGE

530
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,783
SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE KIDS TO A GYMBOREE CLASS.

531
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,285
IS THAT OKAY?

532
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,786
SURE. IS SHE MARRIED?

533
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,787
UH, NO.

534
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,289
HUH.

535
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,295
ARE YOU JEALOUS?

536
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,297
NO.

537
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,799
YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T SEE WHY SHE HAS

538
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,301
TO PLAY WITH YOU, THAT'S ALL.

539
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,802
I MEAN DOESN'T SHE, YOU KNOW

540
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,306
HAVE ANY OTHER STRIPPER MOM FRIENDS OF HER OWN?

541
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,311
YOU ARE TOTALLY JEALOUS.

542
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,313
OH... I'M NOT JEALOUS, ALL RIGHT?

543
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,814
THIS IS ABOUT...

544
00:21:55,814 --> 00:22:00,319
UH, PEOPLE FEELING CERTAIN THINGS...

545
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,821
YOU KNOW, ABOUT...

546
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,822
STRIPPERS

547
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,325
AND, YOU KNOW, AND, UH...

548
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,327
HONEY, I LOVE YOU, TOO.

549
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,328
UGH... BYE.

550
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,329
WAIT.

551
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,331
WHAT?

552
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,340

553
