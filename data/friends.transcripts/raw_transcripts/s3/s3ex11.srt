1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,005
OKAY, PICK A CARD, ANY CARD.

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,007
ALL RIGHT, NOW MEMORIZE IT.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,009
SHOW IT TO EVERYBODY.

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,011
MM HMM. GOT IT?

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,013
ALL RIGHT, GIVE IT BACK TO ME.

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,519
FIVE OF HEARTS.

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,521
REAL MAGIC DOES EXIST.

8
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,522
WOW.

9
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,025
WOW, JOEY, HOW DO YOU DO IT?

10
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,526
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT. NO.

11
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,528

12
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,032
UH, SOMEBODY'S AT THE DOOR ON THE CEILING.

13
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,534
NO, THAT'S OUR UNBELIEVABLY LOUD

14
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,536
UPSTAIRS NEIGHBOR.

15
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,537
HE TOOK UP THE CARPETS

16
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,039
AND NOW YOU CAN HEAR EVERYTHING.

17
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,540
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GO UP THERE

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,043
AND ASK HIM TO JUST, LIKE, STEP LIGHTLY, PLEASE?

19
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,544
I HAVE, LIKE, FIVE TIMES

20
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,046
BUT THE GUY IS SO CHARMING

21
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,547
THAT I GO UP THERE TO YELL

22
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,050
AND THEN I END UP APOLOGIZING TO HIM.

23
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,052
OH, THAT IS SILLY.

24
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,053
I'LL GO UP THERE.

25
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,555
I'LL TELL HIM TO KEEP IT DOWN.

26
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,557
GOOD LUCK. ALL RIGHT,   BE MY GUEST.

27
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,559
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,ALL RIGHT

28
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,560
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW

29
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,062
HOW I DID IT, I'LL SHOW YOU.

30
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,064
WHEN YOU HANDED ME BACK THE CARD

31
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,566
WHAT YOU DIDN'T SEE WAS I LOOKED AT IT SO FAST

32
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,568
IT WAS INVISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE.

33
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,573
I JUST DID IT.

34
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,574
I JUST DID IT AGAIN.

35
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,076
HERE, I'LL SLOW IT DOWN

36
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,578
SO YOU GUYS CAN SEE IT. READY?

37
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,082
OH! OH! OH!

38
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,583
OKAY! YEAH!

39
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,586

40
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,588

41
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,592
YEAH, LOOK, I LIVE WITH MY FRIENDS DOWNSTAIRS

42
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,596

44
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,601

45
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,604
OH, THANK YOU!

46
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:54,614

47
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,616

58
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,154
HI.

59
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,156
ANYBODY GOT A LENGTH OF ROPE

60
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,658
ABOUT SIX FEET LONG, LITTLE NOOSE AT THE END?

61
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,659
HONEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

62
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,660
I JUST SAW JANICE.

63
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,162

64
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,664
YEAH, SHE WAS AT ROCKEFELLER CENTER

65
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,666
SKATING WITH HER HUSBAND.

66
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,667
SHE LOOKED SO HAPPY.

67
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,169
ALMOST FEEL BAD

68
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,172
FOR WHIPPING THAT KID'S PRETZEL AT THEM.

69
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,173
MAN, I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME

70
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,675
I SAW THAT GIRL KATHERINE AFTER WE BROKE UP.

71
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,677
SHE WAS JUST WALKING WITH HER FRIEND DONNA

72
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,179
JUST LAUGHING AND TALKING...

73
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,180
GOD, IT KILLED ME.

74
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,681
YES, BUT YOU ENDED UP

75
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,684
HAVING SEX WITH BOTH OF THEM THAT AFTERNOON.

76
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,686
SORRY.

77
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,189
JUST ANY EXCUSE TO TELL THAT STORY.

78
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,193
HEY, CHANDLER, THERE'S A PARTY TOMORROW.

79
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,694
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER THEN.

80
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,695
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

81
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,197
I'M GOING TO... I'M GOING TO BE OKAY.

82
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,698
YOU DON'T HAVE TO THROW A PARTY FOR ME.

83
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,200
IT'S JOEY'S BIRTHDAY.

84
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,202
OH, WELL, THEN, IF ANYBODY SHOULD HAVE A PARTY

85
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,203
IT SHOULD BE HIM.

86
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,206
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

87
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,207
SHH!

88
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,211
I CANNOT BELIEVE SHE'S STILL UP THERE.

89
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,714

90
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,717

91
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,221
OKAY, WELL, HE TOTALLY SCREWED UP THE PUNCH LINE.

92
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,723
YOU KNOW, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE...

93
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,227

94
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,233
HOW'S THAT COFFEE COMING, DEAR?

95
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,735
YEAH, RIGHT AWAY, MR. KAPLAN.

96
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,737
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO DRINK COFFEE.

97
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,739
IT MAKES ME GASSY.

98
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,741
I KNOW.

99
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,243
I'LL BET YOU'RE THINKING

100
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,245
WHAT'S AN INTELLIGENT GIRL

101
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,746
WHO WANTS TO BE IN FASHION

102
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,748
DOING MAKING COFFEE, HUH?

103
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,250
HUH?

104
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,751
HA! YOU GOT ME.

105
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,254
DON'T THINK I HAVEN'T NOTICED YOUR POTENTIAL.

106
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,256
WELL, I'VE GOT A PROJECT FOR YOU

107
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,258
THAT'S A LOT MORE RELATED TO FASHION.

108
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,759
HOW DOES THAT SOUND?

109
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,760
OH, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

110
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,262
COME ON OVER HERE, SWEETHEART.

111
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,764
THANK YOU SO MUCH, MR. KAPLAN.

112
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,266
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

113
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,269
I NEED THESE HANGERS SEPARATED A.S.A.P.

114
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,771

115
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,777
OH, GOD, I HATE MY JOB. I HATE IT.

116
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,279
I HATE MY JOB. I HATE IT.

117
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,780
I KNOW, HONEY. I'M SORRY.

118
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,781
OH, I WANT TO QUIT

119
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,284
BUT THEN I THINK I SHOULD STICK IT OUT

120
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,786
BUT THEN I THINK WHY WOULD SUCH A PERSON STAY

121
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,288
IN SUCH A DEMEANING JOB

122
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,290
JUST BECAUSE IT'S REMOTELY RELATED

123
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,792
TO THE FIELD THEY'RE INTERESTED IN?

124
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,296
GEE, I DON'T KNOW, RACH.

I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T...

130
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,805
I DON'T MIND PAYING MY DUES, YOU KNOW?

131
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,308
IT'S JUST... HOW MUCH AM I GOING TO LEARN ABOUT FASHION

00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,323
THIS IS ACTUALLY MY JOB.

141
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,325
OH, BELIEVE ME, I I I'VE BEEN THERE.

142
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,826
I HAD TO SORT MANNEQUIN HEADS

143

00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,844
UH, JUST, UH, ONE OTHER THING?

151
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,346

WELL, HE'S VERY CHARMING.

00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,371
I KNOW, HE'S TOO CHARMING

161
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,872
BUT IF YOU TWO START GOING OUT

162
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,374
THEN, IT'S JUST GOING TO MAKE IT

163
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,875
SO MUCH HARDER FOR ME TO HATE HIM.

164
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,877
WELL, YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO TRY.

00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,911
HI.

00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,420

00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,921

00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,924
TO SEE IF HE CAN GET ME AN INTERVIEW!

191
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:05,925
WOW.

192
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,926

194
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,929

HUH.

199
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,941
SOUNDS LIKE MARK SOMETHING WANTS TO HAVE SOME SEX.

200
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,943
WHAT?

201
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,446
I'M JUST SAYING, I MEAN, WHY ELSE WOULD HE JUST

00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,948

00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,950

204
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,952
HEY, JOEY, UH, ARE MEN EVER NICE

205
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,954

NO. ONLY FOR SEX.

207
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,459
THANK YOU.

208
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,962
SO, DID YOU, UH, DID YOU TELL MARK SOMETHING ABOUT ME?

209
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,465
I DIDN'T HAVE TO BECAUSE I WAS WEARING

210
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,467
MY "I HEART ROSS" SANDWICH BOARD

211
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,968
AND RINGING MY BELL.

212
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,472

213
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,474
 JOEY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

214
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,478
HEY EY EY EY!

215
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,481
OKAY, HOW MANY OF THAT GIRL ARE YOU SEEING?

216
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,985
HOW HAMMERED ARE YOU, HUH?

217
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,487
THESE ARE JOEY'S SISTERS.

218
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,988
HI, JOEY'S SISTERS!

219
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,991
HEY, WHAT ARE WE DRINKING OVER HERE?

220
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,994
OH, WELL, I HAVE A VODKA AND CRANBERRY JUICE.

221
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,496
NO KIDDING?

222
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,998
THAT'S THE EXACT SAME DRINK I MADE MYSELF

223
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,500
RIGHT AFTER I SHOT MY HUSBAND.

224
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,503
WOW.

225
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,506
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TALK TO YOU.

226
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,509
WHAT YOU DOING?

227
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,511
OH, I'M TAKING MY EX GIRLFRIEND

228
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,012
OFF MY SPEED DIALER.

229
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,514
OHH! OHH!

230
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,516
NO, NO, NO. NO, IT'S A GOOD THING.

231
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,518
WHY MUST WE DIAL SO SPEEDILY ANYWAY?

232
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,520
WHY MUST WE RUSH THROUGH LIFE?

233
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,022
WHY CAN'T WE SAVOR THE PRECIOUS MOMENTS?

234
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:46,526
THOSE ARE SOME HUGE BREASTS YOU HAVE.

235
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,527
HI.

236
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,528
HI.

237
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,531
YEAH, SO, UM, I HEARD ABOUT THIS, UH, MARK GUY

00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,037
SO, UH, YEAH, PRETTY, PRETTY...

00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,539

243
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,541
OH, HE IS, AND HE IS SO DREAMY.

244
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,042
I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHAT?

245
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,545
WHEN HE LEFT, I ACTUALLY USED THE PHRASE

246
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,547
"HUMMINA HUMMINA HUMMINA."

247
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,050
THAT'S EXCELLENT.

248
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,557
SO, HE'S JUST A NICE GUY.

249
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,559
YOU REALLY THINK THIS MARK DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING

250
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,060
IN EXCHANGE FOR HELPING YOU?

251
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,564
WELL, I ASSUME I'LL HAVE TO TAKE SHOWERS WITH HIM

252
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,066
BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S TRUE OF ANY JOB.

253
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,570

254
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,071
UH OH.

255
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,573
HOW YOU FEELING?

256
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,075
WELL, MY APARTMENT ISN'T THERE ANYMORE

257
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,078
BECAUSE I DRANK IT.

258
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,079
WHERE'D YOU GET TO?

259
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,582
WE LOST YOU AFTER YOU OPENED UP ALL THE PRESENTS.

260
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,583
YEAH.

261
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,585
YEAH, I ENDED UP IN THE STORAGE ROOM

262
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,087
AND NOT ALONE.

263
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,589
 WHOO HOO!

264
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,591
AH, NO "WHOO HOOING."

265
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,593
NO "WHOO HOOING."

266
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,595
WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?

267
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,097
UH...

268
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,600
I FOOLED AROUND WITH JOEY'S SISTER.

269
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,101

270
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,603
WELL, THAT'S NOT THE WORST PART.

271
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,605
WHAT IS THE WORST PART?

272
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,607
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH SISTER.

273
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,109
YOU SEE WHAT MEN DO?

274
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,612
DON'T TELL ME MEN ARE NICE.

275
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,613
THISIS MEN!

276
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,115
ARE YOU INSANE?

277
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,617
I MEAN, JOEY'S GOING TO KILL YOU.

278
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,118
HE'S ACTUALLY GOING TO KILL YOU DEAD.

279
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,621
OKAY. YOU DON'T THINK I THOUGHT OF THAT?

280
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,623
HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW WHICH ONE?

281
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,124
I MEAN, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

282
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,626
I MEAN, WAS IT GINA?

283
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,627
WHICH ONE IS GINA?

284
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,629
THE DARK... BIG HAIR, THE AIRPLANE EARRINGS.

285
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,631
NO, NO, NO, THAT'S NOT GINA. THAT'S DINA.

286
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,632
YOU SEE?!

287
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,635
YOU CAN'T TELL WHICH IS WHICH EITHER. THWA!

288
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,637
BUT WE DIDN'T FOOL AROUND

289
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,640
WITH ANY OF THEM. THWA! THWA!

290
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,144
VERONICA. LOOK, IT'S GOT TO BE VERONICA--

291
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,646
THE GIRL IN THE RED SKIRT.

292
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,148
I DEFINITELY STUCK MY TONGUE DOWN HER THROAT.

293
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,150
THAT WAS ME.

294
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,154
OH, LOOK, WHEN I'VE BEEN DRINKING

295
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,157
SOMETIMES I TEND TO GET A LITTLE OVERLY FRIENDLY

296
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,158
AND I'M I'M SORRY.

297
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,159
THAT'S OKAY.

298
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,160
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

299
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,662
THAT'S OKAY.

300
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,668
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

301
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,170
HEY, JOEY.

302
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,174
COME ON.

303
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,177
WHY CAN'T WE TALK IN HERE...

304
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,179
W WITH WITNESSES?

305
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,181
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH MY SISTER.

306
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,182

00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,183

00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,184
MARY ANGELA.

309
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,185
YEAH.

00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,187
NOW... WHICH ONE IS SHE AGAIN?

311
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,689
WHY DON'T YOU ASK CHANDLER?

312
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,190
BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE

313
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,692
WHO FOOLED AROUND WITH HER.

314
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,695
SHE TOLD ME YOU SAID YOU COULD REALLY FALL FOR HER.

315
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,198
NOW, IS THAT TRUE OR ARE YOU JUST GETTING OVER JANICE

316
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,701
BY GROPING MY SISTER?

317
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,203
IT'S GOT TO BE THE FIRST ONE.

318
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,705
REALLY?

319
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,206

321
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,715

323
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,219
DID MARK CALL?

324
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,220
NO, HONEY, I'M SORRY

325
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,722
BUT THE WEEKEND'S NOT OVER YET.

326
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,223

327
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,225

328
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,227
OH, MY GOD, IS THAT PHOEBE?

329
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,229
GUESS THEY'RE BACK FROM THEIR DATE.

330
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,230
OH.

331
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,232

00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,244

336
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,746
OH, MY GOD.

337
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,249

338
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,250
SO, HOW ARE YOU?

339
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,251
I AM GOOD.

340
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,253
I FINISHED MY BOOK.

341
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,254
OH, YEAH? WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

342
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,756
I DON'T REMEMBER.

343
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,757
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A WALK?

344
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,258
YEAH. YEAH, I DO.

345
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,260

346
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,763
"DEAR MARY ANGELA:

347
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,765
"HI. HOW'S IT GOING?

348
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,267
THIS IS THE HARDEST LETTER I'VE EVER HAD TO WRITE."

349
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,270
WHAT THE HELL'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

350
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,271
HOW DO YOU THINK JOEY'S GOING TO REACT

351
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,273
WHEN HE FINDS OUT YOU BLEW OFF HIS SISTER WITH A LETTER?

352
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,276
WELL, THAT'S THE PART WHERE YOU TELL HIM

353
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,277
THAT I MOVED TO FRANCE...

354
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,780
WHEN, ACTUALLY, I'LL BE IN CUBA.

355
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,781
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, LOOK

356
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,783

00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,784
IN PERSON.

358
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,285
AT LEAST YOU KNOW HER NAME.

359
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,286
YOU JUST GO TO THE HOUSE

360
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,288
AND YOU ASK FOR MARY ANGELA, OKAY?

361
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,290
WHEN WHICHEVER ONE SHE IS COMES TO THE DOOR

362
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,793
YOU TAKE HER FOR A WALK, YOU LET HER DOWN EASY.

363
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,295
OKAY. WHAT IF MARY ANGELA COMES TO THE DOOR

364
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,797
AND I ASK FOR MARY ANGELA?

365
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,299

WHAT ABOUT YOU?

369
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,822
I'M, UH, I'M HERE TO SEE MARY ANGELA.

370
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,824
YOU ARE SO THE MAN.

371
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,825
COME ON.

372
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,326
NOW, LOOK, LISTEN. LISTEN.

373
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,828
YOU GOT TO BE COOL

374
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,331
BECAUSE MY GRANDMA DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT YOU TWO YET

375
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,834
AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO TICK HER OFF.

376
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,335
SHE WAS, LIKE, THE SIXTH PERSON

377
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,337
TO SPIT ON MUSSOLINI'S HANGING BODY.

378
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,339
YEAH.

379
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,841
WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS?

380
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,843
OH, THEY'RE IN VERMONT, BUYING CIGARETTES.

381
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,845
WHERE'S MARY ANGELA?

382
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,847
SHE'S RIGHT IN THERE.

383
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,348
OKAY.

384
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,349

385
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,851
CHANDLER! HEY, CHANDLER!

386
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,853
HEY! HEY, CHANDLER!

387
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,858
I CAN'T BELIEVE MARK DIDN'T CALL.

388
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,360
IT'S SUNDAY NIGHT AND HE DIDN'T CALL.

389
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,362
BUMMER.

390
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,363
YEAH, RIGHT.

391
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,865
LOOK AT YOU.

392
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,366
YOU'RE PRACTICALLY GIDDY.

393
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,870
NO, I'M GENUINELY SORRY THE MARK THING DIDN'T WORK OUT.

394
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,873
LOOK, RACH, I WANT ONLY GOOD THINGS FOR YOU.

395
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,874
WAIT A MINUTE.

396
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,876
WHY DON'T YOU JUST CALL MARK?

397
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,879
I MEAN, WHO SAYS

398
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,881
YOU HAVE TO SIT HERE AND WAIT FOR HIM?

399
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,382
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE STUFF HAPPEN.

400
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,885
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO SEEM TOO PUSHY.

401
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,386
HONEY, IT'S NOT PUSHY.

402
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,388
HE GAVE HER HIS HOME NUMBER.

403
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,389
HE... WHA...?

404
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,891
HE GAVE YOU HIS HOME NUMBER

405
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,893
AS IN, LIKE, TO TO HIS HOME?

406
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,394
YEAH, AND YOU DON'T MIND IF I CALL

407
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,897
BECAUSE YOU ONLY WANT GOOD THINGS FOR ME.

408
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,398
THAT'S RIGHT-- GOOD THINGS.

409
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,900
THAT THAT IS WHAT I SAID.

410
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,405
HELLO, MARK?

411
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,407
HI, IT'S RACHEL GREEN.

412
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,914
OH, NO, DON'T YOU APOLOGIZE.

413
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,415
YEAH, I'LL HOLD.

414
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,917
HE LEFT MY NUMBER AT WORK.

415
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,418
HE WAS GOING TO GET IT

416
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,921
BUT HE WAS HELPING HIS NIECE WITH HER REPORT

417
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,422
ON THE PIONEERS.

418
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,424
THAT IS SO MADE UP.

419
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,427
YEAH. OH, MY GOD, TOMORROW?

420
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,929
NO, IT'S PERFECT.

421
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,931
OH, GOD, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

422
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,933
GREAT. BYE.

423
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,434
OH! I GOT THE INTERVIEW.

424
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,436
OH, YAY! THERE YOU GO.

425
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,438
HE EVEN OFFERED TO MEET ME FOR LUNCH

426
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,940
AND PREP ME FOR IT.

427
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,941
OH, THAT IS AMAZING!

428
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,444
YEAH. WELL, IF I KNOW MARK-- AND I THINK I DO--

429
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,946

430
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,447
I'D EXPECT NOTHING LESS.

431
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,449
I GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I'M GOING TO WEAR.

432
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,452
HIGH COLLAR AND BAGGY PANTS SAY, "I'M A PRO."

433
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,454
YEAH, RIGHT.

434
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,956
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

435
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,957
WHOO HOO!

436
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,959
YOU GO GET THEM.

437
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,961
WHAT DID I DO TO YOU?

438
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,963
DID I HURT YOU IN SOME WAY?

439
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,464
WHAT?

440
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,966
"WHY DON'T YOU CALL HIM?"

441
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,467
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

442
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,469
YOU KNOW, NOW HE'S GOING TO PREP HER.

443
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,470
YOU KNOW,PREP HER

444
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,972
AS IN WHAT YOU DO

445
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,975
BEFORE YOU SURGICALLY REMOVE THE BOYFRIEND!

446
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,476
ARE YOU CRAZY?

447
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,477
OH, AM I? AM I?

448
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,478
AM I OUT OF MY MIND?

449
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,980
AM I LOSING MY SENSES?

450
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,484
THIS DREAMY GUY IS TAKING MY GIRLFRIEND OUT FOR A MEAL.

451
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,987
ROSS, YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T EVEN ABOUT YOU.

452
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,488
I MEAN, THIS IS ABOUT RACHEL

453
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,990
AND SOMETHING WONDERFUL HAPPENING FOR HER.

454
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,992
OH... I MEAN, YOU KNOW, EVEN IF YOU'RE RIGHT--

455
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,494
WHAT IF HE WANTS TO SLEEP WITH HER?

456
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,996
DOES THAT MEAN HE GETS TO? NO, BUT...

457
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,497
I MEAN, DON'T YOU TRUST HER?

458
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,999
WELL... YEAH, I...

00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,500

00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,539
SO, UM... HMM...

471
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,043

00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,053
IT'S TOPNOTCH.

476
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,554

477
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,057
SO WILL I.

478
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,559
EXCUSE YOURSELF AND GO TO THE BATHROOM.

479
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,561
OH, NO, NO, NO, I WAS JUST SQUINTING.

480
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,063
THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

481
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,065
JUST DO IT.

482
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,571

00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,088
FINALLY! I THOUGHT WE'D NEVER BE ALONE.

486
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,589
CAN I JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING?

487
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,591
I HAVE NOT STOPPED THINKING ABOUT YOU

488
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,592
SINCE THE PARTY.

489
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,094

490
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,596
LOOK, I MAY HAVE JUMPED THE GUN, HERE.

491
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,597
NO.

492
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,598

493
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,599
UH...

494
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,600

495
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,103
I JUST GOT OUT OF A RELATIONSHIP

496
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,604
AND I'M NOT REALLY IN A...

497
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,606
IN A COMMITMENT KIND OF PLACE.

498
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,607
SO? ME NEITHER.

499
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,609
GOD, MARY ANGELA WAS RIGHT.

500
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,111
YOU DO HAVE THE SOFTEST LIPS.

501
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,113
UH...

502
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,614
YOU'RE NOT MARY ANGELA?

503
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,117
NO! I'M MARY THERESE.

504
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,118
THIS IS SO BAD.

505
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,620
IF IF YOU'RE NOT MARY ANGELA

506
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,622
THEN, UH, THEN WHO IS?

507
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,125

508
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,627
OH, IT'S SO BAD.

509
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,628
JOEY!

510
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,630
NO JOEY! NO JOEY! NO JOEY!

511
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,631
JOEY!

512
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,633
WHAT'S GOING ON?

513
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,635
YOU'RE IT.

514
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,137
NOW, RUN AND HIDE.

515
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,138
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

516
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,639
CHANDLER WAS JUST KISSING ME

517
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,142
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT I WAS MARY ANGELA.

518
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,144
WHAT?! HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

519
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,146
HOW COULD YOU THINK SHE WAS MARY ANGELA?

520
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,649
I WASN'T SURE WHICH ONE MARY ANGELA WAS.

521
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,151

522
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,152
LOOK, I'M SORRY, OKAY?

523
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,653
I WAS REALLY DRUNK

524
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,655
AND YOU GUYS ALL LOOK REALLY SIMILAR.

525
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,656
I SAY PUNCH HIM, JOEY.

526
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,657
 YEAH!

527
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,658
YOU KNOW WHAT?

528
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,661
WE SHOULD ALL CALM DOWN BECAUSE, YOU KNOW

529
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,663
YOUR BROTHER'S NOT GOING TO PUNCH ME...

530
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,665
ARE YOU?

531
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,667
WELL, THAT IS USUALLY WHAT I WOULD DO, BUT...

532
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,169
I JUST NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D BE

533
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,670
ON THE RECEIVING END OF IT.

534
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,671
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?!

535
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,673
HEY, WHERE'D EVERYBODY GO?

536
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,675
HEY, NONNA, WHY DON'T YOU GO INTO THE DEN?

537
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,676
I THINK COPSIS ON.

538
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,679
OH! OH! OH! OH...

539
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,184
JOEY, IF YOU WANT TO PUNCH ME, GO AHEAD.

540
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,686
I DESERVE IT, BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

541
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,689
THAT I WOULD NEVER SOBERLY HURT YOU OR YOUR FAMILY.

542
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,191
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND

543
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,194
AND I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER AGAIN.

544
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,197
SO WHAT?

545
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,198
I SAY PUNCH HIM.

546
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,200
YEAH! PUNCH HIM!

547
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,204
NO, NO, NO, I'M NOT GOING TO PUNCH CHANDLER.

548
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,205
I'LL DO IT.

549
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,706
NO, YOU WON'T.

550
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,708
LOOK, HE KNOWS HE DID A TERRIBLE THING

551
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,709
