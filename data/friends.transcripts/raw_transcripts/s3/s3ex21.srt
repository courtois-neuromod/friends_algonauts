558
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:24,837
SO, WHOSE IDEA WAS IT

559
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,339
TO PUT EVERYBODY IN THE DINER ON SKATES?

560
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:27,340
SOME IDIOT CUSTOMER

561
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,842
PUT A SUGGESTION IN THE SUGGESTION BOX.

562
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:30,843
OH, MY GOD!

563
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:31,844
THEY TOOK MY IDEA!

564
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:32,845
THAT WAS YOU?

565
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:33,846
YEAH.

566
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,348
OKAY, THERE YOU GO.

567
00:23:35,348 --> 00:23:37,850
RACHEL, I MADE YOU A COCOA.

568
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,352
OH, MY G... IT'S SO NICE...!

569
00:23:39,352 --> 00:23:40,353
OW!

570
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:41,854
OH, MY GOD!

571
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:43,356
ARE YOU GUYS OKAY?

572
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:45,358
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

573
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:46,359

574
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,361
OH, MY.

575
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:55,868

576
00:23:55,868 --> 00:24:00,873
?  ?

577
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:03,376
?  ?

578
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:05,878
?  ?

579
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:09,882
?  ?

580
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:12,385
?  ?

581
00:24:12,385 --> 00:24:15,888
?  ?

582
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:19,392
?  ?

583
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:21,894
?  ?

584
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:24,397
?  ?

585
00:24:24,397 --> 00:24:26,899
?  ?

586
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:29,402
?  ?

587
00:24:29,402 --> 00:24:33,406
?  ?

588
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:40,413
HEY.

589
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:41,414
HEY.

590
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:42,915
YOU KNOW, WITH THAT GOATEE

591
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,417
YOU KIND OF LOOK LIKE SATAN.

592
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,423
OH, SO THAT'S WHY THE PRIEST THREW HOLY WATER ON ME.

593
00:24:50,423 --> 00:24:52,425
OKAY, LISTEN

594
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:53,926
YOU HAVE TO CHEER UP, OKAY?

595
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,428
YOU SHOULD COME OUT

596
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:56,929
WITH ROSS AND ME.

597
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:58,431
I MEAN, ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN SITTING AROUND HERE

598
00:24:58,931 --> 00:24:59,932
CRYING ALL DAY ABOUT KATE.

599
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:02,435
HEY, I WAS CRYING BECAUSE...

600
00:25:02,435 --> 00:25:06,439
BECAUSE NOBODY BELIEVED QUINCY'S THEORY, OKAY?

601
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,440
HEY. HEY.

602
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,941
I'M GOING TO BE ON TV!

603
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:10,943
NO WAY! YEAH.

604
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,445
THEY'RE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS PANEL

605
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:14,447
TO TALK ABOUT THESE FOSSILS THEY JUST FOUND IN PERU

606
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:16,449
AND THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL'S GOING TO FILM IT.

607
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:17,450
OH, MY GOD!

608
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,453
WHO'S GOING TO WATCH THAT?

609
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:22,455
THANKS. YOU READY TO GO?

610
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:23,456
YEAH.

611
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,457

612
00:25:24,457 --> 00:25:25,958
SAW A GIRL WITH THAT VEST.

613
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,960
THANKS.

614
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,962
While most of us think

615
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:31,464
of chocolate bunnies and baskets

616
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:33,466
as traditional Easter gifts

617
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:36,969
some people insist on giving live chicks as presents.

618
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:39,972
Unfortunately, the sad fact remains

619
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:41,974
that most of these little guys won't live

620
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:42,975
to see the Fourth of July.

621
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:44,477
Because, as a result

622
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:46,979
of improper care, they will be dead.

623
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:49,482
YEAH, HI. YOU GUYS GOT ANY OF THOSE BABY CHICKS?

624
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:52,485
BECAUSE I WAS WATCHING THIS COMMERCIAL ON TV

625
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:54,487
AND, MAN, THOSE THINGS ARE CUTE!

626
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:57,990
HI.

627
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,492
HI. PETE, YOU'RE BACK.

628
00:25:59,492 --> 00:26:01,494
HEY, CHECK THIS OUT.

629
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:03,496
WOW, SKATES.

630
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:05,998
WHOA!

631
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:07,500
WOW.

632
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,502
YOU'RE A LOT STURDIER THAN CHANDLER.

633
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:11,504
HE CRUMPLED LIKE A PIECE OF PAPER.

634
00:26:11,504 --> 00:26:12,505
SO HOW WAS YOUR TRIP?

635
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:16,008
WHAT'D YOU BRING ME?

636
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:17,009
AW...

637
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,011
HOTEL TOILETRIES FROM JAPAN!

638
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:20,513
OH!

639
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:21,514
THESE ARE GOING TO GO

640
00:26:21,514 --> 00:26:23,015
IN MY PERMANENT COLLECTION.

641
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,517
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT SAYS IN ENGLISH?

642
00:26:24,517 --> 00:26:25,518
"MADE IN TEXAS."

643
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:28,020
YOU WANT SOME COFFEE?

644
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,522
YEAH, SURE.

645
00:26:29,522 --> 00:26:31,023
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

646
00:26:32,525 --> 00:26:34,527
REGULAR OR DECAF?

647
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:37,530
UH... WHICHEVER'S CLOSEST.

648
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,532
SO, ASK ME WHAT I DID TODAY.

649
00:26:39,532 --> 00:26:41,534
SO, WHAT DID YOU DO TODAY, PETE?

650
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:42,535
I BOUGHT A RESTAURANT

651
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:44,537
AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO BE THE HEAD CHEF.

652
00:26:44,537 --> 00:26:46,539
WHAT?! OH...!

653
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,044
CAN YOU BELIEVE

654
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:54,046
HE JUST OFFERED ME A RESTAURANT?

655
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:55,047
WHAT A JERK.

656
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,549
WANT ME TO KICK HIS ASS?

657
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:58,050
THIS HAS BEEN, LIKE, MY DREAM

658
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,052
SINCE I GOT MY FIRST EASY BAKE OVEN

659
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:02,054
AND OPENED EASY MONICA'S BAKERY.

660
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:12,565
I MEAN, I WOULD KILL FOR THIS JOB.

661
00:27:12,565 --> 00:27:14,066
I MEAN, I CAN TOTALLY DO THIS JOB

662
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:16,569
AND, GOD KNOWS, I'VE PAID MY DUES.

663
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:20,072
BUT PETE'S JUST DOING THIS

664
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:21,574
BECAUSE HE HAS A CRUSH ON ME.

665
00:27:21,574 --> 00:27:24,076
AND YOU'RE STILL NOT ATTRACTED TO HIM AT ALL?

666
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:27,580
NO. I MEAN, HOW CAN I ACCEPT A RESTAURANT FROM HIM?

667
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,081
I I CAN'T.

668
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,583
I COULDN'T EVEN ACCEPT A NECKLACE

669
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:32,084
FROM STU VINCENT IN THE SEVENTH GRADE.

670
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,587
BUT, MON, THAT WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

671
00:27:34,587 --> 00:27:36,088
HE WAS YOUR HEALTH TEACHER.

672
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,089
OH, PLEASE. OW!

673
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,090
WHAT, HONEY?

674
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,091
OW.

675
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:40,593
MY SIDE STILL HURTS

676
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:42,595
FROM WHEN YOU CRASHED INTO ME YESTERDAY.

677
00:27:42,595 --> 00:27:44,096
GOD, I'M SO SORRY. OW!

678
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,098
OH, GOD!

679
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:47,600
HEY, YOU GUYS, GUESS WHAT.

680
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:54,607
GOT A JOB ON A RIVERBOAT?

681
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:55,608
YOU KNOW WHAT?

682
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:57,610
I DIDN'T WEAR THIS SUIT FOR A YEAR

683
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,611
BECAUSE YOU HATED IT.

684
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:00,112
WELL, GUESS WHAT.

685
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,114
YOU'RE NOT MY GIRLFRIEND ANYMORE, SO...

686
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:04,116
OH, I SEE. SO THIS SUIT IS MAKING A POINT.

687
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,618
NOW THAT YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN

688
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:08,120
YOU'RE FREE TO LOOK AS STUPID AS YOU'D LIKE.

689
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,122
YOU LIKE IT, RIGHT?

690
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:11,624
ABSOLUTELY.

691
00:28:11,624 --> 00:28:13,125
I LIKE IT EVEN MORE ON YOU

692
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,627
THAN I DID ON COLONEL SANDERS.

693
00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:16,629
ROSS, ROSS, I'M KIDDING.

694
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:17,630
WHAT WERE YOU

695
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,631
GOING TO TELL US?

696
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:20,633
WAS IT HOW YOU INVENTED THE COTTON GIN?

697
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:22,635
OKAY, GOOD BYE.

698
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,137
WAS THAT A LITTLE HARSH?

699
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:26,639
OH, COME ON. ARE YOU KIDDING?

700
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:28,140
DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE KIDS

701
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,642
AND YOU USED TO WEAR THAT GRAY SWEATSUIT

702
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:31,644
AND THEY USED TO CALL YOU THE HINDENBURG?

703
00:28:31,644 --> 00:28:33,145
NO.

704
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:36,649
MY MISTAKE.

705
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:41,153
SO, UM, AFTER YOU PUT THE SUGGESTION IN THE BOX

706
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:44,156
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE FOR THE ROLLER SKATING THING TO HAPPEN?

707
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:45,658
UM, ABOUT THREE MONTHS.

708
00:28:45,658 --> 00:28:47,159
OKAY, SO I GUESS

709
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,160
THAT'S ABOUT, UH...

710
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,663
TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE TOPLESS THING KICKS IN.

711
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:53,165
HEY.

712
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:55,668
HEY.

713
00:28:55,668 --> 00:28:57,670
I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

714
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,172
OPEN IT! OPEN IT!

715
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:01,674
OKAY.

716
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:03,676

717
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,681
IT'S A CHICKEN.

718
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:10,683
IT'S CUTE, HUH?

719
00:29:10,683 --> 00:29:11,684
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, YOU GUYS

720
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:13,686
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CHICKS?

721
00:29:13,686 --> 00:29:16,188
FOWL? NO.

722
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:17,690
WOMEN?

723
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,191
NO.

724
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:21,694
HEY, WELL, THEY ARE A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY.

725
00:29:21,694 --> 00:29:25,197
ESPECIALLY AT THIS AGE, THEY REQUIRE CONSTANT CARE.

726
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,699
THEY NEED JUST THE RIGHT FOOD

727
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:28,200
AND LOTS AND LOTS OF LOVE.

728
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,202
OH, WELL, NO PROBLEM.

729
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:33,205

730
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:37,710
EASY, LENNY.

731
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:43,716
SO?

732
00:29:43,716 --> 00:29:45,718
I MEAN, HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT?

733
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:47,219
OKAY, HERE'S THE THING.

734
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:48,721
OH, NO, NOT THE THING.

735
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:50,222
I HATE THE THING.

736
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,724
WHAT'S THE THING?

737
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:54,226
I CAN'T DO IT.

738
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:55,227
I'M SORRY.

739
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:56,729
I WISH I COULD

740
00:29:56,729 --> 00:29:58,230
BUT, UM...

741
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,732
SEE, YOU HAVE THESE FEELINGS FOR ME...

742
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:00,733
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

743
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:02,234
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT?

744
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,236
IF THAT'S THE PROBLEM, WE'VE GOT NO PROBLEM.

745
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:06,238
HUH?

746
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,240
NO, LIKE, I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU THIS OVER DINNER

747
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:10,242
BUT I MET SOMEBODY ELSE ON MY TRIP.

748
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:11,243
OH?

749
00:30:11,744 --> 00:30:12,745
HER NAME'S ANNE.

750
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:14,747
SHE'S A JOURNALIST. WE MET ON THE PLANE.

751
00:30:14,747 --> 00:30:16,749
SHE ASKED ME IF SHE COULD FINISH OFF MY PEANUTS.

752
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:18,250
I THOUGHT SHE SAID SOMETHING ELSE.

753
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,752
WE HAD A BIG LAUGH...

754
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:22,755
YEAH, I JUST...

755
00:30:22,755 --> 00:30:24,757
I MEAN, I GOT TIRED OF WAITING.

756
00:30:24,757 --> 00:30:25,758
THAT'S GREAT!

757
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:27,259
I MEAN, I'M I'M SORRY.

758
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,261
BUT I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

759
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:31,263
AND NOW I CAN WORK FOR YOU.

760
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,264
I GUESS YOU CAN.

761
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:33,766
OH, MY GOD!

762
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:35,768
OH, THIS IS INCREDIBLE!

763
00:30:35,768 --> 00:30:37,269
OH!

764
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,771
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

765
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:40,773
I'M JUST GOING TO ROLL RIGHT INTO THAT OFFICE

766
00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:41,774
AND QUIT!

767
00:30:41,774 --> 00:30:42,775
ALL RIGHT.

768
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:44,777
COULD YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE PUSH?

769
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:46,278
YEAH, SURE.

770
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:47,279
GOOD LUCK.

771
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,280
I'M QUITTING!

772
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,783
WHOO HOO!

773
00:30:50,783 --> 00:30:52,284

774
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:54,286
I'M OKAY! I'M ALL RIGHT!

775
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:59,291
WOW. THAT'S EXCITING.

776
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,794
YOU WENT TO JAPAN, MADE UP A WOMAN.

777
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:03,796
WHAT?

778
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:05,798
I'M JUST SAYING-- THIS WOMAN--

779
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:07,800
I MEAN, SHE'S FICTITIOUS, NO?

780
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,301
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

781
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:11,303
BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL INTO MONICA.

782
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:13,305
SO YOU TOLD HER THERE WAS SOMEBODY ELSE

783
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:14,807
SO SHE WOULD AGREE TO WORK WITH YOU

784
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:17,810
BECAUSE YOU FIGURE IF YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER

785
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,812
MAYBE SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN.

786
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:21,313
YOU'RE GOOD. YOU'RE GOOD.

787
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:23,816
YEAH. NO, I'M FAIRLY INTUITIVE

788
00:31:23,816 --> 00:31:25,317
AND PSYCHIC.

789
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:27,319
IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL GIFT.

790
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,321
LISTEN, CAN YOU PROMISE ME

791
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:31,323
THAT YOU WON'T TELL HER, THOUGH?

792
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:32,825
ABSOLUTELY.

793
00:31:32,825 --> 00:31:33,826
OH, I PROMISE.

794
00:31:33,826 --> 00:31:35,327
TELL HER WHAT?

795
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,830
THANKS A LOT.

796
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,831
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

797
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:40,833
I MEAN, I'M INTUITIVE, BUT MY MEMORY SUCKS.

798
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,837
OKAY, BUT THIS IS THE LAST TIME.

799
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:47,840
? WITH A CHICK CHICK HERE AND A CHICK CHICK THERE ?

800
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,342
? HERE A CHICK, THERE A CHICK, EVERYWHERE ?

801
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:51,343
? A CHICK CHICK... ?

802
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:53,846
CHICKEN...

803
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:55,848
HEY.

804
00:31:55,848 --> 00:31:56,849
HEY.

805
00:31:56,849 --> 00:31:58,851
HOW'S SHE DOING?

806
00:31:58,851 --> 00:31:59,852
SHE?

807
00:31:59,852 --> 00:32:02,354
WELL, YEAH. DON'T YOU THINK IT'S A SHE?

808
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:04,356
I DON'T KNOW.

809
00:32:12,865 --> 00:32:14,366
I CAN'T TELL.

810
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:17,369
WHATEVER IT WAS WENT BACK IN TOO QUICKLY.

811
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,371
WELL, ANYWAY, I GOT TO GO CHANGE.

812
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:22,374
I'M MEETING SOME OF THE CAST FOR DRINKS.

813
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:23,375
EXCUSE ME?

814
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:24,877
WHAT?

815
00:32:24,877 --> 00:32:26,378
I STAYED HOME FROM WORK TODAY

816
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:27,880
WHILE YOU WERE AT REHEARSAL

817
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,882
SO SOMEBODY COULD BE HERE WITH OUR CHICK.

818
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:32,384
HEY, WHO WAS UP FROM 2:00 THIS MORNING

819
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:35,888
UNTIL 5:00 THIS MORNING TRYING TO GET HER BACK TO SLEEP?

820
00:32:35,888 --> 00:32:39,391
YOU DON'T THINK I GET UP WHEN YOU GET UP?

821
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,393
OH, HERE IT COMES.

822
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:42,394
YES.

823
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:43,896
HERE IT COMES.

824
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:45,397
I'M STUCK HERE ALL DAY

825
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:46,398
AND THEN YOU COME IN

826
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,400
AND SPEND TWO SECONDS WITH US...

827
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:52,404
AND THEN EXPECT TO GO OFF GALLIVANTING

828
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:53,906
WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

829
00:32:53,906 --> 00:32:55,908
WELL, I DON'T THINK SO, MISTER.

830
00:32:55,908 --> 00:32:57,409
HEY, I NEED TO RELAX.

831
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:58,410
OKAY?

832
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,412
I WAS WORKING ALL DAY.

833
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:01,413
AND YOU DON'T THINK

834
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,916
TAKING CARE OF OUR CHICK IS WORK?

835
00:33:05,918 --> 00:33:07,419
THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.

836
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:08,420
OKAY?

837
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,421
I JUST MEANT...

838
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,423
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT.

839
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:20,432
HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT EVER SINCE WE GOT THIS CHICK

840
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:23,435
WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING A LOT MORE THAN WE USED TO?

841
00:33:25,938 --> 00:33:27,439
I DON'T KNOW--

842
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,942
MAYBE WE WEREN'T READY TO HAVE A CHICK.

843
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:32,945
I SURE WANT ONE SOMEDAY, THOUGH.

844
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:35,948
I KNOW, I KNOW.

845
00:33:35,948 --> 00:33:37,950
I'LL TAKE HER BACK TOMORROW.

846
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,953
DO YOU THINK WE'LL GET OUR THREE BUCKS BACK?

847
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:43,455
HEY.

848
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:44,456
HEY.

849
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:45,457
OH, HEY.

850
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:47,459
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU STILL HAVE THAT.

851
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,961
WE'RE TAKING HER BACK TOMORROW.

852
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:50,963
NO. NO. THAT RIDICULOUS THING

853
00:33:50,963 --> 00:33:52,464
ON YOUR FACE.

854
00:33:52,965 --> 00:33:53,966
THANK YOU.

855
00:33:53,966 --> 00:33:56,468
LISTEN, I HAVE THAT TV THING IN, LIKE, TWO HOURS

856
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:57,970
AND I NEED YOUR HELP, OKAY?

857
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:58,971
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

858
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:00,472
THIS BLUE SUIT OR THIS BROWN ONE?

859
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:01,974
 WELL...

860
00:34:01,974 --> 00:34:03,475
THE BROWN ONE BRINGS OUT YOUR EYES.

861
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:05,978
BUT YOUR BUTT LOOKS GREAT IN THE BLUE ONE.

862
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:08,480
REALLY?

863
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:14,486
OW!

864
00:34:19,992 --> 00:34:22,494
OH!

865
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:23,495
WOW.

866
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:26,498
THAT ASPIRIN DANCE REALLY WORKS.

867
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,501
OW!

868
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,003
OH, MY GOD, DOES THAT STILL...?

869
00:34:31,003 --> 00:34:32,004
I'M FINE, I'M FINE.

870
00:34:32,004 --> 00:34:33,005
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

871
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:34,006
YES, I AM. RACH...

872
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:35,507
LOOK, I'M FINE. WATCH.

873
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:36,508
LOOK AT THAT.

874
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:37,509
UH UH...

875
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:38,510
OH...!

876
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,012
OKAY, OKAY, LOOK

877
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:42,014
YOU'VE GOT TO GO TO A DOCTOR, OKAY?

878
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:43,015
NO. I HAVE TO GET READY

879
00:34:43,015 --> 00:34:44,516
AND GO TO A DINNER AT MY BOSS'S HOUSE.

880
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:45,517
IT'S A VERY BIG DEAL.

881
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:47,519
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE THAT I HAVE TO MEET.

882
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:49,521
YEAH, AND I'M SURE YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A GREAT IMPRESSION.

883
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:50,522
"HI. I'M RACHEL GREEN.

884
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:53,025
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU."

885
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:54,026
COME ON.

886
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:56,028
YOU PROBABLY HAVE A BROKEN RIB.

887
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:57,529
WELL, I WILL GO TO THE HOSPITAL TOMORROW.

888
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:59,531
IT WILL STILL BE BROKEN THEN.

889
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:02,034
YOU KNOW, I COULD USE A HAND GETTING READY.

890
00:35:02,034 --> 00:35:03,035
RACHEL...

891
00:35:03,035 --> 00:35:04,036
LOOK, EITHER HELP ME OR GO.

892
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:06,038
FINE, I'LL GO.

893
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:09,541
OKAY, BUT BEFORE YOU GO, COULD YOU HELP ME FIRST?

894
00:35:13,045 --> 00:35:14,046
SURE.

895
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:15,547
I'LL HELP YOU.

896
00:35:16,048 --> 00:35:17,049
OH, GOOD. GOOD.

897
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:19,051
DO YOU GUYS KNOW HOW TO GET A CHICK

898
00:35:19,051 --> 00:35:20,052
OUT OF A VCR?

899
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:32,064
YOU KNOW WHAT?

900
00:35:32,064 --> 00:35:35,067
I CANNOT DO THIS WITH MY LEFT HAND.

901
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:37,569
WOULD YOU PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS, TOO?

902
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:38,570
OH...

903
00:35:45,077 --> 00:35:47,579
OKAY, LET'S USE THIS BRUSH.

904
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:48,580
OKAY.

905
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,581
THIS STUFF?

906
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:51,083
YEAH. BE CAREFUL.

907
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:55,087
NOW, YOU WANT TO JUST SWEEP IT ACROSS THE LID.

908
00:35:55,087 --> 00:35:56,088
JUST SWEEP IT.

909
00:35:56,088 --> 00:35:57,089
OKEY DOKEY.

910
00:35:57,089 --> 00:35:58,090
WHOA! SORRY.

911
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,092
THAT'S JUST POKING ME IN THE EYE.

912
00:36:00,092 --> 00:36:01,593
I'M SORRY... CLOSE, CLOSE.

913
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:03,095
OKAY, JUST SWEEP IT.

914
00:36:03,095 --> 00:36:04,096
I'M SWEEPING.

915
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:05,097
SWEEP, SWEEP.

916
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:08,100
OKAY, NOW, MAKE IT EVEN, BECAUSE WE DON'T...

917
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,101
WHAT? WHAT?

918
00:36:09,101 --> 00:36:10,602
WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE TOO MUCH.

919
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:11,603
WE WANT IT TO BE SUBTLE.

920
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:13,105
NO, NO. YOU KNOW

921
00:36:13,105 --> 00:36:15,107
YOU DON'T WEAR ENOUGH OF THIS.

922
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:20,112
SINCE WHEN...

923
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:21,613
SINCE WHEN DO YOU THINK

924
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:23,115
I DON'T WEAR ENOUGH OF THIS?

925
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:24,616
WELL, I... CLOSE YOUR EYES.

926
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:27,619
I JUST THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THIS A LITTLE BETTER

927
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:28,620
BECAUSE... CLOSE, CLOSE...

928
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:30,122
BLOW IT OFF.

929
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:32,624
SORRY. BECAUSE, UM, I THINK THIS WILL MAKE YOU

930
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:34,626
A LITTLE MORE SOPHISTICATED.

931
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:37,129
SOPHISTICATED LIKE A HOOKER?

932
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:38,630

933
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:40,132
HEY.

934
00:36:40,132 --> 00:36:41,133
HEY.

935
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:42,134
GUESS WHAT I'M DOING TONIGHT.

936
00:36:42,134 --> 00:36:43,135
WHAT?

937
00:36:43,135 --> 00:36:45,137
I'M CHECKING OUT THE RESTAURANT WITH PETE.

938
00:36:45,137 --> 00:36:48,140
OH, MONICA, I AM SO EXCITED FOR YOU.

939
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,642
OOH, I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

940
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:51,643
WHAT?

941
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:53,645
WELL, I CAN'T TELL YOU.

942
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:55,647
OKAY, BUT WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER

943
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,149
IF YOU HAD TO TELL ME SOMETHING

944
00:36:57,149 --> 00:36:58,650
THAT YOU COULD TELL ME?

945
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,153
WELL, SURE, IN A PERFECT WORLD.

946
00:37:01,153 --> 00:37:03,155
BUT, NO

947
00:37:03,155 --> 00:37:04,656
I PROMISED I WOULDN'T TELL

948
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:06,658
AND I SWORE TO, LIKE, ALL MY GODS.

949
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,161
OKAY.

950
00:37:09,161 --> 00:37:11,163
DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH ROSS AND RACHEL?

951
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:12,664
NO.

952
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:14,166
DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH JOEY?

953
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:15,167
NO.

954
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:16,668
DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH CHANDLER

955
00:37:17,169 --> 00:37:19,171
AND THAT SOCK THAT HE KEEPS BY HIS BED?

956
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:23,175
NO, BUT LET'S COME BACK TO THAT LATER.

957
00:37:25,177 --> 00:37:27,179
UH... UH... HUH.

958
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:28,680
THERE YOU GO.

959
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,183
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOUR PARTY, HUH?

960
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,190
SURE.

961
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:43,195
SURE, I'LL JUST SIT NEXT TO THE TRANSSEXUAL FROM PURCHASING.

962
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:45,697
COME ON.

963
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:47,699
OKAY, COME ON.

964
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,701
ALL RIGHT, I GOT TO GO.

965
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,703
SO GOOD LUCK AT THE PARTY, OKAY?

966
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:54,206
ROSS, COULD YOU JUST STAY AND HELP ME GET DRESSED?

967
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,209
SURE.

968
00:37:57,209 --> 00:37:58,710
OKAY.

969
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,711
OKAY, GREAT.

970
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:01,213
UM, OKAY, JUST...

971
00:38:01,213 --> 00:38:02,714
TURN AROUND.

972
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:03,715
WHAT?

973
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:06,218
I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE ME NAKED.

974
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:08,720
RACHEL, I'VE SEEN YOU NAKED A MILLION TIMES.

975
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,222
I ATE HOT FUDGE OFF YOU NAKED.

976
00:38:10,222 --> 00:38:12,224
REMEMBER I SUCKED THAT MINI MARSHMALLOW

977
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,725
OUT OF YOUR BELLY BUTTON?

978
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:16,228
YEAH, BUT THAT WAS DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW?

979
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:18,230
I MEAN, WE WERE GOING OUT THEN.

980
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,731
NOW I THINK IT'S WEIRD.

981
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,234
RACH, YOU KNOW, I CAN SEE YOU NAKED

982
00:38:22,234 --> 00:38:23,235
ANYTIME I WANT.

983
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:24,236
WHAT?

984
00:38:24,236 --> 00:38:25,237

985
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,739
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS CLOSE MY EYES.

986
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:30,742
SEE? WHOO HOO!

987
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:35,747
ROSS, STOP THAT!

988
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:37,249
COME ON.

989
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:39,751
I DON'T WANT YOU THINKING OF ME LIKE THAT ANYMORE.

990
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:41,753
UH, SORRY. NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

991
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:44,256
IT'S ONE OF MY RIGHTS AS THE EX BOYFRIEND.

992
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:46,758
HUH? UH... OH, YEAH.

993
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:47,759
STOP IT.

994
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:49,261
CUT IT OUT, CUT IT OUT!

995
00:38:49,261 --> 00:38:50,762
OKAY, OKAY, I'M SORRY.

996
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,764
IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN...

997
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:54,766
UH OH! WAIT A MINUTE! WAIT, WAIT...

998
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:58,770
NOW THERE ARE 100 OF YOU, AND I'M THE KING.

999
00:38:58,770 --> 00:38:59,771
ROSS...

1000
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:01,273
OH, COME ON.

1001
00:39:01,273 --> 00:39:02,774
WOULD YOU GROW UP?

1002
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:03,775
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

1003
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:06,278
ALL RIGHT.

1004
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:07,779
FINE.

1005
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,281
YOWSAH!!!

1006
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:10,282
OKAY!

1007
00:39:10,282 --> 00:39:11,783
SEE WHAT YOU DID?

1008
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:14,786
I'M GOING TO BE DOING IT BY MYSELF NOW.

1009
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:17,289
THAT'S IT. OW! OH! OW, OW!

1010
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:20,292
LOOK, LOOK, OKAY, RACH, EASY, EASY.

1011
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:23,295
YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL, OKAY?

1012
00:39:23,295 --> 00:39:25,297
OKAY, I DO. I REALLY DO.

1013
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:28,300
I'M GOING TO GET YOUR COAT, AND THEN I'LL PUT YOU IN A CAB.

1014
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,801
OH, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COME WITH ME?

1015
00:39:33,305 --> 00:39:34,806
OF COURSE I AM.

1016
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:37,809
I JUST HAVE TO MAKE A CALL.

1017
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,311
OKAY?

1018
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:40,312
THANK YOU.

1019
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:43,315

1020
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:46,318
OW! GAH...!

1021
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:47,319
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

1022
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:50,322
I'M SORRY. I JUST CAN'T GO TO THE HOSPITAL

1023
00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:52,324
LOOKING LIKE THIS.

1024
00:39:52,324 --> 00:39:53,825
DOES IT INVOLVE TRAVEL?

1025
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:54,826
NO!

1026
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:57,329
DOES IT INVOLVE CLOGS?

1027
00:39:57,329 --> 00:39:59,831
WAIT, WAIT. CLOGS OR CLAWS?

1028
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:01,333
CLOGS.

1029
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:01,833
NO.

1030
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:02,834
CLAWS?

1031
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:03,335
NO.

1032
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:08,840
OKAY, SO IT DOESN'T INVOLVE ROSS OR RACHEL

1033
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,342
OR CHANDLER OR JOEY.

1034
00:40:10,342 --> 00:40:11,843
WHAT ABOUT PETE?

1035
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:12,344
NO!

1036
00:40:12,344 --> 00:40:13,845
WHAT IS IT?!

1037
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:16,348
WHAT ABOUT PETE?

1038
00:40:16,348 --> 00:40:18,350
I DON'T KNOW.

1039
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:21,353
OKAY, I FEEL LIKE I'M TALKING TO LASSIE.

1040
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:25,857
GREAT. PHOEBE, WOULD YOU JUST TELL ME?

1041
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:26,858
I CAN'T!

1042
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,360
OKAY. I GOT TO GO.

1043
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,861
YOU'RE SO CLOSE. NO!

1044
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:31,863
DOES IT INVOLVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH PETE'S COMPUTER COMPANY?

1045
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,865
UGH! JUST GO! YOU'RE NEVER

1046
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:35,367
GOING TO GET IT.

1047
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,373

1048
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:44,876
I KNOW.

1049
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:48,880
SEE, YES, THAT'S YASMINE BLEETH.

1050
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,883
SHE'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT KIND OF CHICK.

1051
00:40:54,386 --> 00:40:56,888
I LOVE YOU BOTH...

1052
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:01,393
BUT IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS.

1053
00:41:01,393 --> 00:41:02,394
HEY.

1054
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:04,396
HEY.

1055
00:41:04,396 --> 00:41:05,897
OH, AH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1056
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:08,400
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE HER

1057
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,901
BACK TO THE STORE TODAY.

1058
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:12,404
I DID, BUT THE STORE WOULDN'T TAKE HER BACK

1059
00:41:12,404 --> 00:41:13,905
SO THEN I TOOK HER TO THE SHELTER

1060
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:15,907
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I FOUND OUT?

1061
00:41:20,412 --> 00:41:22,914
IF THEY CAN'T FIND A HOME FOR HER

1062
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,416
THEY KILL HER!

1063
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:26,918
AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN

1064
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:27,919
TO LITTLE YASMINE.

1065
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:29,921
OKAY, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD

1066
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:32,424
BECAUSE I WAS KIND OF  HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS, TOO.

1067
00:41:32,424 --> 00:41:33,925
OKAY.

1068
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:35,427
AND IT'S NOT JUST CHICKS, YOU KNOW.

1069
00:41:35,427 --> 00:41:37,429
IT'S ALL KINDS OF OTHER ANIMALS.

1070
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:38,430
THAT'S HORRIBLE!

1071
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,432
WELL, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING, MAN.

1072
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:42,934
THANKS. I'M GLAD YOU SEE IT THAT WAY.

1073
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,936

1074
00:41:54,446 --> 00:41:56,448
OH, FUNNY STORY.

1075
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,452
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!

1076
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:02,954
WOW, LOOK AT THIS REFRIGERATOR!

1077
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:04,956
IT'S GIGANTIC!

1078
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,458
I COULD LIVE IN THIS THING!

1079
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:08,460
I'D BE COLD, BUT I'M ALWAYS COLD.

1080
00:42:10,462 --> 00:42:12,464
OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT THESE SPIDER BURNERS!

1081
00:42:12,464 --> 00:42:13,965
I LOVE SPIDER BURNERS!

1082
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:15,467
SO YOU LIKE IT?

1083
00:42:15,467 --> 00:42:17,969
OH, IT IS SO PERFECT!

1084
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:19,471
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

1085
00:42:19,471 --> 00:42:21,473
YOU'RE WELCOME.

1086
00:42:21,473 --> 00:42:23,475

1087
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:29,481
DID YOU JUST SMELL MY HAIR?

1088
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:30,982
NO.

1089
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:32,984
NO WAY. WHAT? NO.

1090
00:42:32,984 --> 00:42:33,985
OH, GOD.

1091
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:35,987
WHAT?

1092
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:38,990
YOU STILL HAVE FEELINGS FOR ME, DON'T YOU?

1093
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,492
NO. NO.

1094
00:42:40,492 --> 00:42:42,994
I'M JUST EXCITED ABOUT THE RESTAURANT, THAT'S ALL.

1095
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:43,995
PETE...

1096
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:45,497
OKAY, I LOVE YOU.

1097
00:42:45,497 --> 00:42:46,998
IS THAT SO BAD?

1098
00:42:46,998 --> 00:42:47,999
NO, IT'S NOT BAD.

1099
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,001
IT'S NOT BAD AT ALL.

1100
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:52,003
IT'S... IT'S REALLY NICE.

1101
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:55,006
LOOK, THE ONLY ONE WHO STANDS TO GET HURT IS ME

1102
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:56,007
AND I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

1103
00:42:56,508 --> 00:42:59,010
YEAH, YOU MAY BE OKAY WITH GETTING HURT

1104
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:02,514
BUT I AM NOT OKAY WITH BEING THE ONE WHO HURTS YOU.

1105
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:06,017
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T TAKE THIS JOB.

1106
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:07,519
WHAT?

1107
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:12,023
WE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T SEE EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

1108
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:14,025
I'M SORRY.

1109
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:16,528
OKAY. YEAH.

1110
00:43:16,528 --> 00:43:20,532
I MEAN, IF THAT'S REALLY WHAT YOU WANT, OKAY.

1111
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:25,537
OKAY. BYE.

1112
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,043
I'M SORRY THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT...

1113
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:36,548
SHUT UP FOR A SECOND, AND LET ME JUST SEE SOMETHING.

1114
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:43,555
OH, WOW!

1115
00:43:49,561 --> 00:43:52,063
YOU'D TELL ME THE TRUTH, RIGHT?

1116
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:56,067
RACH, YOU CAN'T LOOK FAT IN AN X RAY.

1117
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:58,069
OKAY, NOW, YOU STAY OUT HERE

1118
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:00,572
AND YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DID!

1119
00:44:02,574 --> 00:44:04,576
THAT'S A DUCK.

1120
00:44:04,576 --> 00:44:06,077
THAT'S A BAD DUCK!

1121
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,582
HOW DID THE THING GO TONIGHT, ROSS?

1122
00:44:10,582 --> 00:44:13,084
UH, IT WAS... NAH, WELL...

1123
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:14,586
WHAT THING? WHAT THING?

1124
00:44:14,586 --> 00:44:16,087
NOTHING. THERE WAS THIS THING AT THE MUSEUM.

1125
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:17,088
COME ON.

1126
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:18,590
EASY.

1127
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:21,092
OKAY

1128
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:23,595
NOW, WHEN YOU COME BACK, I HOPE YOU REMEMBER

1129
00:44:23,595 --> 00:44:25,096
THAT THAT CHICK IS NOT A TOY!

1130
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,602
WHAT THING? WHAT IS THIS THING?

1131
00:44:30,602 --> 00:44:34,105
UH, I WAS KIND OF SUPPOSED TO BE ON TV TONIGHT

1132
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:36,107
FOR THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL.

1133
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:37,609
OH, MY GOD!

1134
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:40,111
ROSS, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT?

1135
00:44:40,612 --> 00:44:42,614
AH, BECAUSE I KNEW THAT IF I TOLD YOU

1136
00:44:42,614 --> 00:44:44,115
YOU'D MAKE ME GO, AND I KNEW

1137
00:44:44,616 --> 00:44:46,117
YOU NEEDED SOMEONE TO BE WITH YOU TONIGHT.

1138
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:47,619
COME ON.

1139
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:48,620
COME ON.

1140
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,121
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU.

1141
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:51,122
WHAT?

1142
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:53,124
THAT IS THE SWEETEST THING.

1143
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:56,127
I JUST...

1144
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:05,637
YOU SHOULD GET SOME SLEEP.

1145
00:45:05,637 --> 00:45:08,139
OKAY.

1146
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:10,642
I'M SORRY I SPOILED YOUR EVENING.

1147
00:45:10,642 --> 00:45:12,644
NO. AS LONG AS YOU'RE OKAY.

1148
00:45:12,644 --> 00:45:13,645
OH, YEAH.

1149
00:45:13,645 --> 00:45:14,646
SO, I'LL, UH...

1150
00:45:14,646 --> 00:45:16,147
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

1151
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:17,649
MM HMM. YEAH.

1152
00:45:24,656 --> 00:45:26,658
SEE YOU.

1153
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,672
WHAT DID YOU DO?

1154
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:50,682

1155
00:45:50,682 --> 00:45:52,183
WHAT YOU DOING?

1156
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:54,185
HAVING A SWIM.

1157
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:56,688
WHAT ABOUT THE CHICK?

1158
00:45:56,688 --> 00:45:58,690
CHICKS DON'T SWIM.

1159
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,191
ARE YOU SURE?

1160
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:03,695
I DON'T KNOW.

1161
00:46:04,696 --> 00:46:06,197
SHOULD WE TRY?

1162
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:07,699
SURE.

1163
00:46:14,706 --> 00:46:17,709
SEE? I TOLD YOU-- THEY DON'T SWIM.

1164
00:46:17,709 --> 00:46:19,711
WAIT. WAIT. GIVE HIM A MINUTE.

1165
00:46:19,711 --> 00:46:25,717
NO! OH, IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY. PEEP PEEP PEEP.
