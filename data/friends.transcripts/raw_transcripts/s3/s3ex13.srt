1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,004
HI.

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,007
SIX DOLLARS, PLEASE.

3
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,009
SIX? I JUST HAD IT FOR ONE NIGHT.

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,010
IT'S THREE.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,012
8 OCLOCK is THE CUTOFF

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,014
AND... OH, IT'S 8 0 2.

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
YOU KNOW, IN A WEIRD WAY, YOU HAVE TOO MUCH POWER.

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,520
LOOK, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HELP ME OUT HERE

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,022
BECAUSE I ONLY HAVE THREE.

10
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,523
I CAN HELP WITH THAT.

11
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,027
OH, MY GOD.

12
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,528
RICHARD?

13
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,030
HI.

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,531
HI.

15
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,533
WOW, YOUR LIP WENT BALD.

16
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,038
HEY, THANKS.

17
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,540
SO... YOU LOOK GREAT.

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,542
YEAH, RIGHT.

19
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,543
NO, YOU DO.

20
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,545
YOU... YOU JUST...

21
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,047
WHAT?

22
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,549
YOU GOT PANTIES STUCK TO YOUR LEG.

23
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,555
THAT'S BECAUSE I WAS JUST GRABBING SOME THINGS

24
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,058
OUT OF THE DRYER, AND STATIC CLING.

25
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,560
OR MAYBE IT'S JUST BECAUSE GOD KNEW

26
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,563
I'D BE RUNNING INTO YOU AND SAW AN OPPORTUNITY.

27
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,565
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

28
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,567
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.

29
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:22,582
?  ?

30
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,584
?  ?

31
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,587
?  ?

32
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:31,091
?  ?

33
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,593
?  ?

34
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,097
?  ?

35
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:41,101
?  ?

36
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,103
?  ?

37
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,106
?  ?

38
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,108
?  ?

39
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,610
?  ?

40
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,614
?  ?

41
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,618

42
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,120
THAT GUY'S IN CLASSICS NOW

43
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,122
BUT YOU KNOW, AS SOON AS WE LEAVE

44
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,124
HE'S GOING STRAIGHT TO THE PORN.

45
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,626
HE'S GOING TO GO UP TO THE COUNTER

46
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:10,130
WITH CITIZEN KANE, VERTIGO AND CLOCKWORK ORGY.

47
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,135
THIS IS NICE.

48
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,137
I MISS THIS.

49
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,138
YEAH.

50
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,639
EXCUSE ME.

51
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,141
WE'RE GOING BE HERE FOR A WHILE

52
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,642
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO BACK THERE.

53
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,144
YEAH. WE'RE NOT JUDGING.

54
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,651
SO YOU WANT TO GET A HAMBURGER OR SOMETHING?

55
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,154
OH, UM... I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

56
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,655
LOOK, JUST FRIENDS.

57
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,657
I WON'T GROPE YOU, I PROMISE.

58
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,160
NO, I THINK IT'S TOO SOON.

59
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,162
NO, IT'S NOT TOO SOON.

60
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,164
I HAD LUNCH AT 11:00.

61
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,667
YEAH, BABY.

62
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,169
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

63
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,670
MAKING CHOCOLATE MILK.

64
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,172
YOU WANT SOME?

65
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,174
NO, THANKS. I'M 29.

66
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,177
OH, MY GOD, I GOT TO GO TO WORK.

67
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,180
OH, SWEETIE, WHAT TIME DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET OFF TONIGHT?

68
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,182
OH, I DON'T KNOW, HONEY, IT COULD BE REALLY LATE.

69
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,183
OH, COME ON, NOT AGAIN.

70
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,184
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

71
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,186
I'LL MAKE A DEAL WITH YOU, OKAY?

72
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,188
FOR EVERY NIGHT THAT YOU'RE ASLEEP

73
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,190
BEFORE I GET HOME FROM WORK

74
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,691
I WILL WAKE YOU UP IN A WAY

75
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,194
THAT HAS PROVED VERY POPULAR IN THE PAST.

76
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,696
WELL, NOW, IF YOU NEED TO STAY LATE

77
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,698
I WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT.

78
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,200
HI.

79
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,201
HEY.

80
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,702
LOOK AT YOU.

81
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,204
SINCE WHEN DO YOU ROLLERBLADE?

82
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,705
OH, SINCE TOMORROW.

83
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,707
I MET THIS REALLY CUTE GUY IN THE PARK.

84
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,710
AND HE, LIKE, YOU KNOW, JOGS AND BLADES AND SWIMS

85
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,711
AND SO WE MADE A DEAL.

86
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,215
HE'S GOING TO TEACH ME HOW TO DO ALL SORTS OF JOCK STUFF.

87
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,718
AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO FOR HIM?

88
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,220
I'M GOING TO LET HIM.

89
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,221
OKAY.

90
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,722
MORNING.

91
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,725
HEY, SOMEBODY GOT IN LATE LAST NIGHT.

92
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,728
WELL, I RAN INTO RICHARD.

93
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,730
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

94
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,232
OH, AROUND 8:02.

95
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,734
WE, UH, TALKED FOR A LITTLE WHILE

96
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,738
AND THEN WE WENT OUT FOR AN INNOCENT BURGER.

97
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,241
OH, THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS AN INNOCENT BURGER.

98
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,742
ARE YOU GOING TO SEE HIM AGAIN?

99
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,244
TOMORROW NIGHT.

100
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,246
MONICA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

101
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,748
WELL, SHE SPENT THE LAST SIX MONTHS

102
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,250
GETTING OVER HIM

103
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,252
AND NOW SHE'S CELEBRATING THAT

104
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,254
BY GOING ON A DATE WITH HIM.

105
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,255
IT'S NOT A DATE, OKAY?

106
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,758
I'M JUST GOING TO TEACH HIM HOW TO MAKE A LASAGNA

107
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,260
FOR SOME POTLUCK DINNER HE HAS.

108
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,262
YOU MIGHT WANT TO MAKE A LITTLE EXTRA

109
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,764
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU'LL PROBABLY BE HUNGRY

110
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,766
AFTER THE SEX.

111
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,268
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE SEX.

112
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,269
OKAY, NOTHING'S CHANGED HERE.

113
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,271
HE STILL DOESN'T WANT CHILDREN

114
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,272
AND I STILL DO.

115
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,275
SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO JUST BE FRIENDS.

116
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,277
NAKED FRIENDS.

117
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,282
HEY. HEY.

118
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,283
DO YOU HAVE ANY ICE?

119
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,784
CHECK THE FREEZER.

120
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,786
IF THERE'S NONE IN THERE, WE'RE PROBABLY OUT.

121
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,788
ARE YOU JUST GETTING HOME FROM WORK?

122
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,789
IT'S LATE.

123
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,790
YEAH, I KNOW.

124
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,792
I HAD THE GREATEST DAY THOUGH.

125
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,294
I GOT TO SIT IN ON A MEETING

126
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,296
WITH THE REPS FROM CALVIN KLEIN.

127
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,298
I TOLD MY BOSS I LIKED THIS LINE OF LINGERIE.

128
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,799
SHE ORDERED A TON OF IT.

129
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,800
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

130
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,803
I DISCOVERED I'M ABLE TO COUNT ALL MY TEETH

131
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,804
USING JUST MY TONGUE.

132
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,808
HMM.

133
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:13,813
UM, WHY DO YOU HAVE A COPY OF THE SHINING IN YOUR FREEZER?

134
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,816
OH, I WAS READING IT LAST NIGHT

135
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,818
AND I GOT SCARED, SO...

136
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,821
BUT YOU'RE SAFE FROM IT IF IT'S IN THE FREEZER?

137
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,323
WELL, SAFER.

138
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,825
YOU KNOW, I NEVER START READING THE SHINING

139
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,327
WITHOUT MAKING SURE

140
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,329
WE GOT PLENTY OF ROOM IN THE FREEZER, YOU KNOW?

141
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,332
HOW OFTEN DO YOU READ IT?

142
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,833
HAVEN'T YOU EVER READ THE SAME BOOK

143
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,834
OVER AND OVER AGAIN?

144
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,336
WELL, UM, I GUESS I READ

145
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,837
LITTLE WOMEN MORE THAN ONCE.

146
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,339
BUT IT'S A CLASSIC.

147
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,840
WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT THE SHINING?

148
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,342
THE QUESTION SHOULD BE, RACH

149
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,344
WHAT IS NOT SO GREAT ABOUT THE SHINING?

150
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,346
OKAY?

151
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,847
AND THE ANSWER WOULD BE "NOTHING."

152
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,349
ALL RIGHT?

153
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,351
THIS IS, LIKE, THE SCARIEST BOOK EVER.

154
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,354
I BET IT'S WAY BETTER THAN THAT "CLASSIC" OF YOURS.

155
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,855
OKAY.

156
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,358
WELL, WE'LL JUST SEE ABOUT THAT, OKAY?

157
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,360
I WILL READ THE SHINING

158
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,364
AND YOU WILL READ LITTLE WOMEN.

159
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,865
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT IT.

160
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,367
ALL RIGHT?

161
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,868
OKAY.

162
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,870
NOW, RACH, THESE LITTLE WOMEN...

163
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,372
YEAH?

164
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,873
HOW LITTLE ARE THEY?

165
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,377
I MEAN, ARE THEY, LIKE, SCARY LITTLE?

166
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,885
YOU KNOW, I LOVE THIS FABRIC.

167
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,889
I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE A SUIT MADE OUT OF THIS.

168
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,894
CHANDLER, ROSS, THIS IS ROBERT.

169
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,396
OH, HEY. HEY.

170
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,897
YOU HAVE LIPSTICK RIGHT HERE.

171
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,899
THAT'S OKAY. IT'S MINE.

172
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,401
WE JUST KISSED.

173
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,402
OH.

174
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,403
SO ISN'T IT

175
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,905
A BIT COLD OUT FOR SHORTS?

176
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,408
WELL, I'M FROM CALIFORNIA.

177
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,911
RIGHT, RIGHT, SOMETIMES YOU GUYS JUST BURST INTO FLAME.

178
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,423
I'M UP...

179
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,924
I'M UP.

180
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:05,925
I'VE GOTTEN UP NOW.

181
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,427
ANYBODY WANT ANYTHING?

182
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,428
I'LL HAVE COFFEE.

183
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,429
YEAH, ME, TOO.

184
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,930
 MAKE THAT THREE.

185
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,933
OKAY. ROSS, WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME?

186
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,437
OKAY.

187
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,439
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

188
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,940
WHAT'S GOING ON?

189
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,941
ROBERT'S COMING OUT.

190
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,943
WHAT... WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

191
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,445
WHAT, IS HE GAY?

192
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,947
NO, HE...

193
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,952
HE'S COMING OUT OF HIS SHORTS.

194
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,957
WHAT?

195
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,959
THE MAN IS SHOWING BRAIN.

196
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,965
ARE YOU SURE?

197
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,467
HOLD ON.

198
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,470
I'M SORRY, YOU GUYS, THAT WAS A COFFEE AND A...?

199
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,971
COFFEE.

200
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,973
WE COULD WRITE IT DOWN FOR YOU.

201
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,476
NO, THAT WON'T BE, UH... WON'T BE NECESSARY.

202
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,977

203
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,983
WELL?

204
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,985
YEP, YEP, YEP.

205
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,987
WHAT DO WE DO? WHAT DO WE DO?

206
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:08,988
WELL, I SUPPOSE

207
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,492
WE JUST TRY TO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT IT.

208
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,497
LIKE AN ECLIPSE.

209
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,503
SO WHEN PEOPLE COMPLIMENT ME ON MY COOKING TONIGHT

210
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,004
WHAT DO I SAY?

211
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,006
YOU SAY, "THANK YOU VERY MUCH."

212
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,509
AND THEN YOU BUY ME SOMETHING PRETTY.

213
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,011
COME ON, WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUR HANDS IN THIS BOWL

214
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,014
AND WE'RE GOING TO START SQUISHING THE TOMATOES.

215
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,517
OH, THIS FEELS VERY WEIRD.

216
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,019
YOU TOUCH PEOPLE'S EYEBALLS EVERY DAY

217
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,020
AND THIS FEELS WEIRD?

218
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,522
YEAH, WELL, SURE, I TOUCH THEM

219
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,526
BUT I SPENT YEARS LEARNING NOT TO SQUISH THEM.

220
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,033
THAT'S MY HAND.

221
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,035
OH.

222
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,036
OKAY.

223
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,538
GOT TO KEEP SQUISHING.

224
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,039
THE TOMATOES ARE SQUISHING.

225
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,041
OH.

226
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,543
OH, GOSH

227
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,545
YOU GOT SOME ON YOUR SHIRT.

228
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,046
HOLD ON A SEC.

229
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,049
OKAY, WE JUST PUT A LITTLE CLUB SODA ON IT.

230
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,551
IF WE GET TO IT RIGHT AWAY

231
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,554
IT SHOULD... DO...

232
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,056
THE TRICK.

233
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,066
WHAT?

234
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,069
UM, YOU'VE GOT SOME ON YOUR PANTS.

235
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,576
I'LL JUST THROW THEM OUT.

236
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,583
THESE LITTLE WOMEN...

237
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,585
WOW!

238
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,087
YOU'RE LIKING IT, HUH?

239
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,088
OH, YEAH.

240
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,090
AMY JUST BURNED JO's MANUSCRIPT.

241
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,093
I DON'T SEE HOW HE COULD EVER FORGIVE HER.

242
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,097
UM, JO's A GIRL.

243
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,099
IT'S SHORT FOR JOSEPHINE.

244
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,602
BUT JO's GOT A CRUSH ON LAURIE.

245
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,607
OH.

246
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,610
YOU MEAN IT'S, LIKE, A GIRL GIRL THING?

247
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,113
BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONE THING MISSING FROM THE SHINING.

248
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,118
NO, ACTUALLY, LAURIE'S A BOY.

249
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:23,623
NO WONDER RACHEL HAD TO READ THIS SO MANY TIMES.

250
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,626
HEY.

251
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,627
HEY.

252
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,629
HEY, HOW'D THE BASKETBALL GO?

253
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,632
OH, OKAY, I LEARNED HOW TO SHOOT A LAYUP

254
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,634
A FOUL SHOT AND A 23 POINTER.

255
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,135
YOU MEAN A THREE POINTER?

256
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,137
I GET MORE BECAUSE I'M DAINTY.

257
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,641
SO IS THERE A PHONE HERE I CAN CHECK MY MESSAGES?

258
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,642
YEAH, IN THE BACK.

259
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,143
DO YOU WANT A QUARTER?

260
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,645
OH, NO, THANKS.

261
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,146
I ALWAYS CARRY ONE IN MY SOCK.

262
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,660
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

263
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,662
GET BACK OVER ON YOUR SIDE OF THE...

264
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,664
HELLO!

265
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,668
HI. I'M JOEY.

266
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,670
WE HAVEN'T MET.

267
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,672
GOOD TO MEET YOU. ROBERT.

268
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,173
OKAY...

269
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,175

270
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,177
WHAT?

271
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,179
WHAT, YOU GUYS?

272
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,181
WHAT IS GOING ON?

273
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,683
DO YOU NOT LIKE ROBERT?

274
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,185
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

275
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,186
CALM DOWN.

276
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,688
THERE'S NO REASON

277
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,189
TO GET TESTY.

278
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,191

279
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,695
YOU GUYS, COME ON.

280
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,696
WE'RE SORRY.

281
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,197
WE'RE SORRY.

282
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,200
IT JUST SEEMS THAT ROBERT ISN'T AS CONCEALED

283
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,702
IN THE SHORTS AREA

284
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,704
AS, UH... ONE MAY HAVE HOPED.

285
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,206
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

286
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,708
HEY.

287
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,209
HEY.

288
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,712
UH, ROBERT, COULD YOU, UH...

289
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,214
UH, PASS ME THOSE COOKIES?

290
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,215
SURE.

291
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,722
BALL?

292
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,723
YEAH.

293
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,230
SO HOW DID THE LASAGNA GO OVER?

294
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,232
REALLY?

295
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,734
GOOD.

296
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,736
SO YOU OWE ME THREE PRETTY THINGS.

297
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,239
YEAH. I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT YOU, TOO.

298
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,241
I KNOW.

299
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,244
IT'S HARD, THIS PLATONOMY THING.

300
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,746
IT'S A WORD.

301
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,748

302
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,249
YEAH.

303
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,752
I DO THINK IT'S BETTER THIS WAY.

304
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,754
YEAH, WE'RE BEING SMART.

305
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,255
YES, I'M SURE.

306
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,761
YOU'RE REALLY SURE?

307
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,763
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

308
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,777
SO WE CAN BE FRIENDS WHO SLEEP TOGETHER.

309
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,278
ABSOLUTELY.

310
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,781
THIS WILL JUST BE SOMETHING WE DO

311
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,784
LIKE... RACQUETBALL.

312
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,787
YEAH. SOUNDS SMART AND HEALTHY TO ME.

313
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:12,792
SO, UM... JUST OUT OF, UH, CURIOSITY

314
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,794
UM, DO YOU CURRENTLY

315
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,296
HAVE ANY OTHER RACQUETBALL BUDDIES?

316
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,298
JUST YOUR DAD.

317
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,804
ALTHOUGH THAT'S ACTUALLY RACQUETBALL.

318
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,806
YOU KNOW, I I DO HAVE...

319
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,809
A BLIND DATE WITH MY SISTER'S NEIGHBOR

320
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,811
NEXT... TUESDAY.

321
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,812
OH.

322
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,815
YOU WANT ME TO CANCEL IT?

323
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,316
NO.

324
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,818

325
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,319
NO.

326
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,320
OKAY.

327
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,822
BECAUSE IF YOU DID

328
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,825
THAT MEANS YOU'D BE CANCELING FOR ME...

329
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,827
AND WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

330
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,829
EXACTLY.

331
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,330
AND BESIDES, YOU KNOW WHAT?

332
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,832
IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR ANYWAY

333
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,335
BECAUSE MY MOTHER'S TRYING TO SET ME UP WITH SOME LAWYER.

334
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,837
SO WHO'S THIS LAWYER?

335
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,839
OH, NO, SHE DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE ONE

336
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,841
BUT SHE'S LOOKING.

337
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,844
HEY.

338
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,345
OH, DON'T SIT DOWN.

339
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,347
READY TO GO TO THE BATTING CAGE?

340
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,350
YEAH, YOU BET, AND FIRST, HERE'S A GIFT.

341
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,852
OH.

342
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,353
WOW!

343
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,855
HEY...

344
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,857
STRETCHY PANTS!

345
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,359
THOSE ARE THE GREATEST THINGS IN THE WORLD.

346
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,362
IF I WERE YOU, I'D WEAR THEM EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY.

347
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,866
GEEZ, THANK YOU.

348
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,367
REALLY, THAT'S SO NICE

349
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,369
BUT, UM, TO BE HONEST

350
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,371
I DON'T THINK I CAN WEAR THESE--

351
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,372
THEY'RE SO TIGHT.

352
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,875
I'D FEEL LIKE I'M ON DISPLAY.

353
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,878
I'M SORRY.

354
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,379
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

355
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,881
I'LL... FIGURES.

356
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,383
HEY!

357
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,885
HI.

358
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,386
HOW'S IT GOING?

359
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,888
HEY, RACH... GOOD.

360
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,890
HOW ARE YOU DOING WITH THE SHINING?

361
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,392
OH, DANNY JUST WENT INTO ROOM 217.

362
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,394
OOH... THE NEXT PART'S THE BEST

363
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,396
WHEN THAT DEAD LADY IN THE BATHTUB...

364
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,899
OH, NO, NO, NO! COME ON, YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN IT.

365
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,901
ALL RIGHT. I'LL TALK IN CODE.

366
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,402
REMEMBER...

367
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,405
WHEN THE KID SEES THOSE TWO BLANKS IN THE HALLWAY?

368
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,908
YEAH. THAT'S VERY COOL.

369
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,910
OH! ALL BLANK AND NO BLANK

370
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,412
MAKES BLANK A BLANK BLANK.

371
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,916
NO, NO, NO. NO, THE END--

372
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,418
WHEN JACK ALMOST KILLS THEM ALL WITH THAT BLANK

373
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,420
BUT THEN, IN THE LAST SECOND, THEY GET AWAY.

374
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,922
OH! OH, OH!

375
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,424
JOEY, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU JUST DID THAT.

376
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,427
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE CRACKED YOUR CODE.

377
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,432
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

378
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,935
LAURIE PROPOSES TO JOE, AND SHE SAYS NO

379
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,437
EVEN THOUGH SHE'S STILL IN LOVE WITH HIM

380
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,439
AND THEN HE ENDS UP MARRYING AMY.

381
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,443
HEY!

382
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,946
MINE WAS BY ACCIDENT!

383
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,948
ALL RIGHT. THE BOILER EXPLODES

384
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,449
AND DESTROYS THE HOTEL

385
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,951
AND KILLS THE DAD.

386
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,452

387
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,954
BETH DIES.

388
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,956

389
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,464
BETH...

390
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,966
BETH DIES?

391
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,967
MM HMM.

392
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,968
IS THAT TRUE?

393
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,971
IF I KEEP READING, IS BETH GOING TO DIE?

394
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,472
NO, BETH DOESN'T DIE.

395
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,473
SHE DOESN'T DIE.

396
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,474
DOES SHE, RACHEL?

397
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,976
WHAT?!

398
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,478
JOEY'S ASKING IF YOU'VE JUST RUINED

399
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,480
THE FIRST BOOK HE'S EVER LOVED

400
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,482
THAT DIDN'T STAR JACK NICHOLSON.

401
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,485
NO.

402
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,487
SHE DOESN'T DIE.

403
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,489
THEN WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

404
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,995
BECAUSE...

405
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,497
I WANTED TO HURT YOU.

406
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,000
OH, THERE THEY ARE.

407
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,501
I I DROPPED MY KEYS.

408
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,003

409
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,004
OH, MY!

410
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,505
GOT THEM.

411
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,012
HI. AAH!

412
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,513
SORRY.

413
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,015
I'M SORRY.

414
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,517
YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE MY DAY.

415
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,020
I HAD TO WORK TWO SHIFTS

416
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,521
AND THEN, TO TOP IT OFF

417
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,024
I LOST ONE OF MY FAKE BOOBS...

418
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,026
IN A GRILL FIRE.

419
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,029
WHAT ARE YOU SMILING AT?

420
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,031
I'M SORRY, I WAS JUST THINKING

421
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,033
YOUR DAY COULD STILL PICK UP.

422
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,036
YEAH, RIGHT.

423
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,041
HELLO.

424
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,543
I LOVE THIS FRIEND THING!

425
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,053
LISTEN, ROBERT'S GOING TO BE HERE ANY SECOND.

426
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,055
SO COULD ONE OF YOU JUST TELL HIM?

427
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,556
PLEASE. RIGHT NOW...

428
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,058
NO, EVERY TIME I SEE HIM

429
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,559
IT'S LIKE, "IS IT ON THE LOOSE?

430
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,560
IS IT WATCHING ME?"

431
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,562
LOOK, WE CAN'T TELL HIM.

432
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,065
YOU CAN'T GO UP TO A GUY YOU BARELY KNOW

433
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,067
AND TALK ABOUT HIS...

434
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,568
STUFF.

435
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,070
HE'S RIGHT--

436
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,573
EVEN IF IT'S TO SAY SOMETHING COMPLIMENTARY.

437
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,078
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL HIM?

438
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,579
YOU'RE GOING OUT WITH HIM.

439
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,081
OH, WAY TOO AWKWARD.

440
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,584
NO. I HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN IT WITH PERMISSION YET. NO.

441
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,586
I MEAN, SO WHAT... WHAT DO I DO?

442
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,588
JUST, YOU KNOW, BREAK UP WITH HIM?

443
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,090
I DON'T KNOW.

444
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,092
I THINK THIS IS AN UNSOLVABLE PROBLEM.

445
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,094
IT'S ACURIAT MARIAH.

446
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,098
THE UNSOLVABLE PROBLEM THEY GAVE TO CAPTAIN KIRK

447
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,101
AS PART OF HIS TRAINING TO BE A STARFLEET COMMANDER.

448
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,602
YOU MEAN YASHI MARU.

449
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,604
WHAT'S ACURIAT MARIAH?

450
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,107
THE PLACE WITH THE CHEAP ROOMS

451
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,109
WHERE WE STAYED IN ISRAEL.

452
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,110
HEY.

453
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,111
HEY.

454
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,112
SO, YOU READY FOR THE GYM?

455
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,114
THEY GOT THIS NEW ROCK CLIMBING WALL.

456
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,615
WE CAN SPOT EACH OTHER.

457
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,620
YOU KNOW, I CAN SPOT YOU FROM HERE.

458
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,124
WHAT?

459
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,625
OKAY.

460
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,627
LISTEN, ROBERT...

461
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,629
HEY, DON'T WE HAVE TO...?

462
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,631
YEAH, WE GOT... YEAH. MM HMM.

463
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,137
UM...

464
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,138

465
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,640
I THINK YOU'RE REALLY, REALLY GREAT.

466
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,641
OH, GOD.

467
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,143
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

468
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,146
WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING TO ME?

469
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,648
IS IT SOMETHING I'M PUTTING OUT THERE?

470
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,152
IS THIS MY FAULT?

471
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,154
OR AM I JUST NUTS?

472
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,158
I... I I I I DON'T KNOW...

473
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,160
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

474
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,663
HEY, BUDDY, THIS IS A FAMILY PLACE.

475
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,166
PUT THE MOUSE BACK IN THE HOUSE.

476
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,169
OH...

477
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,682

478
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,190
 REALLY?

479
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,692
IT'S JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE'S APARTMENT.

480
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,195
IT'S GOT ROOMS AND WALLS AND CEILINGS.

481
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,197
 I WANTED TO SEE WHERE YOU LIVE.

482
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,198
NOW, GIVE ME THE TOUR.

483
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,199
OH, MY GOD.

484
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,200
OH, MY GOD!

485
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,202
THIS IS THE LIVING ROOM...

486
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,203
THAT'S NICE.

487
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,704
ALL RIGHT.

488
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,206
AND THIS IS THE KITCHEN.

489
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,207
THAT'S REAL PRETTY.

490
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,208
WAIT A MINUTE.

491
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,210
DON'T I GET TO SEE THE BEDROOM?

492
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,211
THE BEDROOM...

493
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,212

494
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,713
OH, IT'S PRETTY MUCH

495
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,215
YOUR TYPICAL...

496
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,216
BEDROOM.

497
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,718
WE'RE STILL ON THIS SIDE OF THE DOOR.

498
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,719
MM HMM.

499
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,221
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T GET TO SEE IT.

500
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,222
OH, SHOOT.

501
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,723
MAYBE NEXT TIME.

502
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,724

503
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,226
THANKS FOR A LOVELY EVENING.

504
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,745
SO, UM, WHO IS SHE?

505
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,748
OH. THAT WAS THE BLIND DATE THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

506
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,251
SHE CALLED AND SWITCHED IT FROM TUESDAY.

507
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,253
OH.

508
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,255
DID YOU LIKE HER?

509
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,757
AND I'M JUST ASKING AS A FRIEND

510
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,760
BECAUSE I AM TOTALLY FINE WITH THIS.

511
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,265
WELL, YOU SEEM FINE.

512
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,766
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

513
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,268
I I'M NOT FINE.

514
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,269
I'M NOT.

515
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,271
HOW CAN I BE FINE?

516
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,273
HEARING YOU COME IN WITH HER...

517
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,775
SHE WANTS TO SEE YOUR BEDROOM...

518
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,277

519
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,784
YOU KNOW WHAT?

520
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,789
WHAT IF WE'RE FRIENDS...

521
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,292
WHO DON'T SEE OTHER PEOPLE?

522
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,795
YOU MEAN, LIKE EXCLUSIVE FRIENDS?

523
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,298
WHY NOT? HMM?

524
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,302
I MEAN, THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST AMAZING WEEK.

525
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,805
I MEAN, WOULD IT BE SO TERRIBLE?

526
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,808
EVEN IF WE WERE FRIENDS WHO...

527
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,311
WHO LIVED TOGETHER.

528
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,813
OR... MAYBE, SOMEDAY

529
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,315
FRIENDS WHO...

530
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,318
WHO STOOD UP IN FRONT OF THEIR OTHER FRIENDS

531
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,820
AND VOWED TO BE FRIENDS FOREVER.

532
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,325
WOW.

533
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:12,331
DO YOU KNOW WE'RE BACK WHERE WE WERE?

534
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:16,335
HONEY, I WOULD LOVE TO DO ALL THAT

535
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,836
BUT NOTHING'S CHANGED.

536
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,838
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

537
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,340
YOU DON'T HAVE A MUSTACHE.

538
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,841

539
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,343
OKAY, OKAY.

540
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,344
ONE THING'S CHANGED.

541
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,846
BUT WE STILL WANT DIFFERENT THINGS

542
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,349
AND WE KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING TO END.

543
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,351
YOU KNOW WHAT?

544
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:36,355
I GOT TO WALK OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW...

545
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,358
BECAUSE GETTING OVER YOU IS THE HARDEST THING

546
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,360
THAT I HAVE EVER HAD TO DO.

547
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,364
UM... I DON'T THINK I COULD DO IT AGAIN.

548
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,366
I KNOW I COULDN'T.

549
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,869
YEAH.

550
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,873
SO...

551
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,885
HOW ABOUT ONE LAST GAME OF RACQUETBALL, HMM?

552
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,392
WATCH THE THORNS.

553
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,393
OW!

554
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,400
WHAT?

555
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,904
BETH IS REALLY, REALLY SICK.

556
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,406
OH...

557
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,907
