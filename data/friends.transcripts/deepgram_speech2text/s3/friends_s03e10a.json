Why? Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing? Rachel? Yeah. You remember when you first came here, how you spent 2 weeks Being trained by another waitress. Oh, sure. Do you need me to train somebody new? Good one. Actually, Terry wants you to take the training again whenever. Do you believe that? Yeah. So that's 2 boxes of the macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you. Just a minute, Shanley. You have no backhand. Excuse me, little one. I have a very solid backhand. Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl is not a backhand. I was shrieking like a marine. Right here. Watch me execute the 3 p's of championship play. Power, Precision, shoot, and panache. You broke a little girl's leg. I know. I feel horrible. Okay? Says here that a Muppet got whacked on Sesame Street last night. Where exactly were you around 10 ish? I'm gonna go see her. I wanna bring her something. What do you think she'd like? Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk. I'm gonna get back to retraining. Alright. See you guys. Look out, kids. He's coming. Then I gotta go sell some Christmas trees. Have fun. Oh, wait. No. Don't. I forgot. I am totally against that now. What? Me having a job? No. No. I am against Innocent trees being cut down in their prime and their their corpses grotesquely dressed in, like, tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey. How do you sleep at night? Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around. Hey. Phoebe, listen. You got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees. They're fulfilling their life purpose by by making people happy. Really? Yes. Yes. And, the trees are happy Because for most of them, it's their only chance to see New York. And after you've delivered the drinks, You take the empty tray Gunther. Gunther, please. I have worked here for two and a half years. I know the empty trays go over there. What if you put them here? Well, you know, that's actually a really good idea because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. You know what? You should have the other waitresses do that too. They already do. That's why they call it the tray spot. Jeez. I always heard him talk about that. I sorta just thought it was like a club they went to. Oh, god. I'm I'm sorry. It's alright, Sweetheart. So this must be Kinda neat for you. I mean, your dad tells me you get a couple of days off school, and you, you don't have to sell those cookies anymore. Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells most wins a trip to space camp and gets to sit in a real space shuttle. Wow. You, you really like all this space stuff. Yeah. My dad says if I spend as much time Clean apartments as I do daydream about outer space. He'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal. I think you'd have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all way to India. No. The one in Atlantic City. Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my grandma left me. Well, good luck to dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win? The girl who won last year sold 475. Yeah? So far, I've sold 75. 400. Well, that sounds doable. How much are the boxes? $5 a box. And what is second prize? A 10 speed bike, but I'd rather have something my dad couldn't sell. Will that make sense? Won't you do me one favor? If it's not too much trouble. Yeah. Sarah, anything. Could you pull out the curtains open for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news. And since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up through a window so I can watch it. Yes? Yeah. Hi. I'm selling brown bird cookies. You're no brown bird. I can see you through my peephole. No. Hi. I I'm an honorary brown bird. What does that mean? Well, it means that I can Sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleepovers. I can dial 9 one one at the press of a button, you know. Now go away. Please. Please. It's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Space camp more than anything in the world. I'm pressing. A policeman is on his way. Okay. Okay. I'm going. I'm going. I can still see you. Alright. Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? Well, I I thought a lot about what you said, and, I realized, maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah. Oh, but, oh. Okay. Remember, hey. They're just fulfilling their Christmas Destiny. Sure. Yes. Okay. Yikes. That one doesn't look very fulfilled. Oh, that's, that's one of the old ones. He's just taken it to the back. You keep the old ones in the back? That is so ageist. But we have to make room for the fresh ones. So what happens to the old guys? Look. They go into the chipper. Well, I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds. And these come in the shapes of your favorite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and baby Jesus. Alright. I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesuses. Wait a minute. 1 box? Come on. I'm trying to send a poor little girl to space camp. I'm putting you down for 5 boxes. Chandler, what about you? Alright. Do you have any, coconut flavored deities? No. But, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menorios. I'll tell you what. I'll put you down for 8 boxes, 1 for each night. Ma'am? Alright. I'll take 1 box of the mint treasures. 1, and that's it. I started gaining weight after I joined the brown birds. Remember? Dad bought every 1 of my boxes, and I ate them all. I know, man. Dad had to buy every 1 of your boxes because you ate them But, you know, I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time. Why don't I just put you down for 3 of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolphs? No. Oh, come on now. You know you want them. Don't don't don't don't do this. I'll tell you what, ma. I'll give you the 1st box for free. Oh, god. I gotta go. Come on. All the cool kids are eating them. And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there. I'm training to be better at a job that I hate. My life officially sucks. But, Rach, wasn't it supposed to be a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff. Well, yeah. I'm still pursuing that. How exactly are you pursuing that? No. Other than sending out resumes like, what, 2 years ago? Oh, well, I'm also sending out Good thoughts? If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear. The fear? He's right. If you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want. Well, then how come you're still at a job that you hate? I mean, why don't you quit and get the fear? Because I'm too afraid. I don't know. I mean, I would give anything to work for a designer, you know, or a buyer. I just don't wanna be 30 and still work here. Yeah. That'd be much worse than being 28 and still working here. Rachel? Yeah. Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular. Can't I just look at the handles on them? You would think. Okay. Fine. Gunther, you know what? I am a terrible waitress. Do you know why I am a terrible waitress? Because I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf. I don't care where the tray spot is. I just don't care. This is not what I wanna do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my week's notice. What?

Why? Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing? Rachel? Yeah.\n\nYou remember when you first came here, how you spent 2 weeks Being trained by another waitress. Oh, sure. Do you need me to train somebody new? Good one. Actually, Terry wants you to take the training again whenever.\n\nDo you believe that? Yeah. So that's 2 boxes of the macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you. Just a minute, Shanley.\n\nYou have no backhand. Excuse me, little one. I have a very solid backhand. Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl is not a backhand. I was shrieking like a marine.\n\nRight here. Watch me execute the 3 p's of championship play. Power, Precision, shoot, and panache. You broke a little girl's leg. I know.\n\nI feel horrible. Okay? Says here that a Muppet got whacked on Sesame Street last night. Where exactly were you around 10 ish? I'm gonna go see her.\n\nI wanna bring her something. What do you think she'd like? Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk. I'm gonna get back to retraining. Alright.\n\nSee you guys. Look out, kids. He's coming. Then I gotta go sell some Christmas trees. Have fun.\n\nOh, wait. No. Don't. I forgot. I am totally against that now.\n\nWhat? Me having a job? No. No. I am against Innocent trees being cut down in their prime and their their corpses grotesquely dressed in, like, tinsel and twinkly lights.\n\nHey. How do you sleep at night? Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around. Hey. Phoebe, listen.\n\nYou got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees. They're fulfilling their life purpose by by making people happy. Really? Yes.\n\nYes. And, the trees are happy Because for most of them, it's their only chance to see New York. And after you've delivered the drinks, You take the empty tray Gunther. Gunther, please. I have worked here for two and a half years.\n\nI know the empty trays go over there. What if you put them here? Well, you know, that's actually a really good idea because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. You know what? You should have the other waitresses do that too.\n\nThey already do. That's why they call it the tray spot. Jeez. I always heard him talk about that. I sorta just thought it was like a club they went to.\n\nOh, god. I'm I'm sorry. It's alright, Sweetheart. So this must be Kinda neat for you. I mean, your dad tells me you get a couple of days off school, and you, you don't have to sell those cookies anymore.\n\nWell, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells most wins a trip to space camp and gets to sit in a real space shuttle. Wow. You, you really like all this space stuff. Yeah.\n\nMy dad says if I spend as much time Clean apartments as I do daydream about outer space. He'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal. I think you'd have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all way to India. No. The one in Atlantic City.\n\nDad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my grandma left me. Well, good luck to dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win? The girl who won last year sold 475.\n\nYeah? So far, I've sold 75. 400. Well, that sounds doable. How much are the boxes?\n\n$5 a box. And what is second prize? A 10 speed bike, but I'd rather have something my dad couldn't sell. Will that make sense? Won't you do me one favor?\n\nIf it's not too much trouble. Yeah. Sarah, anything. Could you pull out the curtains open for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news.\n\nAnd since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up through a window so I can watch it. Yes? Yeah. Hi. I'm selling brown bird cookies.\n\nYou're no brown bird. I can see you through my peephole. No. Hi. I I'm an honorary brown bird.\n\nWhat does that mean? Well, it means that I can Sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleepovers. I can dial 9 one one at the press of a button, you know. Now go away. Please.\n\nPlease. It's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Space camp more than anything in the world. I'm pressing. A policeman is on his way. Okay.\n\nOkay. I'm going. I'm going. I can still see you. Alright.\n\nHey. Hey. What are you doing here? Well, I I thought a lot about what you said, and, I realized, maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah.\n\nOh, but, oh. Okay. Remember, hey. They're just fulfilling their Christmas Destiny. Sure.\n\nYes. Okay. Yikes. That one doesn't look very fulfilled. Oh, that's, that's one of the old ones.\n\nHe's just taken it to the back. You keep the old ones in the back? That is so ageist. But we have to make room for the fresh ones. So what happens to the old guys?\n\nLook. They go into the chipper. Well, I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds. And these come in the shapes of your favorite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and baby Jesus. Alright.\n\nI'll take a box of the cream filled Jesuses. Wait a minute. 1 box? Come on. I'm trying to send a poor little girl to space camp.\n\nI'm putting you down for 5 boxes. Chandler, what about you? Alright. Do you have any, coconut flavored deities? No.\n\nBut, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menorios. I'll tell you what. I'll put you down for 8 boxes, 1 for each night. Ma'am? Alright.\n\nI'll take 1 box of the mint treasures. 1, and that's it. I started gaining weight after I joined the brown birds. Remember? Dad bought every 1 of my boxes, and I ate them all.\n\nI know, man. Dad had to buy every 1 of your boxes because you ate them But, you know, I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time. Why don't I just put you down for 3 of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolphs? No. Oh, come on now.\n\nYou know you want them. Don't don't don't don't do this. I'll tell you what, ma. I'll give you the 1st box for free. Oh, god.\n\nI gotta go. Come on. All the cool kids are eating them. And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there. I'm training to be better at a job that I hate.\n\nMy life officially sucks. But, Rach, wasn't it supposed to be a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff. Well, yeah. I'm still pursuing that.\n\nHow exactly are you pursuing that? No. Other than sending out resumes like, what, 2 years ago? Oh, well, I'm also sending out Good thoughts? If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you got nothing pushing you to get another one.\n\nYou need the fear. The fear? He's right. If you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want. Well, then how come you're still at a job that you hate?\n\nI mean, why don't you quit and get the fear? Because I'm too afraid. I don't know. I mean, I would give anything to work for a designer, you know, or a buyer. I just don't wanna be 30 and still work here.\n\nYeah. That'd be much worse than being 28 and still working here. Rachel? Yeah. Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.\n\nCan't I just look at the handles on them? You would think. Okay. Fine. Gunther, you know what?\n\nI am a terrible waitress. Do you know why I am a terrible waitress? Because I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf.\n\nI don't care where the tray spot is. I just don't care. This is not what I wanna do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my week's notice.\n\nWhat?
