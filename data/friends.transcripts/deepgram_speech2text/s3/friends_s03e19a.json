Well, I think I'd say no to anybody right now. Age. I mean, I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. You know, like, I'd be cheating on Ross or something. Wow. So? Okay. Maybe that means that You're not over Ross yet, and you have issues with your father. I don't have any issues with my father. Okay. So it's probably just the Ross thing then. I hate this woman. I hate her. She told everyone in the company about that infomercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay? And whenever I can't do it, they're all, like, Like, laughing at me. Hello. Hey. So Rachel Cole, Wants to see me. Going over in a minute. Wow. Well, what do you think she wants?

Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop. It's still a gift. I got it from the gift shop. Okay. Alright. Give me the mug. I'll keep the mug. No. You know you know, don't do me any favors. In fact, where where's the rest of my stuff? Like like my, Hey. This book is mine. And and and and that T shirt you sleep in, I'd like that back too. Yes. I do. You know how much I love that T shirt. You never even wear that T shirt. I'm just trying to help you move on. Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty Petty. Petty, petty, petty, small. You are so just doing this out of spite. Uh-huh. No. No. No. I'm I'm gonna wear this all the time. I love this shirt. You have not worn that T shirt since you were 15. It doesn't even fit Mark. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay. Okay. If you don't mind, I'm gonna take the rest of my stuff and relax in my favorite shirt. You have a pleasant evening. So you're like a zillionaire. And you're our age. You're our age. You know what? You should, like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself. I like Pete Dakota. Yeah. Or or Mississippeet. Oh, oh, I got it. Pete Chicago. That's not a state, Joe. Oh, and Mississippi is? I gotta go, so, I'll see you guys later. Okay. You're RH. So, we offer tomorrow? Absolutely. Now get out of here, you. Okay. I'm running out of places I can touch him. Is there something wrong with me? I mean, why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old or they're too young or they're a big misogynist jerk poet like Julio, who, by the way, I'm still attracted Do. And and then there's Pete who's crazy about me, and he's absolutely perfect, and there's, like, zip going on. Wait. Seriously, does it sound like there's something wrong with me? Yeah. Kinda. Happy? Is that what I'm supposed to be, Vic? Happy? But why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out. I talked to you and nothing. You look at me, and it's nothing. Nothing. Tasty. I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history. It's it's nice. I have a question about this scene. Yes. Well, I don't understand why Adrian's attracted to Victor. Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking. Yeah. I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of a reason than that. Oh, hey.

Would it be able to recognize my voice if I talk black, dear? Oh, it it'll understand you, but it's gonna make fun of you. Oh, this is so great. Yeah.\n\nIt was. Alright then. Bye. Hello, people who do not live here. Hello.\n\nI gave you a key for emergencies. We were out of Doritos. Hey. How'd the date go with mister millionaire. Mister millionaire, new from snooty playthings.\n\n3rd life sold separately. He's great. I mean, we have such a good time together. He's so funny and so sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all. Still?\n\nNo. It's driving me crazy. I mean, in every other way, he's like the perfect guy. He has everything. Plus, he actually has everything.\n\nLife-sized imperial stormtroopers from Sharper Image? 2. Wow. Can Joey and I put them on and fight? Oh, mommy.\n\nOh, daddy. I am a big old daddy. Oh, mommy. Old daddy. I am a big old daddy.\n\nI guess he must have gotten the part in that play. Oh. Yeah. Either that or Gloria Estefan was right.

I'm Joe Echebiani.\n\nHi. Nice to meet you. Kit Miller. So the, Play is pretty great. Oh, yeah.\n\nI love Jennifer Banbury's work. She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class. Forget about it. She rocks. Where do I know you from?\n\nDoctor Drake Ramore, days of our lives, voted most datable neurosurgeon by Team B? No. That's not it. Zai, you're a soap actor. Well, this, must be pretty exciting for you being in a real play.\n\nHey. I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor. That infomercial for the milk carton spout thing. You're you're the guy who doesn't know how to pour milk.\n\nSee, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn't. Now see, that's acting. Right. And at the end, you choked on a cookie. Yeah.\n\nThat was real. Al, I cannot believe Mark asked you Oh, I know. What so what are you gonna tell him? Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no. Well, I think I'd say no to anybody right now.\n\nAge. I mean, I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. You know, like, I'd be cheating on Ross or something. Wow. So?\n\nOkay. Maybe that means that You're not over Ross yet, and you have issues with your father. I don't have any issues with my father. Okay. So it's probably just the Ross thing then.\n\nI hate this woman. I hate her. She told everyone in the company about that infomercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay? And whenever I can't do it, they're all, like, Like, laughing at me.\n\nHello. Hey. So Rachel Cole, Wants to see me. Going over in a minute. Wow.\n\nWell, what do you think she wants? Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted, and she realizes that life without me sucks. It's possible. You are very lovable. I'd miss you if I broke up with you.\n\nYou're just trying to be supportive. You know, be supportive like a guy. If I broke up with you, I'd miss you. Hi. Hi.\n\nYou, wanted to see me? Yeah. Here's a box of your stuff. What? You know, it's just like hats and Shirt and CDs, just sort of stuff that you've left here.\n\nWhat are you doing? Are you are you trying to hurt me or something? Oh, Ross. It it just seems that, you know, it's time we, you know, move on. I mean, don't you think?\n\nYes. Yeah. Yes. I do. Yeah.\n\nYeah. I I really do. Hey. This this was a gift. Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.\n\nIt's still a gift. I got it from the gift shop. Okay. Alright. Give me the mug.\n\nI'll keep the mug. No. You know you know, don't do me any favors. In fact, where where's the rest of my stuff? Like like my, Hey.\n\nThis book is mine. And and and and that T shirt you sleep in, I'd like that back too. Yes. I do. You know how much I love that T shirt.\n\nYou never even wear that T shirt. I'm just trying to help you move on. Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty Petty. Petty, petty, petty, small.\n\nYou are so just doing this out of spite. Uh-huh. No. No. No.\n\nI'm I'm gonna wear this all the time. I love this shirt. You have not worn that T shirt since you were 15. It doesn't even fit Mark. Oh, yeah.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay.\n\nOkay. If you don't mind, I'm gonna take the rest of my stuff and relax in my favorite shirt. You have a pleasant evening. So you're like a zillionaire. And you're our age.\n\nYou're our age. You know what? You should, like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself. I like Pete Dakota. Yeah.\n\nOr or Mississippeet. Oh, oh, I got it. Pete Chicago. That's not a state, Joe. Oh, and Mississippi is?\n\nI gotta go, so, I'll see you guys later. Okay. You're RH. So, we offer tomorrow? Absolutely.\n\nNow get out of here, you. Okay. I'm running out of places I can touch him. Is there something wrong with me? I mean, why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future?\n\nEither they're too old or they're too young or they're a big misogynist jerk poet like Julio, who, by the way, I'm still attracted Do. And and then there's Pete who's crazy about me, and he's absolutely perfect, and there's, like, zip going on. Wait. Seriously, does it sound like there's something wrong with me? Yeah.\n\nKinda. Happy? Is that what I'm supposed to be, Vic? Happy? But why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be?\n\nBecause I sure as hell can't figure it out. I talked to you and nothing. You look at me, and it's nothing. Nothing. Tasty.\n\nI'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history. It's it's nice. I have a question about this scene. Yes. Well, I don't understand why Adrian's attracted to Victor.\n\nPeel the onion. First of all, he's good looking. Yeah. I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of a reason than that.
