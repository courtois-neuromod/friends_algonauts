Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturizer from Chandler. Hey. You you how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.\n\nAnyway, her and Ross just started yelling at Each other. Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else. Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should have forgiven him by now.\n\nWoah. He is so unreasonable. God. Although, I think I understand what he means. Oh my god.\n\nThis is like 60 Minutes. Okay. When when at first, you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug, and then, you know, you just feel bad for people because they needed to make their hair grow. You know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced.\n\nMan, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after cub scouts. You know, I had a dream that Ross and Rachel were still together. They never broke up, We were all just, like, hanging out, and everyone was happy. I had the same dream. Yeah.\n\nAnd nobody slept with that Xerox girl. Oh, I had the opposite dream. You know what? Maybe it's gonna be okay. I mean, it's been a week.\n\nYeah. It's never taken me more than a week to get over a relationship. It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship. Okay.
