Yes. I'm sure. You really sure? I'll call you back. So we can be friends who sleep together. Absolutely. This'll just be something we do, like racquetball. Sounds smart and healthy to me. So, just out of curiosity, Do you currently have any other racquetball buddies? Just your dad. Although, that's actually racquetball. You know, I I do have a blind date with my sister's neighbor next Tuesday. Do you want me to cancel it? No. No. Yeah. Because if you did, that means you'd be canceling for me, and we're just friends. Exactly. And besides, you know what? It wouldn't be fair anyway because, My mother is trying to set me up with some lawyer. So who's this lawyer? Oh, no. She doesn't actually have one, but she's looking. Hey. Hey. Oh, don't sit down. Ready to go to the batting cage? Yeah. You bet. And, first, here's a gift. Oh, wow. Hey. Stretchy pants. Well, those are the greatest in the world. If I were you, I'd wear them every day every day. Jeez. Thank you. Really? That's, that's so nice. But, To be honest, I don't think I can wear these.

I mean, this has been the most amazing week. I mean, would it be so terrible? Oh, even if we are friends who who've lived together. Or maybe someday, friends who who stood up in front of their other friends and Vowed to be friends forever. Wow. You know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, But nothing's changed. That's not true. You don't have a mustache. Okay. Okay. One thing's changed. But we still want different things, and we know how this is gonna end. You know what? I gotta walk out of here right now because getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do.

Good. So you owe me 3 pretty things. Yeah. I've been thinking a lot about you too.\n\nOh, no. It's hard, this platonomy zing. It's a word. Yeah. I do think it's better this way.\n\nYeah. We're being smart. Yes. I'm sure. You really sure?\n\nI'll call you back. So we can be friends who sleep together. Absolutely. This'll just be something we do, like racquetball. Sounds smart and healthy to me.\n\nSo, just out of curiosity, Do you currently have any other racquetball buddies? Just your dad. Although, that's actually racquetball. You know, I I do have a blind date with my sister's neighbor next Tuesday. Do you want me to cancel it?\n\nNo. No. Yeah. Because if you did, that means you'd be canceling for me, and we're just friends. Exactly.\n\nAnd besides, you know what? It wouldn't be fair anyway because, My mother is trying to set me up with some lawyer. So who's this lawyer? Oh, no. She doesn't actually have one, but she's looking.\n\nHey. Hey. Oh, don't sit down. Ready to go to the batting cage? Yeah.\n\nYou bet. And, first, here's a gift. Oh, wow. Hey. Stretchy pants.\n\nWell, those are the greatest in the world. If I were you, I'd wear them every day every day. Jeez. Thank you. Really?\n\nThat's, that's so nice. But, To be honest, I don't think I can wear these. They're so tight. I feel like I'm on display. I'm sorry.\n\nIt's alright. Don't don't figure. Hey. How's it going? Good.\n\nGood. Good. Hey, Rach. How you doing with the shining? Danny just went into room 217.\n\nOh, the next part's the best. When that dead lady in the bathtub Oh, no. No. No. No.\n\nNo. No. No. No. Come on.\n\nYou're gonna ruin it. Alright. I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those Two blanks in the hallway? Yeah.\n\nThat's very cool. Yep. All blank and no blank match Blanka. Blanka. Oh, no.\n\nNo. No. The end. When Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then in the last second they get away, oh. Joey, I can't believe you just did that.\n\nI can't believe she cracked your code. Alright. Okay. Laurie proposes to Joe, and she says no even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marrying Amy. Hey.\n\nMine was by accident. Alright. The boiler explodes and destroys the hotel and kills the dad. Beth dies. Beth Beth dies?\n\nIs that true? If I keep reading, is Beth gonna die? No. Beth doesn't die. She doesn't die, does she, Rachel?\n\nWhat? Joey's asking if you've just ruined the 1st book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson. Go sit. No. She doesn't die.\n\nThen why would you say that? Because I wanted to hurt you. Oh, there they are. I I I dropped my keys. Oh.\n\nGot him. Hi. Sorry. I'm sorry. You would not believe my day.\n\nI had to work 2 shifts. And then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs in a grill fire. What are you smiling at? I'm sorry. I was just thinking your day could still pick up.\n\nRight. Hello. I love this friend thing. Listen. Robert's gonna be here any second, so one of you just tell him.\n\nPlease, right now? No. Every time I see him, it's like, is it on the loose? Is it watching me? We can't tell him.\n\nYou can't go up to a guy you barely know and Talk about his stuff. He's right. Even if it's to say something complimentary. Why don't you just tell him? You're going out with him.\n\nOh, way too awkward. No. I can't. I haven't even seen it with permission yet. So what what do I do?\n\nJust, you know, break up with him? I don't know. I think this is an unsolvable problem. It's a Kyrie at Mariah. The unsolvable problem they gave to captain Kirk is part of his training to be a star commander.\n\nKobayashi Maru. What's a keria moriah? It's a place with the cheap rooms where we stayed in Israel. Hey. Hey.\n\nSo you're ready for the gym? They got this new rock climbing wall. We can spot each other. Yo. I can spot you from here.\n\nWhat? Okay. Listen, Robert. Hey. Don't we have to Yeah.\n\nWe got yeah. I think you're really, really great. God. Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me?\n\nIs this something I'm putting out there?

Well, It's just like everyone else's apartment. It's got, rooms and walls and ceilings. Oh, I just wanted to see where you live. Now give me the tour.\n\nOh my god. Oh my god. This is the living room. Alright. And this is the kitchen.\n\nAs you're operating? Wait a minute. Don't I get to see the bedroom? Bedroom. No.\n\nIt's pretty much your typical bedroom. We're still on this side of the door. Mhmm. Yeah. But I didn't get to say it.\n\nOh, shoot. Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening. So, who who is she? Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about.\n\nShe called and switched From Tuesday. Oh, do you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend because I am Totally fine with this. Well, you seem fine. Okay.\n\nYou know what? I'm I'm not fine. I'm not. I mean, how can I be fun hearing you come in with her? She wants to see your bedroom.\n\nYou know what? What if we're friends who don't see other people? You mean like exclusive friends? Why not? I mean, this has been the most amazing week.\n\nI mean, would it be so terrible? Oh, even if we are friends who who've lived together. Or maybe someday, friends who who stood up in front of their other friends and Vowed to be friends forever. Wow. You know we're back where we were.\n\nHoney, I would love to do all that, But nothing's changed. That's not true. You don't have a mustache. Okay. Okay.\n\nOne thing's changed. But we still want different things, and we know how this is gonna end. You know what? I gotta walk out of here right now because getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.\n\nI know I couldn't. Yeah. So How about 1 last game of racquetball? Watch the thorns. What?\n\nThat is really, really sick.
