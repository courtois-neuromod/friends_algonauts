Wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back? Yeah. Oh my god.\n\nIs this what it's like to be you? Well, you're really crazy about her, Oh, you have no idea. And when we're on stage, I get to to kiss her and and touch her. But then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart. Oh, So great to see you feeling like this.\n\nHey. Hey. Hey. Like, Dad called this morning, and, aunt Sylvia passed away. Yes.\n\nYes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We were all pretty shaken up about it.\n\nWait. Am I missing something, though? Because I always thought death was supposed to be sad in a way. Well, aunt Sylvia was, well, not a nice person. Oh, she was a Cruel, cranky, old bitch.\n\nAnd I'm sorry she died. Did dad say I get the dollhouse? You get the dollhouse. I get the dollhouse. Wow.\n\nA house for dolls. That is so cool. When I was a kid, I had a barrel. Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse? No.\n\nJust a barrel. You know what? You can play with my dollhouse. Really? Really?\n\nAnytime you want. You know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse. But, no, it was to be looked at but never played with. My grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me. More of a bathtub type situation.\n\nNow, Monica, she did give you one chance. She told Monica she could play with the dollhouse if she lost \u00a320. Yeah. Well, look who's losing weight now, aunt Sylvia. Hey, Sophie.\n\nHey, Rach. Thanks. Thanks for lunch, Chandler. You don't even have to walk me all the way back up here. Oh, that's that's okay.\n\nNo problem. Honey, you do realize we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office? Yes. I realize that. Summer catalog.\n\nThat's the stuff. Rachel, I need the Versace invoice. Hello. You don't work for me. Joanna, this is my friend, Chandler Bing.\n\nJoanna. Bing. That's a great name. Thanks. It's, Gaelic for thy turkey's done.\n\nSo, I'm gonna go. Nice nice meeting you. You too. Bye, Chandler. So, what's wrong with him?\n\nOh, nothing. He's just goofy like that. I actually hardly notice it anymore. Oh, no. No.\n\nNo. No. I mean, is he, married or involved with anyone? No. No.\n\nHe's not married or involved with anyone. Rachel, actually, you know what? Forget it. Well, I'll I'll ask it for you if you wanted to. Would you?\n\nOr is it just too sad and desperate and, you know, something that Sophie would do? I am here. I know that. Look at it. Oh, Wallpaper's a little faded.\n\nThat's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors? Hey. Who?\n\nHey. Oh. Oh, Monica. It's so beautiful. I know.\n\nSo I'm here ready to play. Okay. I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. What's this? That's a dog.\n\nEvery house should have a dog. Not one that can pee on the roof. But, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste. And is this in case the house sneezes? No.\n\nNo. That's the ghost for the attic. I don't want a ghost. Well, nobody wants a ghost, But you've got one because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground. Wait a minute.\n\nThe house was built on radioactive waste and an ancient Indian burial ground. That would never happen. Okay. Obviously, you don't know much about the US government. Hey.\n\nHey. I need to talk to you. Sure. What's up? Oh, sorry.\n\nI met Chandler. I I know. Isn't it? Well, if something comes up Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward face.
