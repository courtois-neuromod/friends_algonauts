We'll just wait till January gets home because it it'll be more fun that way. Alright. Okay. Okay. It was, like, 4 years ago. Okay. Ginger and I had gone out a few times. And then this 1 weekend, we went up to her dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog, Pepper. Well, that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner. You gave her food poisoning. I wish. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well, I woke up in the middle of the night, and I saw that the fire was dying out, so I picked up a log and threw it on, or at least what I thought was a log. Oh my god. You threw pepper on the fire. I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a, Artificial leg. Oh my god. You threw it on the fire? What? She must have freaked out. Yeah. She must've. You don't know? Well, I Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire? I ran. You ran? Yeah. Through the woods with no socks on. Well, That's the best kiss I've had with anybody I met in a men's room. Actually, me too. Oh, foot in a puddle. Foot all in a puddle. Oh, damn. I hate that. Yeah. We're gonna have to get you out of those shoes. Oh, don't worry about it. No. Really. You're gonna freeze. No. I'm not. You're not? What are you what are you, got a bionic foot? Someday. Maybe. Funny book? Oh, no. No. I'm just Thinking about something funny I heard today. Mark Mark saying I'll see you Saturday. Yeah. At the lecture. I told you that last week. You said you didn't mind. Oh, no. No. No. It's it's not the lecture. I mind. Please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark. Well Oh my god. Ross. Well, I'm sorry, but, look. If you're not working with him anymore, why do you still have to do stuff with him? Because he's my Friend. Okay. But do you really need another friend? I mean Okay. Well, if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark? Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing? I don't know. You thought to you Saturday was funny. But, honey, Mark is in fashion.

How'd you know I'd be here?\n\nI ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played her a lot song. Alright. Listen. I have to go to the bathroom. But if the place where the big fish comes up again, I'd like to know whether that's several big fish or just 1 big fish.\n\nSo, Phoebe tells us you write jingles. Actually, I said she abandoned me to write jingles. Anything we might have heard of? Yeah. Home is never far away.\n\nHome is home stars too. Yeah. But I don't do that anymore. I I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me. Bummer.\n\nWell, you know, I was just, I was just thinking and just hoping that, maybe we'd wanna get back together. No. But thanks. Oh, come on, Phoebe. Would you just think about it?\n\nOkay. No. But thanks. Okay. See you, Pheebs.\n\nWow. That was kinda brutal. Well, okay. Let this be a lesson to all of you. Alright?\n\nOnce you once you betray me, I become like the ice Woman. You know? I'm just very cold, hard, unyielding. You know? There's nothing.\n\nNothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please? Someone in there? No. This is just part of a daredevil game that I play called wait until the last moment before I burst and die.\n\nJeez, man. Did you fall high? So, did you? Did did did you fall high? Someone was in the ladies' room.\n\nI couldn't wait. Left a lid up for you, though. You know what? Got the go, go ahead. I'm I'm talking to, this is the part where you'd say your name.\n\nGinger.

Hello. Hey, Ross.\n\nUh-huh. I've got some bad news. What? I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I'm gonna have to come back up here. Come on, sweetie.\n\nYou've had to work late every night for the past 2 weeks. What is it this time? Actually, it's kinda my fault. I I quit today. But work comes 1st oh, hey.\n\nBut that's sad about you, though. What happened? What happened? Burnout? Burn all out, Did you?\n\nNo. He's leaving for a better job. Oh, well, that's great.

You know those are a delicacy in India. Yeah.\n\nThat was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. It's like the 20th time today. Yeah. Good luck, Leslie. Wow.\n\nMust've hurt you pretty bad. Well, yeah. You know, we were best friends. Ever since we were little, our moms worked on the barge together. Oh.\n\nYou 2 must have been so cute running around on a barge. You never run on a barge. Hey. Hey. Hey.\n\nIs, is Chandler around? Nope. He met some girl at the coffee house. Oh. Yeah.\n\nGinger something. No. No. No. Are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like ginger?\n\nLike, Ginger? No. It was Ginger. I remember because when he told me, I said, the movie star. Oh, man.\n\nThat's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did. Why? What did you do? Oh oh oh, no.\n\nNo. I can't I can't tell you that. It's like the most Awful, horrible thing I've ever done in my whole life. Well, you're really not making us wanna hear it, Les. But you know what?\n\nDon't tell us. We'll just wait till January gets home because it it'll be more fun that way. Alright. Okay. Okay.\n\nIt was, like, 4 years ago. Okay. Ginger and I had gone out a few times. And then this 1 weekend, we went up to her dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog, Pepper.\n\nWell, that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner. You gave her food poisoning. I wish. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well, I woke up in the middle of the night, and I saw that the fire was dying out, so I picked up a log and threw it on, or at least what I thought was a log.\n\nOh my god. You threw pepper on the fire. I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a, Artificial leg. Oh my god.\n\nYou threw it on the fire? What? She must have freaked out. Yeah. She must've.\n\nYou don't know? Well, I Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire? I ran. You ran? Yeah.\n\nThrough the woods with no socks on. Well, That's the best kiss I've had with anybody I met in a men's room. Actually, me too. Oh, foot in a puddle. Foot all in a puddle.\n\nOh, damn. I hate that. Yeah. We're gonna have to get you out of those shoes. Oh, don't worry about it.\n\nNo. Really. You're gonna freeze. No. I'm not.\n\nYou're not? What are you what are you, got a bionic foot? Someday. Maybe. Funny book?\n\nOh, no. No. I'm just Thinking about something funny I heard today. Mark Mark saying I'll see you Saturday. Yeah.\n\nAt the lecture. I told you that last week. You said you didn't mind. Oh, no. No.\n\nNo. It's it's not the lecture. I mind. Please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark. Well Oh my god.\n\nRoss. Well, I'm sorry, but, look. If you're not working with him anymore, why do you still have to do stuff with him? Because he's my Friend. Okay.\n\nBut do you really need another friend? I mean Okay. Well, if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark? Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?\n\nI don't know. You thought to you Saturday was funny. But, honey, Mark is in fashion. I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never wanna go to a lecture with me.\n\nI would love to go with you. Really? Yeah. Hey. I I have clothes.\n\nI even pick them out. I mean, for for all you know, I could be a fashion Munger. Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?\n\nWhat should I wear?
