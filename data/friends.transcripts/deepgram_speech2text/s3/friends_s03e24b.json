Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble. Alright. Here you go, Garrett. Let's go. Here we go, gentlemen. Here we go. Are you ready? Hey. It's me, Monica. Who else would you be? Well, earlier when you were coming to, you you called me Fran. Can I just tell you how proud I am of you? It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant, you suck. I thought you were nuts at first. I did, but you did it. And now you can just look back at this whole thing with no regrets. Look back. Well, you're not gonna keep going, are you? Well, let me ask you a question. Am I the ultimate fighting champion? Well, no. But Well, I'm not gonna stop until I'm the ultimate fighting champion. That guy stood on your neck until you passed out. Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1 that burned down my dad's garage. It was Mars 2 that would only schedule appointments in January and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight never to let a guy stand on my neck. You didn't know that already? Look. I'm gonna think it better. Okay. I promise you. Okay. Just get a lot better fast. Oh, one other thing. Hochi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration. Yeah. That that was the problem. Hey. Hey. How long until Pete's fight? About 5 minutes. Right now, they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently, he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves. Hot dog? Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you. So, Ross, how, how did it go with Bonnie? Oh, I gotta tell you, I I wasn't expecting to like her at all. I mean, I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific. Ugh. It's too bad. No. I I'm saying I liked her. Yeah. You know what? There are other fish in the sea. Thebes, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again. Okay. I hear you. Are you capable of talking about anything Hey. Which one's my turkey burger? The one next to my foot. Sorry. Hey. Flight's starting. K. Be right in. So, did your boss try to slap you again today? Nine times. Okay? I had to put on lotion. But it's gonna be okay because as of tomorrow, I'm conducting an experiment. And if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free. Fight over. Excuse me, Doug. Hey there, sports fan. Bing. You got those numbers for me? No. I, I didn't do them. Oh, You forgot? No. No. I just, didn't do them. Instead, I, hung out with some friends and had a couple of beers. So I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise. Well, I got attacked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home. Tappanee Bridge never looks smaller. That's okay. You're still my number one guy. Ding. Duck. I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the way that you express yourself. Oh, is it the swearing? I mean, is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell you, if it is, well, you can just kiss my ass. No. No. It it's not about the swearing. It's more about, The way that you, occasionally concentrate your enthusiasm On my buttocks. Oh. Oh, and don't get me wrong. I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I I have a rather Sensitive posterior. And, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous. No. Say no more. You know? It Takes guts to bring this up. Bing, you're okay. Okay. Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant or inside his shower drain. Oh my god. Phoebe, look at Ross and that girl. No. No. Look at that. It's a lot of ants. They're working as a team, Amy. Right. Oh, yeah. Wow. Oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Oof. I hope he lets her down easy. Come on, Phoebe. Look at that. They are not breaking up. Look at them. Okay then? You know what that is? That is a that is a second date. That's what that is. Look at that. She just put her hand on I Oh, no. That really is nothing. She's very sexually aggressive. Oh, baby. This is all your fault. Now he loves her. He's to marry her, and this is all your fault. You said it was okay. You said she was bold. What? What? What? What? What? Stevie, we can't we just can't let it happen. Okay? We have to do something, but we have to break them up. Okay? You Just go in there and, like, shave her head. You owe me 1 bold girl. Okay. First of all, breathe. 2nd of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided you didn't wanna be with Ross? Yes? Well, isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy? Yes. So I just you know, I didn't expect him to be this happy Soon? Oh, no. What? Oh, we killed them all. No. It's okay. It's not as bad as it looks. It's a precaution. I'm not supposed to move my spine. Please tell me you're stopping now. I'm fine. I'd fight tonight if they let me. Now see this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror. You are insane. You you've gotta give this up. I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, Me or Superman? Now I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but, you know, kids are stupid. Sit down. Alright. Please, listen to me. You are terrible at this. K? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever, Ever. You know, I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's apple, But that really hurt. Well, then, You know what? I care about you too much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me. Well, if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this. Then I've gotta go. Bye. Monica? Yes? Could you leave a note? Because I'm on a lot of painkillers now, and I don't know if I'll remember this tomorrow. So in conclusion, the lines all go up, so I'm happy. Great job, team. Tomorrow, 8:30. Phil, nice job. Stevens, where you go? Goldberg, you maniac. I love you. Vague, Good job. Couldn't have done it without you. Thank you, sir. Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase, you know, By accident, Of course, you did. We got something else too, you bastard. Yeah. What about you? You're not feeling left out or anything, are you? No. No. Not at all. That's that's ridiculous. Everybody else got 1, and you want 1 too, don't you? Yes. Yes. I do. Now get on out of here, you. Pete Becker is circling the ring now. Looks like he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is jaunching. Run, you crazy rich freak. No. I can't watch this. Check it out. He's winning. He's winning. Really? No. Uh-oh. Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favorite area. Oh. Oh, wait. If that's his favorite area, why is he being so mean to it? This is ironic.

Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble. Alright. Here you go, Garrett. Let's go.\n\nHere we go, gentlemen. Here we go. Are you ready? Hey. It's me, Monica.\n\nWho else would you be? Well, earlier when you were coming to, you you called me Fran. Can I just tell you how proud I am of you? It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant, you suck. I thought you were nuts at first.\n\nI did, but you did it. And now you can just look back at this whole thing with no regrets. Look back. Well, you're not gonna keep going, are you? Well, let me ask you a question.\n\nAm I the ultimate fighting champion? Well, no. But Well, I'm not gonna stop until I'm the ultimate fighting champion. That guy stood on your neck until you passed out. Let me tell you a story.\n\nWhen I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1 that burned down my dad's garage. It was Mars 2 that would only schedule appointments in January and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight never to let a guy stand on my neck. You didn't know that already?\n\nLook. I'm gonna think it better. Okay. I promise you. Okay.\n\nJust get a lot better fast. Oh, one other thing. Hochi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration. Yeah. That that was the problem.\n\nHey. Hey. How long until Pete's fight? About 5 minutes. Right now, they're interviewing his opponent.\n\nApparently, he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves. Hot dog? Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you.\n\nSo, Ross, how, how did it go with Bonnie? Oh, I gotta tell you, I I wasn't expecting to like her at all. I mean, I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific. Ugh. It's too bad.\n\nNo. I I'm saying I liked her. Yeah. You know what? There are other fish in the sea.\n\nThebes, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again. Okay. I hear you.\n\nAre you capable of talking about anything Hey. Which one's my turkey burger? The one next to my foot. Sorry. Hey.\n\nFlight's starting. K. Be right in. So, did your boss try to slap you again today? Nine times.\n\nOkay? I had to put on lotion. But it's gonna be okay because as of tomorrow, I'm conducting an experiment. And if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free. Fight over.\n\nExcuse me, Doug. Hey there, sports fan. Bing. You got those numbers for me? No.\n\nI, I didn't do them. Oh, You forgot? No. No. I just, didn't do them.\n\nInstead, I, hung out with some friends and had a couple of beers. So I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise. Well, I got attacked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home. Tappanee Bridge never looks smaller.\n\nThat's okay. You're still my number one guy. Ding. Duck. I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the way that you express yourself.\n\nOh, is it the swearing? I mean, is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell you, if it is, well, you can just kiss my ass. No. No.\n\nIt it's not about the swearing. It's more about, The way that you, occasionally concentrate your enthusiasm On my buttocks. Oh. Oh, and don't get me wrong. I appreciate the sentiment.\n\nIt's just that I I have a rather Sensitive posterior. And, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous. No. Say no more. You know?\n\nIt Takes guts to bring this up. Bing, you're okay. Okay. Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant or inside his shower drain.\n\nOh my god. Phoebe, look at Ross and that girl. No. No. Look at that.\n\nIt's a lot of ants. They're working as a team, Amy. Right. Oh, yeah. Wow.\n\nOh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Oof. I hope he lets her down easy. Come on, Phoebe. Look at that.\n\nThey are not breaking up. Look at them. Okay then? You know what that is? That is a that is a second date.\n\nThat's what that is. Look at that. She just put her hand on I Oh, no. That really is nothing. She's very sexually aggressive.\n\nOh, baby. This is all your fault. Now he loves her. He's to marry her, and this is all your fault. You said it was okay.\n\nYou said she was bold. What? What? What? What?\n\nWhat? Stevie, we can't we just can't let it happen. Okay? We have to do something, but we have to break them up. Okay?\n\nYou Just go in there and, like, shave her head. You owe me 1 bold girl. Okay. First of all, breathe. 2nd of all, I don't get it.\n\nAren't you the one that decided you didn't wanna be with Ross? Yes? Well, isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy? Yes.\n\nSo I just you know, I didn't expect him to be this happy Soon? Oh, no. What? Oh, we killed them all. No.\n\nIt's okay. It's not as bad as it looks. It's a precaution. I'm not supposed to move my spine. Please tell me you're stopping now.\n\nI'm fine. I'd fight tonight if they let me. Now see this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror. You are insane.\n\nYou you've gotta give this up. I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, Me or Superman? Now I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but, you know, kids are stupid.\n\nSit down. Alright. Please, listen to me. You are terrible at this. K?\n\nYou are the worst ultimate fighter ever, Ever. You know, I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's apple, But that really hurt. Well, then, You know what? I care about you too much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.\n\nWell, if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this. Then I've gotta go. Bye. Monica?\n\nYes? Could you leave a note? Because I'm on a lot of painkillers now, and I don't know if I'll remember this tomorrow. So in conclusion, the lines all go up, so I'm happy. Great job, team.\n\nTomorrow, 8:30. Phil, nice job. Stevens, where you go? Goldberg, you maniac. I love you.\n\nVague, Good job. Couldn't have done it without you. Thank you, sir. Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase, you know, By accident, Of course, you did.\n\nWe got something else too, you bastard. Yeah. What about you? You're not feeling left out or anything, are you? No.\n\nNo. Not at all. That's that's ridiculous. Everybody else got 1, and you want 1 too, don't you? Yes.\n\nYes. I do. Now get on out of here, you. Pete Becker is circling the ring now. Looks like he's just trying to feel him out.\n\nOh, Bruiser is jaunching. Run, you crazy rich freak. No. I can't watch this. Check it out.\n\nHe's winning. He's winning. Really? No. Uh-oh.\n\nBruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favorite area. Oh. Oh, wait. If that's his favorite area, why is he being so mean to it? This is ironic.\n\nOf your last 2 boyfriends, Friends, Richard didn't wanna have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.", "paragraphs": [{"sentences": [{"text": "Opponent's strength and
