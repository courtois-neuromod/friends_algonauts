Well, Estelle tried. You know? The casting director told her I missed my chance. Well, that is unfair. I'll call her. I'll tell her it was totally my fault. Jane, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends. She only talks to agents. What a sad little life she must live. Okay. Oh. What are you doing? What are you doing? No. No. No. I know. I know. Oh. Hi. This is Caitlin from Phoebe Buffay's office. Is, Anne there for Phoebe? She'll know what it's about. Hang up. Hang up, please. Annie. Hi. Listen. We've got a problem with Joey Tribbiani. Apparently, he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no. I don't know what I'm gonna do with her. No. Alright. So your husband leaves you and then burns down the apartment. The world does not stop. Is anybody else scared? Right. Well, look. If Joey loses this audition, then that is it for Estelle. I don't care. Annie, you are a doll. What time can you see him? I need a pad. Uh-huh. Get the woman a pad. Get the woman a pad. A pad. A pad. Oh, now you want a pad. Well, that's funny. Ugly naked guy is still naked, But his dog's wearing a sweater. Hey. Hey. He is my Boy, here's my boy, and here's his Barbie. What's, what's my boy doing with the barbie? He picked it out at the toy store himself. He loves it. He carries it everywhere. It's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kickie beret. Yeah. It's it's it's cute. Why Why why does he have it again? So he's got a doll. So what? Unless you're Frady's gonna grow up to be in show business. What do you think that has anything to do with that? He's been raised by 2 women, would it? You know what? It's fine. If you're okay with the Barbie thing, so am I. Give daddy the barbie. Give give the barbie. Okay. How about don't you wanna play with a monster truck? Okay. Oh. Oh, how about a dino soldier? Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll? I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob? I love that movie. It is. Joey, what are you doing? Sorry. It just felt nice. Joe. Joe, answer the phone. Hey. I only got 1 good arm. You know? You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater. Just do it. Okay? It's Janice. And if I get it, I'm gonna have to see her tomorrow. Oh, that's great. I'm gonna have to see her tonight. What's the idea? Why don't you wanna see Janice? Okay. Last night at dinner, When the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate, and then she took all my tomatoes. And that's bad because You hate chicken piccata? Mhmm. You didn't wanna share your tomatoes. Tomatoes are very important Indeed. No. It's like all of a sudden we were this couple. Okay? And this alarm started going off my head. You know?

Don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel to the other side. Where there's no fear of commitment. With anything do we have any thoughts here? Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself because as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than 1 girl in the car. Right? But it it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else. You know? Face your fear. You have a fear of heights? You go to the top of the building. You're afraid of bugs? Get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment. So I say, you go in there, And you'd be the most committed guy there ever was. Amazingly, that makes sense. Do you think? Oh, yeah. Go for it, man. Jump off The high dive. Stare down the barrel of the gun. Pee into the wind. Yeah. Joe, I assure you, if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm gonna be pretty much peeing every which way.

How many times has this happened to you?\n\nThere's gotta be a better way. Rachel, there are no good movies. So let's go to a bad one and make out. Perhaps you would like me to like this so you can bunny bump against my back. Hey.\n\nHey. Hey, man. What's up? Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today.\n\nThe first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message? I tell you, I do enjoy guilt, but, it wasn't me. Yes. It was.\n\nIt was him. Uh-huh. Okay. It was me. How was it you?\n\nWell, it was just it was all so crazy. You know? I mean, Chandler was in the closet counting to 10, and he was up to 7, and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I I I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See all of it.\n\nYep. That's my audition. See? Now this is why I keep notepads everywhere. Yep.\n\nAnd that's why we don't invite you to play. What is the great tragedy here? You you go get yourself another appointment. Well, Estelle tried. You know?\n\nThe casting director told her I missed my chance. Well, that is unfair. I'll call her. I'll tell her it was totally my fault. Jane, you can't do that.\n\nThe casting director doesn't talk to friends. She only talks to agents. What a sad little life she must live. Okay. Oh.\n\nWhat are you doing? What are you doing? No. No. No.\n\nI know. I know. Oh. Hi. This is Caitlin from Phoebe Buffay's office.\n\nIs, Anne there for Phoebe? She'll know what it's about. Hang up. Hang up, please. Annie.\n\nHi. Listen. We've got a problem with Joey Tribbiani. Apparently, he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office?\n\nEstelle, no. I don't know what I'm gonna do with her. No. Alright. So your husband leaves you and then burns down the apartment.\n\nThe world does not stop. Is anybody else scared? Right. Well, look. If Joey loses this audition, then that is it for Estelle.\n\nI don't care. Annie, you are a doll. What time can you see him? I need a pad. Uh-huh.\n\nGet the woman a pad. Get the woman a pad. A pad. A pad. Oh, now you want a pad.\n\nWell, that's funny. Ugly naked guy is still naked, But his dog's wearing a sweater. Hey. Hey. He is my Boy, here's my boy, and here's his Barbie.\n\nWhat's, what's my boy doing with the barbie? He picked it out at the toy store himself. He loves it. He carries it everywhere. It's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kickie beret.\n\nYeah. It's it's it's cute. Why Why why does he have it again? So he's got a doll. So what?\n\nUnless you're Frady's gonna grow up to be in show business. What do you think that has anything to do with that? He's been raised by 2 women, would it? You know what? It's fine.\n\nIf you're okay with the Barbie thing, so am I. Give daddy the barbie. Give give the barbie. Okay. How about don't you wanna play with a monster truck?\n\nOkay. Oh. Oh, how about a dino soldier? Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?\n\nI gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob? I love that movie. It is. Joey, what are you doing?\n\nSorry. It just felt nice. Joe. Joe, answer the phone. Hey.\n\nI only got 1 good arm. You know? You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater. Just do it.\n\nOkay? It's Janice. And if I get it, I'm gonna have to see her tomorrow. Oh, that's great. I'm gonna have to see her tonight.\n\nWhat's the idea? Why don't you wanna see Janice? Okay. Last night at dinner, When the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate, and then she took all my tomatoes. And that's bad because You hate chicken piccata?\n\nMhmm. You didn't wanna share your tomatoes. Tomatoes are very important Indeed. No. It's like all of a sudden we were this couple.\n\nOkay? And this alarm started going off my head. You know? Run for your life. Get out of the building.\n\nUgh. Men are unbelievable. Janice just thought she was giving you chicken. She didn't think she was giving you scary chicken. What is it with you people?\n\nI mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away. I know that That's why I don't wanna go tonight. I'm afraid I'm gonna say something stupid. Oh, You mean like that guy thing where you act all mean and distant until you get us to break up with you. Mhmm.\n\nHey. Do you know about that? What what do I do? I wanna get past this. Don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing.\n\nI wanna go through the tunnel to the other side. Where there's no fear of commitment. With anything do we have any thoughts here? Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself because as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than 1 girl in the car. Right?\n\nBut it it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else. You know? Face your fear. You have a fear of heights? You go to the top of the building.\n\nYou're afraid of bugs? Get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment. So I say, you go in there, And you'd be the most committed guy there ever was.\n\nAmazingly, that makes sense. Do you think? Oh, yeah. Go for it, man. Jump off The high dive.\n\nStare down the barrel of the gun. Pee into the wind. Yeah. Joe, I assure you, if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm gonna be pretty much peeing every which way. Oh, You guys listen to this and tell me what you think.\n\nOkay? Okay. That's interesting. Oh, because it's a beeper. Oh, it's your audition from this morning.\n\nOh. Oh. Can I use the phone again? Sure, Babes, you know, that's what's there for.

Oh, you are such a sweetheart.\n\nI would love to have lunch with you. How about we have lunch next? Went through a tunnel. Unbelievable. Thank you so much.\n\nIt was really fun. I mean, I've Never talked on a car phone before. I'm so amazing. Can you do me this huge favor? See, there's this one other audition that I really, really want and Estelle couldn't get me in.\n\nI don't know. I mean, it was fun one time, but Come on. Please. It would just be this 1 more.
