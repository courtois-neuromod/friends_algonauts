But You know what? Maybe it's just all for the best. Well, yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain.\n\nOh, sweetie.

And now it's now it's gone, and I don't know why. Well, I can tell you why.\n\nIt's It's because of me. But you know what? I only did it because I love you. Okay? What?\n\nWell, I I kind of had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you 2 shouldn't be together. Know, and you're gonna see it too one day. You really, really will. Wait a minute. Wait.\n\nThis is because of you? Okay. Well, you didn't wait. No. My mother didn't want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.\n\nBut Well, you know what? I came to you because I thought you'd understand. Oh, no. I you know, I would storm out of here right now If if I had some money or a place to go. Alright.\n\nSo, Ross, if you had $1,000,000, what's the first thing you'd buy? I'd probably get some municipal bonds and then put the rest of the money in the bank and live off the interest.
