I got a Yento soup, a James beans, and Howdy, hold the duty. Honey, come on.\n\nI'm sorry. I didn't I don't mind paying my dues. You know?

Just, one other thing.\n\nYes. I, I work at Bloomingdale's, and I might know of a job possibility if you're if you're interested. Do you want my pickle? Hey, guys. Hey, Gunther.\n\nHi. I mean, you're going out of a date with the noisy guy upstairs? Well, he's very charming. I know he's too charming, but if you 2 start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him. Well, you're just going to have to Try.\n\nOkay. Joey, where are the Jell O shots? I don't know. Chandler was supposed to be passing them or Chandler. Hello, Lowe.\n\nOh, somebody's feeling better. Stick out your tongue. Take off your shirt. Oh my god. My god.\n\nHow many of these did you have? These are pure vodka. Go. Yep. Jello just like mom used to make.\n\nThe most unbelievable thing happened to me today. Hi. Hi. So I'm having lunch at Monica's, and this guy starts talking to me. And it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's, and there happens to be an opening in his department.\n\nSo I gave him my phone number, and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview. Wow. I know. Wow. What?\n\nSo this guy is helping you for no apparent reason? And he's, he's a total stranger? Yeah. His name is, Mark something. Sounds like Mark something wants to have some sex.\n\nWhat? Oh, I'm I'm just saying. I mean, why else would he just, know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason. To be nice? Hey, Joey.\n\nAre men ever nice to strange women for no reason? No. Only for sex. Thank you. So did you, did you tell Mark something about me?\n\nI didn't have to because I was wearing my Iheart raw sandwich board and ringing my bell. Okay. How many of that girl are you seeing? How hammered are you? These these are Joey's sisters.\n\nCheers. Hi, Joyce. Sisters. Hey. Hey.\n\nWhat are we drinking over here? Oh, well, I have, Vodka and cranberry juice. No kidding. That's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband. Wow.\n\nOh, k. I don't know how to talk to you. What you doing? I'm checking my ex girlfriend off my speed dialer. No.\n\nNo. No. No. It's a good thing. Why must we die so spilly anyway?\n\nWhy must we rush through life? Why can't we Savor the precious moments. Those are some huge bets you have. Hi. Hi.\n\nYeah. So, I I heard about this, Mark guy that, Rachel met today. Oh, yeah. Isn't that great? Oh, yeah.\n\nSo, yeah, Pretty pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy. He is, and he is so dreamy. I mean, you know what? When he left, I actually used the phrase, Hamina.\n\nHamina. That's excellent. So he's just a nice guy. Do you really think this mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping you? Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but, you know, that's true of any job.\n\nUh-oh. Uh-oh. How are you feeling? Well, my apartment isn't there anymore because I drank it. Where'd you get to?\n\nWe lost you after you opened up all the presents. Yeah. Yeah. I ended up in the storage room and Not alone. Woo hoo.\n\nNo woohooing. No woohooing. Why? What happened? I fooled around with Joey's sister.\n\nWell, that's not the worst part. What is the worst part? I can't remember which sister. You see what men do? Don't tell me men are nice.\n\nThis is man. Are you insane? I mean, Joey's gonna kill you. He's actually going to kill you dead. Okay.\n\nYou don't think I thought of that? How can you not know which one? I mean, it's unbelievable. I mean, was it Gina? Which one is Gina?\n\nThe dark big hair with the airplane earrings. No. No. No. That's not Gina.\n\nThat's Dina. Oh, you see? You can't tell which is which either. We didn't fool around with any of them. Yeah.\n\nBlah. Veronica. Look. It's gotta be Veronica, the girl in the red Good. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.\n\nThat was me. Oh, look. When I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get a little overly friendly, and I'm I'm sorry. That's okay. That's alright.\n\nThat's okay. Can I talk to you for a second? Hey, Julie. Come on. Why can't we talk in here with witnesses?\n\nI just got off the phone with my sister. Which which one? Mary Angela. Mary Angela. Yeah.\n\nNo. Which one is she again? Why don't you ask Chandler? Because he's the one who fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her.\n\nNow is that true, or you're just getting over Janice by groping my sister. It's gotta be the first one. Really? That's great.
