How do you think Joey's gonna react when he finds out you blew sister with a letter. Well, that's the part where you tell them that I moved to France when, actually, I'll be in Cuba. Right. Look.\n\nLook. You've got to do this yourself, okay, in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary Angela. Okay?\n\nWhen whichever one she gets comes to the door, you take her for a walk. You let her down easy. Okay. What if Maryangela comes to the door and I ask for Maryangel? We're in Cuba.\n\nTroy, what what, what what what are you doing here? Waiting for my grandma to finish my laundry. What about you? I'm, I'm here to see Mary Angela. You are so the man.\n\nNow look. Listen. Listen. You gotta be cool because my grandma doesn't know about you 2 yet, and you do not wanna tick her off. She was like the 6th person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.\n\nWhere are your parents? Oh, they're in Vermont buying cigarettes. Where's Mary Angelo? She's right in there. I can't believe Mark didn't call.\n\nIt's Sunday night, and he didn't call. Bummer. Yeah. Right. Look at you.\n\nYou're practically giddy. No. I'm genuinely sorry. The Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.\n\nWait a minute. Why don't you just call Mark? I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him? You've got to make Stuff happened. Yeah.\n\nBut you you don't wanna seem too pushy. Honey, it's not pushies. He gave her his home number. What? He gave you his phone number as in, like, to to his home?\n\nYeah. And you don't mind if I call because you only want good things for me. That's right. Good things. That that is what I too.\n\nHello, Mark? Hi. It's Rachel Green. Oh, no. Don't you apologize.\n\nI yeah. I'll hold. He left my number at work. He was gonna get it, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers. That is so made up.\n\nYep. Oh my god. Tomorrow. That no. It's perfect.\n\nOh god. Thank you so much. Great. Bye. I got the interview.\n\nOh, yay. There you go. He even offered to meet me for lunch and prep me for it. Oh, that is amazing. Yeah.\n\nWell, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less. I gotta figure out what I'm gonna wear. High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro. Yeah. Right.\n\nOkay. I'll see you guys later. You go get them. What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?\n\nWhy don't you call him? Well, thank you very much. You know? Now he's gonna prep her. You know?\n\nPrep her as in what you do before you surgically remove the boyfriend. Are you crazy? Am I? Am I? Am I out of my mind?\n\nAm I losing my senses? This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal. Ross, you know, this isn't even about you. I mean, this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. Me you know, even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her?\n\nDoes that mean he gets to? No, ma'am. I mean, don't you trust her? Well, Yeah. Think get over yourself.\n\nGrow up. You grow 1. This tiramisu is is is excellent. Did you make it, Maryangela? No.\n\nI did. It it it's yummy. So, Maryangela, Do you like it? Of course. It's a favorite.\n\nSo, Mary Angela, What's your 2nd favorite? More grandma's tiramisu. Oh, would you just, please? Give me the recipe because this is great. It's top notch.\n\nGrabbed eyes with me. So will I. Excuse yourself and go to the bathroom. Oh, no. No.\n\nNo. I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything. Just do it. Will you excuse me?\n\nI have to, True. Henson. Finally. I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something?\n\nI have not stopped thinking about you since the party. Look. I may have jumped the gun here. I just got out of a relationship, and I'm not really in a in a commitment kind of place. Sue, me neither.\n\nGod. Mary Angela was right. You do have the softest lips. You're not Mary Angela? No.\n\nI'm married to Reese. This is so bad. If if you're not Mary Angela, then, then who is? I am. Oh, it's so bad.\n\nJoey. No, Joey. No, Joey. No, Joey. Joey.\n\nWhat's going on? You're it. Now run and hide. It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissing me because he thought I was Mary Angela.\n\nWhat? How could you do that? How could you think she was Mary Angela? I wasn't sure which one Mary Angela was. Look.\n\nI'm sorry. Okay? I was really drunk, and you guys all look really similar. I say punch him, Joey. Yeah.\n\nYeah. I'm shaking. No. You know what? We should all calm down because, you know, brother's not gonna punch me.\n\nYeah? Well, that is usually what I would do, but I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this? Hey. Where'd everybody go?\n\nHey. No. No. Why don't you go into the den? I think cops is on.\n\nJoey, if you wanna punch me, go ahead. I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family. You're my best friend, and I would never do anything like this ever again. So what?\n\nI say punch him. Yeah. Punch him. No. No.\n\nNo. I'm not gonna punch Chandler. I'll do it. No. You won't.\n\nLook. He knows he did a terrible thing, and I believe him. He's sorry. But you got one more apology to make. Alright?\n\nYou gotta apologize To Mary Angelo. Okay. Absolutely. Alright. Cookie, now you can punch.\n\nWhat? Hey. Hi. What are you doing here? You know, this, building's on my paper route.\n\nSo, hi. Hi. How'd it go? Oh, well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but, you know, thank god Mark coached me because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up. I'm so proud of you.\n\nMe too. Listen. I'm, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous, and it's just I like it a lot. So I know. Yeah?\n\nYeah. Rachel. Yeah. Hi. Hi, Mark.\n\nHi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it. You got the job. I did?\n\nYes. Oh my god. Congratulations. So, Phoebe, how was your date? Oh, well, you know.\n\nYeah. I do know. Ugh. You were eavesdropping? Eavesdropping.\n\nPheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down. Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy, and I think he Really happens to like me. Maybe he's just Jumping on a pogo stick, and it really likes it. Maybe the pogo stick likes it too.\n\nAlright. That's it. He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is gonna get the butt kicking of a lifetime. But is he a big guy?\n\nWe're all good. Come on. Well, I see. I just got beat up by a girl. Then Amy.\n\nThanks, you guys. Thank you. Don't worry. I hope they kick his ass.
