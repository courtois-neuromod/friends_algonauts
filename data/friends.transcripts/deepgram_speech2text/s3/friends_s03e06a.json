Who of the 6 of you has slept with who of the 6 of you? Wow. It's like a dirty math problem. I'm sorry.\n\nThe answer there would be None of us. Yeah. And you know what? If that doesn't change soon, I'm gonna dump you for somebody who puts out. No.\n\nCome on. Over the years? None of you ever got, you know, drunk and stupid? Well, that's really a different question. I'm sorry.\n\nI find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies? There there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together. Okay. What? Excuse me.\n\nThere was no time. Okay. But let's say there was. How might that go? Okay.\n\nOkay. Well, then answer me this. Have any of you ever almost? Oh, that So unfortunate. What?\n\nCute naked guy is really starting to put on weight. Okay. I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe, I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone. You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.\n\nOh, then it must have been you? Bye. Bye bye. That's why I moved out. Hey.\n\nNow while we're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore? I think on some level, Oh, she already knows. Phoebe, she doesn't know that you sneak out every night. She doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living at your grandmother's for a week now. Okay.\n\nWell, maybe not on those levels. You have got to tell her. Okay? The longer you wait, the harder it's gonna be on her. You're right.\n\nYou're right. Anyway, listen. Tonight's bag is really bulky. So could you sneak some stuff out for me? It's just like a clock radio and some cemetery dirt.\n\nHey. I'm never gonna find a roommate ever? Well, nobody good? Well, let's see. There was the guy with the ferrets.\n\nThat's plural. Spitter. Oh, oh, and, yes, the guy who enjoyed my name so much, he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing. Bing.\n\nGreat apartment, Chandler Bing. Bing. So how many more do you have tomorrow? 2. This photographer who seemed really dull and this actor guy Who I'm not sure about because, when he called and I answered the phone, Chandler Bing, he said, woah.\n\nShort message. Ross, put on the floor, or come over no more? Sir, your dresser is missing, but this she notices. What? I have to go.\n\nYeah. Carol should be home by now. So, How's it going with you guys? Well, better, actually. You know?\n\nI I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately. Oh, really? Yeah. You know how I have you guys? Well, she doesn't have any close friends that are just hers.\n\nBut last week, she met this woman at the gym, Susan something, And they really hit it off, and I I think it's gonna make a difference. So, Eric, What kind of photography, do you do? Oh, mostly fashion. So there may be models here from time to time. I hope that's cool.\n\nYes. It is cool, because I have models here, you know, Never. What else? Yeah. During the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, Which you are welcome to use, by the way.\n\nAlthough I should probably tell you she's a porn star. Well, listen. I, still have 1 more person to, meet. But unless it turns out to be your sister, I think your chances are pretty good. Alright.\n\nBedroom, bathroom, living room. This right here is Kitchen, and, thanks for coming by. Bye bye. Don't you, don't you wanna ask me any questions? Sure.\n\nWhat's up? Well, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I, I got my own TV.
