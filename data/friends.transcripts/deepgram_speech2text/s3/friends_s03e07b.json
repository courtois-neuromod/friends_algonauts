So if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, Take a pair of tweezers and just start pulling.\n\nOkay. Or, or let's say I wanna convey that I've, just done something evil. Well, that would be your basic. I've got a fishhook in my eyebrow, and I like it. Yeah.\n\nOkay. Let's say I've just gotten bad news, but all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight, everybody. Class dismissed.\n\nHey, mister Tripp. Hey. Guess what? I got an audition. Oh, one of my students got an audition.\n\nI'm so proud. I was wondering If you would consider coaching me for it. Oh, you bet. What's the part? Oh, it's great to roll in all my children.\n\nNick the boxer. You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just up. 4%. Okay?\n\nI tip more than that when there's a bug in my food. Ross, tonight was about the 2 of you getting along. Ugh. Would you just see my chiropractor already? Yeah.\n\nI'm gonna go to a doctor who went to medical school on a mini mall. Hey, Pheebs. What are you doing? I'm freaking out. Monica kinda trusted me with something, and she shouldn't have.\n\nAlright. I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn the lights on in her bedroom? Yeah. I am so dead.\n\nAlright. Look. Here's the bottom line, Ross. This is fixable if we act fast. Okay?\n\nSo I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow, and you can make nice. Look. Honey, I have tried to make nice. It doesn't work. Okay.\n\nLook, Ross. I realized that my father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here. Look, sweetie. I could be the bigger man. I could be the biggest man.\n\nI could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your father up and say, like me. Like me, tiny doctor. Okay. Well, can't you just try it one more time, Ross? For me.\n\nFor me. Rachel, one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it. Okay? We're never gonna get along.\n\nOkay. Well, you are just going to have to. Okay? Because I've already got a mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together. Okay?\n\nI don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too. Okay. Okay. I'll get the bagels. What's this?\n\nIsn't it cool? Vroom. Vroom. This is not the bed I ordered. I know.\n\nYou must have won, like, a contest or something. Voila. Baby. Why is this car in my bedroom? I'm sorry.\n\nOkay? I I wasn't looking, and the Store said that they won't take it back because you've signed for it. When did I sign for it? When I was you. You you know what?\n\nIt's all Joey's fault. He left his nose open. Did you make brownies today? Not back. Quick.\n\nTake off your dress. You won't notice the bed. Hey. I'm going for sushi. Does anybody want, Woah.\n\nSomebody missed the off ramp. It's Monica's bed. What? Okay. It's a race car.\n\nSo this has always been Monica's bed. Well, you're just noticing now how self involved are you? Okay. Well, if this bed isn't new, then how come there's plastic on the mattress? Sometimes I have bad dreams.\n\nLook. I just saw my best friend's brain smeared across the canvas. It's not gonna be me. Not me. Wow.\n\nThat was good. That was Tweezers? No. Oh, wow. It's really good.\n\nThanks. Any suggestions? You told him to play the boxer gay? Well, I might have said super gay. Joey, the last time an actor did something this bad, a president died.\n\nLincoln, Booth. Something happened at the tunnel? Joy, you're this guy's teacher. I mean, how could you do this? Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I I really, really want this pod.\n\nWell, if you really, really want it, then it's okay. Hi, daddy. Baby. Ross? Doctor Green, how are you?\n\nThanks for dinner last night. Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. Nice hair. What'd you do? Swim here?\n\nOkay. That's it. I can't take it anymore. What? What?\n\nHe's interested in you. He he likes your hair, and he Just wants to know how you got here. Oh, please. Sweetie, it's hopeless. Okay?\n\nI'm just gonna go. What? Look. I'm sorry. It's just Rush, What's with the neck?\n\nHe's got this thing, and I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor. You're still going to that chiropractic? That man couldn't get into med school in Ex Toppa. Thank you. That's what I keep saying.\n\nExcuse me. Doctor Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor. Oh, Wait a minute. His name is doctor Bobby? Well, that's his last name.\n\nAnd his first name. He's Bobby Bobby? It's Robert Bobby, and, excuse me. He helps me. Please ask her how.\n\nWhy do you need help for? With my alignment. I got one leg shorter than the other. Oh my god. Argue with that.\n\nWhat? It's true. My right leg is 2 inches shorter. Come on. You're just tilting.\n\nHer legs are fine. I know that. So what do you let her go to a chiropractor for? Sorry. Let her?\n\nWhat can I do? She doesn't listen to me about, about renter's insurance either. Wait a minute. You don't have renter's insurance? No.\n\nBut what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg short on the other. Hey. Would you, would you like some juice? With you.\n\nOkay. Wow. This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?\n\nYeah, honey. I'm standing right there. Why don't you just tell them about the mole I haven't gotten checked yet? Excellent. There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.\n\nI had such an opportunity in the recent present, and I'm ashamed to say that I took it. I advised a fellow actor to play a role, Homosexuality. Yeah. We both auditioned for the part, And, as it turned out, they, They like the stupid gay thing and cast him. Now He's got a 2 year contract opposite Susan Lucci, The 1st lady of daytime television.\n\nMe me, I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be haunting. I'm I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Thank you.\n\nMay I help you? Yes. Hi. I talked to you on the phone. I'm the lady who Stuck with the race car bed?\n\nLook. It's like I told you. There's nothing I can do. You signed for it. Monica Falula Geller.\n\nAlright, Chester man. Look. We're gonna see the king. Nobody sees the king. Okay.\n\nI'm talking to the king. Hey.
