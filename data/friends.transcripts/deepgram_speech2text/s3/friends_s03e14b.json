Where's your leg?\n\nI mean, I'm the smallest person in the world, aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world. What is it? Actually, he is the smallest person in the world. Heard about the leg burning, It came up.\n\nListen. I, I know it's a long shot, but by any chance, did she find that funny? So I nodded off a little. Knotted off? Ross, you were snoring.\n\nMy father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks. Come on. 45 minutes. 45 minutes, the man talked about strappy back dresses. Well, okay.\n\nHow about 4 hours in a breezing museum auditorium listening to professor Pittsteins in his, hey, everybody. Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years?

No.\n\nNo. I don't think so. Good. It's just like anything else. You just have to get used to it.\n\nWhat's that? That's that's my nubbin. What's a nubbin? It's kind of a, a third nipple kind of thing. Do you have 3 nipples?\n\nWell, you know, 2 regulars, and, one that barely qualifies as what? Nothing. And I I just remembered I have to leave. You, You have to you have to leave now? How come?\n\nOh, well, it's nubbin. Nothing. But I'm I'm I'll see you later. Okay. By who?\n\nI thought you were coming. Where where were you? Come here. Come here. Okay.\n\nDon't get mad. Okay? K. Don't give me a reason to get mad. Okay.\n\nI played smelly cat for the people of my old ad agency. They went nuts. No. Look. I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just you big fat did it anyway.\n\nOh, good. You know what?

You know what?\n\nYou have to choose. Alright? If if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing, then okay. You can have smelly cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?\n\nProblem order in the litter box? Don't change your kitty. Change your kitty litter. Sorry, thieves. Yeah.\n\nYou okay? Yeah. I actually am. Yeah. Because you know, life's life's gonna hand you all kinds of stuff.\n\nYou know, you learn your little lessons, and hopefully, you grow. Wanna hear a new song? Yeah. I'd love to. Okay.\n\nOkay. Jingle bitch screwed me over. Go to hell, Yeah. That's all I have so far. Well, hello.\n\nWhere have you been? The doctor. Is everything okay? Oh, yes. Just had me a little nubbinectomy.\n\nYep. Two nipples, no waiting. Wow. Just like Rachel in high school. What?\n\nCome on. I was kidding. It was such an obvious joke. That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it.
