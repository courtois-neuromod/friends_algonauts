Oh, That was only because I used the red one to unclog the drain. Mine is the red one.\n\nOh god. Can open worms everywhere? Hey. Why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same Soap. Because soap is soap.\n\nIt's self cleaning. Alright. Well, next time you take a shower, Think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash. Hey. Hey.\n\nOh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion? Well, you know the guy on my show that's in a coma? He's having a brunch. Okay.\n\nReady when you are. Okey doke. I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.

My dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke. No.\n\nI think you should tell them. No. I don't even know how Serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling him anything. I don't know.\n\nI don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, God. I hope they get together. Hello? Okay.\n\nCome on, bro. Guys. See you. See you. Okay.\n\nOh, bye you. Bye. Bye, you. K. Here we go.\n\nHere we go. Here we go. Here we go. Okay. Wait.\n\nWait. Wait. Wait. It's gonna be fine. How can you say that?\n\nAre you not nervous? I'm terrified. This is just a very absorbent suit. Alright. Shall we, Monica?\n\nNo. You know what? Ross, let's let's switch places. You get in the middle. No.\n\nYou know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up. Monica, Monica, you could come in Craddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. We're here. Oh, hi. Hey.\n\nHi, John. Happy birthday, dad. Awesome. Have you. Hi.\n\nHappy birthday. So you kids thank doctor Burke for the ride. Oh, actually, mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us. So you kids take the train in? No.\n\nRichard Byrd gave them a ride. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20 year old Twinkie in the city. Finger cramp. Oh, god. Sorry.\n\nHere. Let me get that, mom. So Richard's shopping in the junior section. Are we still on that? We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.\n\nShe's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up. Can you believe this place? I know. This is a great apartment. Oh, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you.\n\nSo when you're in there, it's like you're peeing with the Katz. There's my fantasy come true. No. Seriously. Hey.\n\nHey. We were just saying, great apartment, man. Thanks. You want it? Yeah.\n\nI'm moving to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one. Yeah. Can you see me in a place like this? Why not?\n\nYou hate park views and high ceilings? Come on. I'll show you the kitchen. Oh, that's alright, fellas. I saw Kitchen this morning on TV.\n\nStop talking. Okay. Come on. Tell us. Yeah.\n\nIs she really 20? I am not telling you guys anything. Come on, Rich. It's my My birthday. Let me live vicariously.\n\nDan, you really don't wanna do that. What's a little midlife crisis between friends? Jack, Would you let it go? Look. I know what you're going through.\n\nWhen I turned 50, I got the Porsche. You, you got your own little speedster. Guys, seriously, it is not like that. Tell you what. Maybe one of these weekends, you can borrow the car, And I Ted, I beg you not to finish that set.\n\nWhat? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche. Okay, Rach. Which which lily?\n\nThis lily or that lily? Well, I I like this lily. It's more open. You know? And that's like my mom.\n\nShe had a more open, giving spirit. Oh, Foghorn Leghorn. Hi. Blonde girl, you're in room 2. Not so blonde girl, you're with me.\n\nHere we go. Uh-huh. You're not going. Uh-huh. What?\n\nIs it is this because of what Ross said? No. Well, yeah. Maybe. I don't believe this.\n\nIs this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss? I mean, come on. What is this? It's 1922.\n\nWhat's 1922? Just, you know, a long time ago. When men used to tell women what to do a lot. And then there was suffrage, which was a good thing, but it sounds horrible. Do you wanna get this tattoo?\n\nYes. I do. It's just that Ross is Okay. Hey. Hey.\n\nIs your boyfriend the boss of you? No. Okay. Who is the boss of you? You?\n\nNo. You are the boss of you. Now you march your hiney in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. Go. I haven't even gotten my tattoo yet, and I'm already tougher.\n\nHow you doing? I'm a Twinkie. Really? I'm a hero. This is so hard.\n\nYeah. I know. I hate it too. Look. Maybe we should just tell him.\n\nMaybe we should just tell your parents first. My parents are dead. God. You were so lucky. I mean, look at him on me.\n\nOh, I know. Just hang in there. Okay? Okay. I'll go out first.\n\nAlright? Alright. Bye. Judy, going to the bathroom. Good for you.\n\nThank you, Richard. I appreciate the support. Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon killer rhubarb? Bob doesn't believe I have one.\n\nI have no idea. Did you know Richard has a Twinkie in the city? I know he's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon. I just never would've Pictured Richard with a bimbo.\n\nApparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her. Really? I tell you, I've never seen him this happy. So, Zach, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?\n\nOf course not. With you, it's like I've got 2 25 year olds. Oh, Dax. Stop. Come on.\n\nIt's my birthday. Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment. Oh, please. I saw the way you were checking out his moldings.\n\nYou want it. Why would I want another apartment? I've already got an apartment that I love. Well, Well, it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while. Alright.\n\nYou want the truth? I'm thinking about it. What? I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old.\n\nI've never lived alone, and I'm Finally at a place where I got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore. Woah. Woah. Woah. I don't need a roommate either.\n\nOkay. I can afford to live here by myself. You know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware. What are you getting so bent out of shape for? It's not like we agreed to live together forever.\n\nWe're not Bert and Ernie. I'm aware that we're not gay puppets. Alright. Look. You know what?\n\nIf this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it. Well, that's how I feel. Well, then maybe you should take it. Well, then maybe I will. Fine with me.\n\nGreat. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, The spoons. Whose drink can I freshen? Almost time for cake. Mom?\n\nAre you okay?
