Hey. Hey. So how is Joan? Broke up with her. Oh, hi. Don't tell me. Because of the big nostril thing? They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them. Come on. They were not that huge. I'm telling you, she leaned back. I could see Her brain. How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial, insignificant Hold it. Hold it. I mean, I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple times with this girl, really hot, great, kiss her, but She had the biggest Adam's apple. Wanna be nuts. You or me? I got it. Joey, women don't have Adam's apples. You guys are messing with me. Right? Yes. I am. We are. That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, Woah. So you name 1 woman that you broke up with for an actual real reason. Maureen Rizzilo. Because she doesn't hate Yanni is not a real reason. Hello, mister Heckles. You're doing it again. We're not doing anything. You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds. You don't have birds. I could have birds. Okay, mister Hackles. We'll try to keep it down. Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party. Alright. Bye bye. Okay, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky. Yeah. We'll give you Janice. I miss Janice, though. Hello, Chandler Bing. Oh my Good. Oh, Chandler. Now. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. Faster. Stop with the broom. We're not making noise. We won. We did good. Oh. Mister Heckles. How did this happen? He must've been sweeping. They found a broom in his hand. Oh, dear god. That's terrible. I know. I was sweeping yesterday. Could've been me. She's waiting. Right. You never know. Never know. K. It's very faint, but I can still him in the building. Go into the light, mister Heckle. Okay, Phoebe. I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. Really need help. Here we go. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there are a lot of things out there that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true. Mhmm. Such as? Like, crop circles or the Bermuda Triangle or evolution? Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah. Well, you don't, you don't believe in evolution? No. Not really. You don't believe in evolution? I don't know. It's just, you know, monkeys, Darwin. You know, it's a it's a nice story. I just think it's a little too easy. Too easy. Too the process of every living thing on this Planet evolving over 1000000 of years from single celled organisms is is too easy. Yeah. I just don't buy it. Excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, Like like like the air we breathe, like gravity. Oh, okay. Don't get me started on gravity. You, you don't believe in gravity? Well, it's not so much that, you know, like, I don't believe in it. You know? It's Just I don't know. Lately, I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed. Uh-oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed. Good, Pheebs. Up on the ceiling. Oh, there she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is mister Buddy Boyle, Heckle's attorney. He'd like to talk to you. Okay. What can we do for you? Alright, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave All his earthly possessions to the, noisy girls in the apartment above mine. Oh. Well, what about his family? He didn't have any. Woah. Oh, okay. So let's talk money. Alright. There was none. Now let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number 1. You be noisy girl number 2. I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life without even knowing it? Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This was his final revenge. Ever seen so much crap? Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap. Check this out. Can I have this? How can you not believe in evolution? I don't know. Just, look at this funky shirt. Pheebs, I have studied Evolution my entire adult life. Okay? And I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show The evolution of different species. Okay? I mean, you can you can literally see them evolving through time. Really? You can actually see it? You bet. In in, the US, China, Africa, all over. See, I didn't know that. Well, there you go. So now the real question is, who put those fossils there and why? Hey. Look at this. My big book of grievances. Hey. There's me. April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes home with a date. Yeah. Hey, Chandler. Look. You're in here too. April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate brings home dry cleaning. Well, that's excellent. Monica. Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this. Rach, I think we have enough regular lamps. What? Oh, come on. I mean, it's it's not like a it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, Which by the way, I also think is really cool. Like, it doesn't go with any of my stuff. Well, what about my stuff? You don't have any stuff. This will be the start of my stuff. No. We still think of it as your apartment, don't you? No. Yes. You do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just someone who rents a room. Okay. While you on that for a while, I'm gonna go find a place for my new land. Okay, Pheebs. How I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs? Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their Spacecraft. Please tell me you're joking. Look. Can't we just say that you believe in something and I don't? No. No. No, Phoebes. We can't. Okay? Because it's like math. 1 plus 1 equals 2. I can't stand by and let you think that 1 plus one Might equal 3 or 4 or yellow. Why not? Now what's that all about? What is this obsessive need you have to make everybody agree with you? You know what? I think I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope. Is there blood coming out of my ears? Check it out. Check it out. Heckels' high school yearbook. Oh. Wow. He looks so normal. Yeah. He's even kinda cute. Heckles, you cracked me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school. Funniest? Heckles? That's what it says. Wow. Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that? I'd call that excessive. Woah. What? Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool. Joan, you're both dorks. Big deal. I just think it's weird. You know? Heckles and me heckles and me, me Me and Heckles. Hey. Would you knock it off? Have you been here all night? Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud. Too smart. Makes noise when she eats. This is this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone just like he did. Chandler, Heckles was a nut case. Our trains are on the same track. Okay. Yeah. Sure. I'm coming up 30 years behind her, but the stops are all the same.

Hey. Hey. So how is Joan? Broke up with her.\n\nOh, hi. Don't tell me. Because of the big nostril thing? They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.\n\nCome on. They were not that huge. I'm telling you, she leaned back. I could see Her brain. How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial, insignificant Hold it.\n\nHold it. I mean, I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple times with this girl, really hot, great, kiss her, but She had the biggest Adam's apple. Wanna be nuts. You or me?\n\nI got it. Joey, women don't have Adam's apples. You guys are messing with me. Right? Yes.\n\nI am. We are. That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, Woah. So you name 1 woman that you broke up with for an actual real reason.\n\nMaureen Rizzilo. Because she doesn't hate Yanni is not a real reason. Hello, mister Heckles. You're doing it again. We're not doing anything.\n\nYou're stomping. It's disturbing my birds. You don't have birds. I could have birds. Okay, mister Hackles.\n\nWe'll try to keep it down. Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party. Alright. Bye bye.\n\nOkay, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky. Yeah.\n\nWe'll give you Janice. I miss Janice, though. Hello, Chandler Bing. Oh my Good. Oh, Chandler.\n\nNow. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. Faster.\n\nStop with the broom. We're not making noise. We won. We did good. Oh.\n\nMister Heckles. How did this happen? He must've been sweeping. They found a broom in his hand. Oh, dear god.\n\nThat's terrible. I know. I was sweeping yesterday. Could've been me. She's waiting.\n\nRight. You never know. Never know. K. It's very faint, but I can still him in the building.\n\nGo into the light, mister Heckle. Okay, Phoebe. I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. Really need help. Here we go.\n\nThat's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there are a lot of things out there that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true. Mhmm. Such as?\n\nLike, crop circles or the Bermuda Triangle or evolution? Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah.\n\nWell, you don't, you don't believe in evolution? No. Not really. You don't believe in evolution? I don't know.\n\nIt's just, you know, monkeys, Darwin. You know, it's a it's a nice story. I just think it's a little too easy. Too easy. Too the process of every living thing on this Planet evolving over 1000000 of years from single celled organisms is is too easy.\n\nYeah. I just don't buy it. Excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, Like like like the air we breathe, like gravity.\n\nOh, okay. Don't get me started on gravity. You, you don't believe in gravity? Well, it's not so much that, you know, like, I don't believe in it. You know?\n\nIt's Just I don't know. Lately, I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed. Uh-oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed. Good, Pheebs.\n\nUp on the ceiling. Oh, there she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is mister Buddy Boyle, Heckle's attorney. He'd like to talk to you.\n\nOkay. What can we do for you? Alright, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave All his earthly possessions to the, noisy girls in the apartment above mine.\n\nOh. Well, what about his family? He didn't have any. Woah. Oh, okay.\n\nSo let's talk money. Alright. There was none. Now let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number 1.\n\nYou be noisy girl number 2. I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life without even knowing it? Would you look at this dump? He hated us.\n\nThis was his final revenge. Ever seen so much crap? Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap. Check this out. Can I have this?\n\nHow can you not believe in evolution? I don't know. Just, look at this funky shirt. Pheebs, I have studied Evolution my entire adult life. Okay?\n\nAnd I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show The evolution of different species. Okay? I mean, you can you can literally see them evolving through time. Really? You can actually see it?\n\nYou bet. In in, the US, China, Africa, all over. See, I didn't know that. Well, there you go. So now the real question is, who put those fossils there and why?\n\nHey. Look at this. My big book of grievances. Hey. There's me.\n\nApril 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes home with a date. Yeah. Hey, Chandler.\n\nLook. You're in here too. April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate brings home dry cleaning. Well, that's excellent.\n\nMonica. Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this. Rach, I think we have enough regular lamps.\n\nWhat? Oh, come on. I mean, it's it's not like a it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, Which by the way, I also think is really cool. Like, it doesn't go with any of my stuff. Well, what about my stuff?\n\nYou don't have any stuff. This will be the start of my stuff. No. We still think of it as your apartment, don't you? No.\n\nYes. You do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just someone who rents a room. Okay. While you on that for a while, I'm gonna go find a place for my new land.\n\nOkay, Pheebs. How I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs? Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their Spacecraft.\n\nPlease tell me you're joking. Look. Can't we just say that you believe in something and I don't? No. No.\n\nNo, Phoebes. We can't. Okay? Because it's like math. 1 plus 1 equals 2.\n\nI can't stand by and let you think that 1 plus one Might equal 3 or 4 or yellow. Why not? Now what's that all about? What is this obsessive need you have to make everybody agree with you? You know what?\n\nI think I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope. Is there blood coming out of my ears? Check it out. Check it out. Heckels' high school yearbook.\n\nOh. Wow. He looks so normal. Yeah. He's even kinda cute.\n\nHeckles, you cracked me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school. Funniest? Heckles? That's what it says.\n\nWow. Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that? I'd call that excessive.\n\nWoah. What? Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool. Joan, you're both dorks.\n\nBig deal. I just think it's weird. You know? Heckles and me heckles and me, me Me and Heckles. Hey.\n\nWould you knock it off? Have you been here all night? Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them.\n\nVivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud. Too smart. Makes noise when she eats.\n\nThis is this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone just like he did. Chandler, Heckles was a nut case. Our trains are on the same track.\n\nOkay. Yeah. Sure. I'm coming up 30 years behind her, but the stops are all the same.
