They sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case, it's actually kinda true. Oh, that's him. Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet. Phoebe? Yes. Hi, mister Edelman. Nice to see you. Hi. Thanks for meeting me. Oh, that's alright. Although you did cut into my very busy day of sitting. Oh, Oh, do you wanna sit? Oh, no. No. No. Please. I spent most of midmorning trying to stand up. Now, what can I do for you, my dear? Oh, okay. I don't know how to say this, but, I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it, kind of stuck around in me. You're saying my wife is in you? Yeah. Okay. You don't have to believe me, but, Can you think of any unfinished business she might have had? Like, any reason she'd be hanging around? Well, I don't know what to tell you, dear. The only thing I could think of is that She always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything. Everything? Everything. Woah. That's a lot of stuff. Wait. I I I remember. She also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time. I'm sorry. There's laughing in my head. Worth a shot, Look at this. These are all Halloween 3 3 years ago. My little Martini. I love your olive head. Oh, and look. Here's Barry. Oh, did he have to come straight from the office? No. That was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, But he came as a regular dentist.

Actually, what I think you said was don't touch that and get the hell out of my kitchen. Really? Weird. Anyway see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. Turns out I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it. Hey, Mon. You want some help? If you want. Hey. Hey. Hey. What a day. Oh, I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty. She's still with you? Yes. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back. She has to go to the bathroom again.

I'm dicing. I'm dicing. I don't hear anything. I I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking There might be more. Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. Alright. Alright. I mean, god, you just come You drop this bomb on me before you even tell daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?

You didn't marry your berry, honey, but I married mine. Oh. Alright, people. We're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move. Move. Move. Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles. Joey, speed it up. I'm sorry. It's the pigs. They're reluctant to get in the blankets. Monica, how did this happen?

Alright. Look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you. I do.

How come I'm stuck dicing when he gets to ball a melon? Hi. Hi. How's it going? Oh, it's going great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers. Yeah. That's Fine. Whatever. What's the matter? Nothing. Okay. Everything. Think we're calling off the wedding. What? You're still gonna pay me. Right? Or something a little less selfish. Carol, what's the matter? What happened? My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming. Oh my god. I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but but they're my parents. I mean, they're supposed to give me away and everything. Okay. I'm sorry. And when Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and then she said, we're not doing this for them. We're doing it for us. And if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do. I, can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right. You do? Look. Do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this. Of course, I do. Well, then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look. I mean, If my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would've stopped me. Right? Look. This is your wedding. Do it. You're right. Of course, you're right. So we're back on? We're back on. You heard the woman? Peel chop. Devil. Can't believe I lost 2 minutes. Just seems so futile. You know? All these women and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers. You know? I have the cape, And yet I cannot fly. Well, now you understand how I feel every single day. Okay? The world Butterscotch? No one? Alright. You'll be sorry later. Thank you. Anytime. Ross. You know, nothing makes god happier than when 2 people, any 2 people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony. Oh my god. Now I've seen everything. Woah. She's gone. She's gone. She's gone. Go ahead. Get married. Go. Would you look at them? Yeah. Can't help but. How's that pig in the blanket working out for you? I wrapped those bad boys. I miss Rose. Oh, yeah? I know it's kinda weird, but, I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and I don't know. I just feel kind of alone. You know, I, couldn't help overhearing what you just said, and, I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life. How about we go get you a drink? Okay. So nice. I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line. Right? Hey, mom. You haven't how am I? I just danced with a wonderfully large woman, and 3 other girls Made eyes at me over at the buffet.

I mean, they're supposed to give me away and everything. Okay.\n\nI'm sorry. And when Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and then she said, we're not doing this for them. We're doing it for us. And if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.\n\nI, can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right. You do? Look. Do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.\n\nOf course, I do. Well, then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look. I mean, If my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would've stopped me.\n\nRight? Look. This is your wedding. Do it. You're right.\n\nOf course, you're right. So we're back on? We're back on. You heard the woman? Peel chop.\n\nDevil. Can't believe I lost 2 minutes. Just seems so futile. You know? All these women and nothing.\n\nI feel like Superman without my powers. You know? I have the cape, And yet I cannot fly. Well, now you understand how I feel every single day. Okay?\n\nThe world Butterscotch? No one? Alright. You'll be sorry later. Thank you.\n\nAnytime. Ross. You know, nothing makes god happier than when 2 people, any 2 people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony. Oh my god.\n\nNow I've seen everything. Woah. She's gone. She's gone. She's gone.\n\nGo ahead. Get married. Go. Would you look at them? Yeah.\n\nCan't help but. How's that pig in the blanket working out for you? I wrapped those bad boys. I miss Rose. Oh, yeah?\n\nI know it's kinda weird, but, I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and I don't know. I just feel kind of alone. You know, I, couldn't help overhearing what you just said, and, I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life. How about we go get you a drink? Okay.\n\nSo nice. I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line. Right? Hey, mom. You haven't how am I?\n\nI just danced with a wonderfully large woman, and 3 other girls Made eyes at me over at the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options. There's more alcohol. Right? How you doing?\n\nOkay. You did a good thing today. You wanna dance? No. That's fine.\n\nCome on. I'll let you lead. Okay. Alright. Look.\n\nPenis schminis. Okay? We're all people. Okay. Which one of us do you think is gonna be the 1st one to get married?\n\nMy mom, I was married. Yeah. Me too, technically. I had a wedding. Alright.\n\nJust trying to start an interesting discussion. I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? Isn't Ben in this? Oh, yeah.\n\nAbsolutely.", "paragraphs": [{"sentences": [{"text": "Got divorced.", "start": 0.08, "end": 0.48}, {"text": "They sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to
