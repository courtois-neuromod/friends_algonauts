Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening, and I guess I'll just see you kids around. Nighty night. You're not a dad.\n\nYou're not a dad. Dad. Can't believe you got us into trouble. So are you okay? Yeah.\n\nJust I feel like I'm about a100. I thought I was just one of the guys. Come here. I'll make you feel like 1 of the guys. You know, for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.\n\nWhat are you talking about? I was killing them. Yeah. Well, they suck too. Okay.\n\nAnd then you take the poopy diaper, and you put it in the poopy diaper pail. Hey, Ross. Just so you know, calling it a poopy diaper doesn't make this process any cuter. Hello. Hey, Come on up.\n\nI'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together. Okay. We can do this now, can't we, Ben? Yes. We can.\n\nYes. We can. There. I did it. I did it.\n\nLook at that.

Okay. This could go on for a while.\n\nYou're right. At, Wayne downstairs? Well, this was fun. We should really do it again sometime, ma'am. What do you say?\n\nOkay. Alright. So I've got him here.

Look at this nice deep hole I've been digging.\n\nHey, Bert. Isn't this nice nice hole here? Hey. Okay. Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him.\n\nNow I've looked ahead on the tape, And he does find him again. But okay. Before that happens, there's some pretty riff going for a while. But I think we can handle it. And there's just the alphabet, but we know that ends well.\n\nSo okay. Here we go. Bert. Bert. Bert.\n\nHey. What happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh, no.
