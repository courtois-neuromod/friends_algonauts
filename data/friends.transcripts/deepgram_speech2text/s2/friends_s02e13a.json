Now just how big of a star is by yourself? In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepherd. Woah. Really? So are you guys in the movie, or you're just really paranoid? Hey, Sal. Mhmm. Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway stop. Excuse me. Jerry is the director. Which one's he? 1 in the director's chair? Gotcha. Pheebs, walk with me. Okay. How come I'm walking with you? Well, we're we're just going over here so that we can get away from a horrible flesh eating virus. For the love of god, woman, listen to me. Is he looking? Is he looking? We've got a problem. Hi. Tell me. I can't do Koozie's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a mustache. Is it bad? It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Fabulous. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean Claude Van Damme is going to be making out with Kate Kaplan. I hate actors. Nice camouflage, man. For a minute there, I almost didn't see you. Is your name Chandler? Yes. Yes. It is. Chandler Ving. Do you know me, or are you just really good at this game? I'm Susie Moss. 4th grade, glasses. I used to carry around a box of animal crackers A purse. Susie Moss. Right. Yeah. Wow. You look great job growing up. It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it. Oh, right. Yeah. Well, I graduated 4th grade and realized I wasn't a pin. Remember the class play? You you pulled up my skirt, and the entire auditorium saw my underpants. Yes. Back then, I, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank god I don't do that anymore. So what have you been doing since childhood? Well, I got a new belt. I wondered. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. What? Jean Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie. He is so hot. You think? The muscles from Brussels, Wham bam van dam? Did you see time cop? No. Was he any good in it? Great till he, like, totally changed time. Wow. So why don't you go talk to him? Oh, yeah. What? So you go over there. You tell him you think what's the worst that could happen? He could hear me. Oh, okay. I'm doing it for you. Oh, wait. Don't don't don't you dare. Don't. Don't tell My cock. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. This is gonna sound kinda goofy, but, My friend over there who cooks, by the way, she thinks you're cute. You don't think I'm cute? I I don't know. Do you think you're cute? Okay. We're kinda getting off the track here. I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her? You can tell her I think her friend is cute. Steven Herz was the kid who would eat anything for money. David Thine was the guy who had no elbows. Okay. Well, then who was the kid that got caught masturbating? Okay. That's not what he was doing. Alright? He was looking for his bus money. Lighten up. Oh, that's when we gotta go. Oh, oh, okay. So listen. How many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date? Well, let's try one more. There you go. Saint Ernie's. 8 o'clock. I'll be there. And who knows if things go well, maybe this time, I'll get to see your underwear. No one was around to hear that. So what he say? What a jerk. I kept talking about you, and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, if I said no. Thanks anyway. He just kept asking, Asking. Asking. Asking. Asking. Asking. Rachel, if you if you wanna go out with them, you can. Sounds like a big jerk to me, but if that's what you wanna do. John Claude, she said yes. I'll see you tonight. Thank you. And then Jean Claude took me to that place, Crossroads, And that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore. Oh. Oh, man. She's so smoking. She's got the greatest set of No guys around. Does anybody need anything? Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh, actually, I'll get it. If I ask you too, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself. That is So unfair. I know. Like, you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme. Hey, Joey. I have to cancel racquetball for tonight. That was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours. You're blowing me off for a monkey? Hey. We can reschedule for Saturday. Yeah. Unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons. Hey. Stick a fork in me.

With mealworms. Candle. What do you think is gonna happen here tonight? Hello. Oh, hi. Are you on your way Oh, No. No. No. I I understand. I mean, a monkey's gotta work. No. It's it's no big deal. It's not like I, Had anything special planned. You know? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Bye. I'm sorry, man. Man? Feel that? What? That we'd pass the moment where we should've stopped holding hands? Oh, yeah. Okay. Rachel, why don't you start talking first? Alright. I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light. I did nothing Do you think I can't see you in the TV set? Alright. Monica, if there is something that you would like to share You know, you have no right to go out with him. That that is the most ridiculous me out. Does that Says you would.

Now just how big of a star is by yourself? In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepherd. Woah. Really?\n\nSo are you guys in the movie, or you're just really paranoid? Hey, Sal. Mhmm. Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway stop. Excuse me.\n\nJerry is the director. Which one's he? 1 in the director's chair? Gotcha. Pheebs, walk with me.\n\nOkay. How come I'm walking with you? Well, we're we're just going over here so that we can get away from a horrible flesh eating virus. For the love of god, woman, listen to me. Is he looking?\n\nIs he looking? We've got a problem. Hi. Tell me. I can't do Koozie's makeup.\n\nShe refuses to acknowledge that she has a mustache. Is it bad? It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Fabulous. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean Claude Van Damme is going to be making out with Kate Kaplan.\n\nI hate actors. Nice camouflage, man. For a minute there, I almost didn't see you. Is your name Chandler? Yes.\n\nYes. It is. Chandler Ving. Do you know me, or are you just really good at this game? I'm Susie Moss.\n\n4th grade, glasses. I used to carry around a box of animal crackers A purse. Susie Moss. Right. Yeah.\n\nWow. You look great job growing up. It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it. Oh, right. Yeah.\n\nWell, I graduated 4th grade and realized I wasn't a pin. Remember the class play? You you pulled up my skirt, and the entire auditorium saw my underpants. Yes. Back then, I, used humor as a defense mechanism.\n\nThank god I don't do that anymore. So what have you been doing since childhood? Well, I got a new belt. I wondered. Oh my god.\n\nOh my god. Oh my god. What? Jean Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie.\n\nHe is so hot. You think? The muscles from Brussels, Wham bam van dam? Did you see time cop? No.\n\nWas he any good in it? Great till he, like, totally changed time. Wow. So why don't you go talk to him? Oh, yeah.\n\nWhat? So you go over there. You tell him you think what's the worst that could happen? He could hear me. Oh, okay.\n\nI'm doing it for you. Oh, wait. Don't don't don't you dare. Don't. Don't tell My cock.\n\nExcuse me. Hi. Hi. This is gonna sound kinda goofy, but, My friend over there who cooks, by the way, she thinks you're cute. You don't think I'm cute?\n\nI I don't know. Do you think you're cute? Okay. We're kinda getting off the track here. I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute.\n\nSo what should I tell her? You can tell her I think her friend is cute. Steven Herz was the kid who would eat anything for money. David Thine was the guy who had no elbows. Okay.\n\nWell, then who was the kid that got caught masturbating? Okay. That's not what he was doing. Alright? He was looking for his bus money.\n\nLighten up. Oh, that's when we gotta go. Oh, oh, okay. So listen. How many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date?\n\nWell, let's try one more. There you go. Saint Ernie's. 8 o'clock. I'll be there.\n\nAnd who knows if things go well, maybe this time, I'll get to see your underwear. No one was around to hear that. So what he say? What a jerk. I kept talking about you, and he kept asking me out.\n\nI mean, naturally, you know, if I said no. Thanks anyway. He just kept asking, Asking. Asking. Asking.\n\nAsking. Asking. Rachel, if you if you wanna go out with them, you can. Sounds like a big jerk to me, but if that's what you wanna do. John Claude, she said yes.\n\nI'll see you tonight. Thank you. And then Jean Claude took me to that place, Crossroads, And that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore. Oh. Oh, man.\n\nShe's so smoking. She's got the greatest set of No guys around. Does anybody need anything? Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh, actually, I'll get it.\n\nIf I ask you too, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself. That is So unfair. I know. Like, you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme. Hey, Joey.\n\nI have to cancel racquetball for tonight. That was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours. You're blowing me off for a monkey? Hey.\n\nWe can reschedule for Saturday. Yeah. Unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons. Hey. Stick a fork in me.\n\nI am done. Stick a fork what? Like, when you're cooking a steak. Oh, okay. I don't eat meat.\n\nWell, then how do you know when vegetables are done? Well, you don't. You just you eat them, and you can tell. Okay. Then eat me.\n\nI'm done. I've met the perfect woman. What? Okay. We're sitting on her couch.\n\nWe're fooling around, and then suddenly, she turns to me and says, do you ever wanna do it in an elevator? God. What did you say? I believe my exact words were. I mean, I didn't know what to say.\n\nHow do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator? Oh, you just know. Oh, shoot. We gotta go. Got a reservation in 30 minutes.\n\nOh, no. No. No. No. No.\n\nNo. No. No. No. No.\n\nNo. You see, what I had planned shouldn't take more than 2, 3 minutes tops. Oh, my 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go. But, here's an idea.\n\nHave you ever worn women's underwear? Well, yes, actually. But, they were my aunt Edna's, and there were 3 of us in there. Well, I was thinking it would be, kinda sexy if you wore mine tonight at dinner. You you want me to wear your panties?\n\nCould you? Well, if I was wearing your underwear, then, what would you be wearing? You're swell. K. Got the music.\n\nGot the dinner. Oh, I'm checking out. I made Marcel's favorite dish, banana cake Oh. With mealworms. Candle.\n\nWhat do you think is gonna happen here tonight? Hello. Oh, hi. Are you on your way Oh, No. No.\n\nNo. I I understand. I mean, a monkey's gotta work. No. It's it's no big deal.\n\nIt's not like I, Had anything special planned. You know? Yeah. Okay. Okay.\n\nOkay. Bye. I'm sorry, man. Man? Feel that?\n\nWhat? That we'd pass the moment where we should've stopped holding hands? Oh, yeah. Okay. Rachel, why don't you start talking first?\n\nAlright. I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light. I did nothing Do you think I can't see you in the TV set? Alright.\n\nMonica, if there is something that you would like to share You know, you have no right to go out with him. That that is the most ridiculous me out. Does that Says you would. I absolutely wouldn't. Told me.\n\nDid you just Flick me? Okay. Well, you wouldn't let me finish, and I was just ow. That hurt. Quit looking.\n\nOw. You stop looking. You fricked me first. Ow. Get it.\n\nOw. Oh, what do you do you want me to stop seeing him? Is that what you want? Uh-huh. You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead?\n\nIs that what you want? Okay. Oh, that's what you want? Yes. Fine.\n\nFine. There we go. You know what? If we were in prison, you guys would feel like my bitches. Thanks for letting take a long time, you guys.\n\nForget about it. How you doing there, squirmy? I'm hanging in a little loud. So assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job.\n\nI mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibility. Nothing to do with casting. So what are you guys gonna eat?
