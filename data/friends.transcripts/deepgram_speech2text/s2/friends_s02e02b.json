Oh, so you just sort of happen to leave it in here? Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid? Okay, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Full? Okay. Okay. Okay. I just really, I just really need to not be with you right now. Hi. Who's this? Hi, high, Joanne? Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes. I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that. Okay? No. I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve. Hey. How did we do? Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out. I don't I did not freak out. Why'd you freak out? Because it's breast milk. It's gross. My breast milk is gross? This should be fun. No. No, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just I just don't think breast milk is for adults. Of course, the packaging does appeal to grown ups and kids. Ross, you are being silly. I've tried it. It's no big deal. Come on. Just taste it. That would be no. Why? I'm trying. Tantrum too. It doesn't taste bad. Yeah. It tastes kinda sweet. Sort of like, like what? Cantaloupe juice? Exactly. You've tasted it. You've you've you've tasted it? Uh-huh. Oh, you've tasted it. You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true. Get me the bottle. Get me the towel. Howdy. Give me a box of juice. Well, they switched me over to ombre. Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed. Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good. They wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler. He goes through, like, 2 bottles a day now. Well, you can. You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you. I don't know, but I was the best. You know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get out of the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese. Alright. Say you do that. You know, sooner or later, somebody's gonna come along that slices a battered cheddar. And then where are you gonna run? Yeah. I guess you're right. You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie. I'm gonna do it. Alright. Now go see miss Kitty, and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker. I don't know what else to say. Oh, well, that works out good because I'm not listening. I feel terrible. I really do. Oh, I'm sorry. Did my back hurt your knife? Say that I'm friends with her or we spend some time together. Is is that so terrible? Yes. It's that terrible? Yes, Monica. You don't get it. It's bad enough that she stole old guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with? But now she's actually but now she's actually stealing you. Mia, what are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my oh, weird. Oh, I love you. You guys, I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but, I love you guys too. Before? Yes. I really needed that. Look. I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she's just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Will you just give that a chance for me? I didn't do anything for you. New there? Wait. Wait. Wait. Morning. I said morning. I heard Yeah. Alright, everybody. I'm opening the doors. You boys ready? Ready. Yeah. I'm ready. You idiot. You stupid cowboy. You've blinded me. I'm sorry. Oh my god. So much. Todd, What the hell did you do? I'm sorry. I'm such a doofus. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. My god. What hasn't? These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all stop blasting. Listen. Let me say I buy you that cup of coffee now. Sure. So so I just thought the 2 of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that being one of the 2 of us. Alright? I know. I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you. Really? Me? Oh my god. Are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and I it's probably me just being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that Maybe you don't. Well, You're not totally paranoid. Oi. Okay. God. When you And, Ross, first started going out, it was really hard for me, for many reasons of which I'm not gonna bore you with now? But, I just I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together. And, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and, god, I hate it when she's right. True? A second. Thanks. Hey. Listen. Would you like to go to a movie sometime or something? Yeah. That'd be great. Yeah? I'd love it. I'd love it too. Okay. Can't you? Oh, shoot. I gotta go. Okay. So I'll talk to you later.

Oh, so you just sort of happen to leave it in here? Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid? Okay, Monica. I just have to know one thing.\n\nDid you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Full? Okay. Okay. Okay.\n\nI just really, I just really need to not be with you right now. Hi. Who's this? Hi, high, Joanne? Is Rachel working?\n\nIt's Monica. Yes. I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that. Okay?\n\nNo. I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve. Hey. How did we do?\n\nOh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out. I don't I did not freak out. Why'd you freak out? Because it's breast milk. It's gross.\n\nMy breast milk is gross? This should be fun. No. No, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it.\n\nI just I just don't think breast milk is for adults. Of course, the packaging does appeal to grown ups and kids. Ross, you are being silly. I've tried it. It's no big deal.\n\nCome on. Just taste it. That would be no. Why? I'm trying.\n\nTantrum too. It doesn't taste bad. Yeah. It tastes kinda sweet. Sort of like, like what?\n\nCantaloupe juice? Exactly. You've tasted it. You've you've you've tasted it? Uh-huh.\n\nOh, you've tasted it. You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true. Get me the bottle. Get me the towel. Howdy.\n\nGive me a box of juice. Well, they switched me over to ombre. Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed. Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good. They wanna put more people on it.\n\nYou should see this guy, Chandler. He goes through, like, 2 bottles a day now. Well, you can. You're an actor. This is your day job.\n\nThis isn't supposed to mean anything to you. I don't know, but I was the best. You know? I liked being the best. I don't know.\n\nMaybe I should just get out of the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese. Alright. Say you do that. You know, sooner or later, somebody's gonna come along that slices a battered cheddar.\n\nAnd then where are you gonna run? Yeah. I guess you're right. You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of.\n\nI say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie. I'm gonna do it. Alright. Now go see miss Kitty, and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.\n\nI don't know what else to say. Oh, well, that works out good because I'm not listening. I feel terrible. I really do. Oh, I'm sorry.\n\nDid my back hurt your knife? Say that I'm friends with her or we spend some time together. Is is that so terrible? Yes. It's that terrible?\n\nYes, Monica. You don't get it. It's bad enough that she stole old guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with? But now she's actually but now she's actually stealing you. Mia, what are you talking about?\n\nNobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my oh, weird. Oh, I love you. You guys, I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but, I love you guys too.\n\nBefore? Yes. I really needed that. Look. I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong.\n\nI mean, she's just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Will you just give that a chance for me? I didn't do anything for you. New there?\n\nWait. Wait. Wait. Morning. I said morning.\n\nI heard Yeah. Alright, everybody. I'm opening the doors. You boys ready? Ready.\n\nYeah. I'm ready. You idiot. You stupid cowboy. You've blinded me.\n\nI'm sorry. Oh my god. So much. Todd, What the hell did you do? I'm sorry.\n\nI'm such a doofus. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. My god. What hasn't?\n\nThese new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all stop blasting. Listen. Let me say I buy you that cup of coffee now. Sure.\n\nSo so I just thought the 2 of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that being one of the 2 of us. Alright? I know.\n\nI probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you. Really? Me? Oh my god. Are you kidding?\n\nRoss is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and I it's probably me just being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that Maybe you don't. Well, You're not totally paranoid. Oi. Okay. God.\n\nWhen you And, Ross, first started going out, it was really hard for me, for many reasons of which I'm not gonna bore you with now? But, I just I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together. And, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and, god, I hate it when she's right. True? A second.\n\nThanks. Hey. Listen. Would you like to go to a movie sometime or something? Yeah.\n\nThat'd be great. Yeah? I'd love it. I'd love it too. Okay.\n\nCan't you? Oh, shoot. I gotta go. Okay. So I'll talk to you later.\n\nOkay? Alright, Julie. Bye. Bye.
