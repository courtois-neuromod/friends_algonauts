Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast. Yes. They want me to do it, which is really cool since I've never catered before, and I really need the money. And this isn't a problem for you, is it? Would it matter? Oh, you were so great. Thank you. Are you really not going? I'm really not going. I mean, I don't get it. They already live together. Why do they need to get married?

No. No. I'm on right after this guy shoots himself. Woah. She's pretty. Yeah. Oh, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about, you know, how to work with the cameras and smell the fart acting. I'm sorry. What? What's going on? Smell the fart acting. It's like you got so many lines to learn so fast that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinking of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. Okay. Oh, here's my scene. Here's my scene. Missus Wallace? Yes. I'm doctor Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. Tell me. Is she going to be alright? I'm afraid the situation is much more dire than we'd expected.

So I'll have some breakfast, and I'll take a little walk, and and, you know, then I'll have my massage. Little did she know, god was Okay. But that's it. But the weirdest thing was okay. I was cleansing her aura when it happened. And when when her spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far. What do you mean? I I I think it went into me. God, this So hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck. Oh, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise, the movie would have been called Silence of the Ducks. Okay. Who ordered what? Oh, I believe I had the half drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim. Yes. And this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf? Oh god. I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom coming. I know, but it's just it's the 1st time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, my life is total crap. You know? Wanna talk about clap? Try listening to Stella Needman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the 100th time. I'm sorry. At least you guys don't have to hear the stuff she says in my head. Phoebes, how long do you think this lady will be with us? I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up. There she is. Hey. Mom, weebie. So this is where you work. Oh, it's Wonderful. Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? Well, I guess that's the fun. Yeah. Pretty much. Here, My friends, Monica, you look gorgeous. Oh my. The last time I saw you was eat or be eaten. This is Joey. Hi. This is Phoebe, and this is Chandler. And you remember Ross? Oh, hello, Ross. Hi, missus. So what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job? Oh, mom. Okay. If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink. Believe me. Sometimes that happens. This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you. Really? Yes. Oh. Oh, let's make a day of it. We'll have lunch. We'll Shop. We'll get our nails done. Whatever you want. Okay, mom. I I have to work. What? No one else can pour coffee? I know who it is you remind me of, Evelyn Dermer, because that's before she got the lousy facelift. Now she looks like Whoopi sales? Hey. Hey. Who's Evelyn Dermer? I don't know. Who's soupy sales? Oh my god. There's an unattractive nude man And playing the cello. Yeah. Well, just be glad it's not playing a smaller instrument. You have some life here, sweetie. I know. And, mom, I realize you and daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but, god, this is just so much better for me. You know? I do know. You didn't love Barry, honey, And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want. For me. Well, not just for you. What what do you mean? I'm, Considering leaving your father. Alright. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding chicken breasts. Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick. What? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them. Oh, honey. I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me. What what can I do? Do you want me to make those little marshmallow Treats she used to like. I can call up Carmela and find out how. Mom, I just don't understand. I thought you were happy. Yeah. Well, so did I. But but you know how sometimes you're driving on the highway, and you get home, And you can't actually remember having driven there. Uh-huh. Well, that's kind of what my life's been like. Well, Couldn't you listen to the radio more? Wish it were that easy. But then I see you here, and I keep Thinking, why can't I have this? I want adventures. I wanna hang out. I want a Chandler. Oh, no. Mom, Mom, believe me, Chandler is no reason to leave. Daddy, I mean, you think this looks like I'm having a lot of fun, but it's really hard. Really hard. I've got this lousy job. I barely know if I'm gonna make rent and forget about buying stuff. Oh, honey. You don't understand. I'd be doing what you're doing, but with money. It's very Friends. And you had no idea they weren't getting along? None. They didn't fight a lot? No. They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems? You know, in my day, divorce was not an option. Hey. Look who's up. I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. You know? I just figured as a grown up, I wouldn't have to worry about this. Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you. Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut? You know, it's funny. When my parents got divorced, they sent me this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves.

Okay.\n\nAlright. I've got some news. It's about us. Oh, you and me? No.\n\nSusan and me. The other Us. Okay. We're, we're getting married. As in I now pronounce you wife and wife, Mary.\n\nAnyway, we'd like you to come, but we Totally understand if you don't want to. Yeah. Well, why wouldn't I wanna come? I had fun at the 1st wedding. Look.\n\nI just thought that No. No. No. I mean, I hey. Why shouldn't I be happy for you?\n\nYou know? I mean, what would it say about me if I couldn't, revel in your joy. And I'm I'm reveling, baby. Believe me. Is your finger caught in that chair?\n\nMhmm. 1 has to go. Uh-huh. Bothered by something. Why don't you tell me what it is?\n\nThis is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television. I know. It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on days of our lives.\n\nAnd then I started thinking about all of us and how these are the days of our life. Yes. What? What? Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.\n\nYes. They want me to do it, which is really cool since I've never catered before, and I really need the money. And this isn't a problem for you, is it? Would it matter? Oh, you were so great.\n\nThank you. Are you really not going? I'm really not going. I mean, I don't get it. They already live together.\n\nWhy do they need to get married? Because they love each other and that they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them. If you wanna call that a reason. Who's the bitterest man in the living room? The bitterest man in the living room.\n\nHi, neighbor. Ross, I thought you were over this. But that has nothing to do with this. Okay. She's my ex wife.\n\nIf if if she were marrying a guy, none of you would expect me to be there. Hey. If she were marrying a guy, she'd be, like, the worst lesbian ever. Did I miss it? Did I miss it?\n\nNo. No. I'm on right after this guy shoots himself. Woah. She's pretty.\n\nYeah. Oh, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about, you know, how to work with the cameras and smell the fart acting. I'm sorry. What?\n\nWhat's going on? Smell the fart acting. It's like you got so many lines to learn so fast that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinking of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. Okay.\n\nOh, here's my scene. Here's my scene. Missus Wallace? Yes. I'm doctor Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.\n\nTell me. Is she going to be alright? I'm afraid the situation is much more dire than we'd expected. Your sister is suffering from a subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this further over coffee.\n\nNice. Actually. Hey. You know, for a minute there, I thought you were actually trying to smell something. That's good.\n\nDo it. You. You're so good. Do it again. That one where you have to go.\n\nDamn it, Braverman. It's right there on the chart. That's great. Alright. I gotta get to work.\n\nI got a big dinosaur bone to inspect. No. No. No. That's me.\n\nOh, right. Oh, hello. Oh, thanks. Couldn't, Is everything okay? No.\n\nOne of my clients died on the massage table today. Oh. Oh my god. That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get. Yeah.\n\nUh-huh. She was, you know, 82 years old, and, Her name was, missus Edelman. Aw. Honey? Yeah.\n\nIt's just so strange. I mean, you know, she probably woke up this morning and thought, alright. So I'll have some breakfast, and I'll take a little walk, and and, you know, then I'll have my massage. Little did she know, god was Okay. But that's it.\n\nBut the weirdest thing was okay. I was cleansing her aura when it happened. And when when her spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far. What do you mean? I I I think it went into me.\n\nGod, this So hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck. Oh, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise, the movie would have been called Silence of the Ducks. Okay.\n\nWho ordered what? Oh, I believe I had the half drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim. Yes. And this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf? Oh god.\n\nI can't believe you're so uptight about your mom coming. I know, but it's just it's the 1st time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, my life is total crap. You know? Wanna talk about clap? Try listening to Stella Needman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the 100th time.\n\nI'm sorry. At least you guys don't have to hear the stuff she says in my head. Phoebes, how long do you think this lady will be with us? I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business.\n\nSit up. There she is. Hey. Mom, weebie. So this is where you work.\n\nOh, it's Wonderful. Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? Well, I guess that's the fun.\n\nYeah. Pretty much. Here, My friends, Monica, you look gorgeous. Oh my. The last time I saw you was eat or be eaten.\n\nThis is Joey. Hi. This is Phoebe, and this is Chandler. And you remember Ross? Oh, hello, Ross.\n\nHi, missus. So what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job? Oh, mom. Okay. If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.\n\nBelieve me. Sometimes that happens. This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house.\n\nI am just so proud of you. Really? Yes. Oh. Oh, let's make a day of it.\n\nWe'll have lunch. We'll Shop. We'll get our nails done. Whatever you want. Okay, mom.\n\nI I have to work. What? No one else can pour coffee? I know who it is you remind me of, Evelyn Dermer, because that's before she got the lousy facelift. Now she looks like Whoopi sales?\n\nHey. Hey. Who's Evelyn Dermer? I don't know. Who's soupy sales?\n\nOh my god. There's an unattractive nude man And playing the cello. Yeah. Well, just be glad it's not playing a smaller instrument. You have some life here, sweetie.\n\nI know. And, mom, I realize you and daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but, god, this is just so much better for me. You know? I do know. You didn't love Barry, honey, And I've never seen you this happy.\n\nI look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want. For me. Well, not just for you. What what do you mean? I'm, Considering leaving your father.\n\nAlright. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding chicken breasts. Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.\n\nWhat? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them. Oh, honey. I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me.\n\nWhat what can I do? Do you want me to make those little marshmallow Treats she used to like. I can call up Carmela and find out how. Mom, I just don't understand. I thought you were happy.\n\nYeah. Well, so did I. But but you know how sometimes you're driving on the highway, and you get home, And you can't actually remember having driven there. Uh-huh. Well, that's kind of what my life's been like.\n\nWell, Couldn't you listen to the radio more? Wish it were that easy. But then I see you here, and I keep Thinking, why can't I have this? I want adventures. I wanna hang out.\n\nI want a Chandler. Oh, no. Mom, Mom, believe me, Chandler is no reason to leave. Daddy, I mean, you think this looks like I'm having a lot of fun, but it's really hard. Really hard.\n\nI've got this lousy job. I barely know if I'm gonna make rent and forget about buying stuff. Oh, honey. You don't understand. I'd be doing what you're doing, but with money.\n\nIt's very Friends. And you had no idea they weren't getting along? None. They didn't fight a lot? No.\n\nThey didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems? You know, in my day, divorce was not an option. Hey. Look who's up.\n\nI just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. You know? I just figured as a grown up, I wouldn't have to worry about this. Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering?\n\nI mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you. Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut? You know, it's funny. When my parents got divorced, they sent me this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves.
