Well, I I guess I just never think of money as an issue. That's because you have it. That's a good point. So, How come you guys haven't talked about this before?\n\nBecause it's always something. You know? Like, with Monica's new job or the whole Ross's Birthday hoopla. What? Woah.\n\nHey. I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative there's gonna be a hoopla. Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff factored the thing. If it's if it makes anybody feel better, then we could just forget the thing, and and we'll just do the gift. Can't get the the thing's not the gift.\n\nNo. The thing was we were gonna go see Hootie and the blowfish. Hootie and Omar I I I can catch them on the radio. No. Now I feel bad.\n\nYou wanna go to the concert? No. Look. Hey. It's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.\n\nAll of us. Together. Not at the concert. Okay. Yeah.\n\nThank you. Thanks. Yeah. So the Ebola virus, that's got a suck, Gee, Monica. What's in the bag?\n\nI don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look. It's like a skit. Why it's dinner for 6, 5 steaks, and an eggplant For Phoebe. Oh, yeah.\n\nWe switched meat suppliers at work, and the the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank you. But wait. There's more. Hey, Chandler. What sent that envelope.\n\nBy the way, this didn't seem so dorky out in the hall. Come on. Why? It's 6 tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish. The Blowfish.\n\nIt's on us. Right? So don't worry. This is our treat. So thank you.\n\nCould you be less enthused? Look. It's a nice gesture. It is. But it just feels like Like charity.\n\nCharity? We're just we're just trying to do a nice thing here. Yeah. But, Ross, you have to understand. Your nice thing makes us feel about this big.\n\nActually, it makes us feel that big. I don't understand. I mean, it's like we can't win with you guys. Yeah. I mean, if you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault.\n\nMaybe that's just How you feel? Oh, now you're telling us how we feel. God. See? Okay.\n\nWe never should have talked about this. Alright. I'm I'm gonna Pass on the concert because I'm just not in a very hooty place right now. Me neither. Me too.\n\nGuys, It's we bought the tickets. Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff. Why did you look at me when you said that? So I guess now we can't go. What?\n\nCome on. You do what you wanna do? What? We always had to do together? You know what?\n\nYou're right. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine.\n\nFine. Alright. We're gonna go. It's not for another 6 hours. We're gonna go then.\n\nTaylor? Yeah? Oh, jeez. Are you ready? Yes.\n\nYes. Let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today. Woah. Woah. Woah.\n\nWhat? You you had sex today? Wow. It sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome.\n\nOkay? She was biting her lip To stop from screaming. Wow. Now I know it's been a while, but I took that as a good sign. Still doing the screening thing?\n\nI had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again. Enough to me. You know what to do. Hey, Bob.\n\nIt's Jade, listen. I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day. And just so you know, I ended up a guy. Bob here. Oh, hi.\n\nSo, you met someone, Yes. Yes. I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago. So, How was it?\n\nOh, Bob. He was nothing compared to you. I divide my lip to keep from screaming your name. Well, that makes me feel so good. It's just so awkward and bumpy.\n\nWell, maybe he had some kind of, new, cool style that you're not familiar with it. And, maybe you have to get used to it. Well, there really wasn't much time to get used to it, if you know what I mean. You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.\n\nYeah. I know. It's my birthday. Think we all should be here. So let's go.\n\nAlright. Woo. Well, may you know, maybe we should thank for 1 song. Yeah. I mean, it'd be rude to them for us to leave now.\n\nYou know, the guys are probably having a great time.
