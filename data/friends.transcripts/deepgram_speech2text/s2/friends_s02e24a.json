How'd the audition go? Incredible. I met the director this time, and you will never believe who it was. Oh. Alright. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty. Wow. Yeah. There's just 1 thing that might be kind of a problem. See, I, I had to kiss this guy because he was just so darn cute. No. As part of the audition. See, I'm up for the part of this guy who the main guy kisses. Well, hey. You're an actor. I see, you just suck it up and you do it, or you just do it. I did do it. I'm a professional. Besides, my first girlfriend was Lisa De Bautista, so I'm no stranger to the mustache. So what's the problem? See, after the scene, mister Beatty comes up to me and he says, good actor, bad kisser. Can you believe that? Me, not a good kisser. That's like like mother Teresa, not a good mother. Come on. Who cares what that guy thinks? You know, what does Warren Beatty know about kissing? Hey. What'd you Great. Yep. This kiss thing is definitely a problem. Mister Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay. One of you girls come over here and kiss me. You got it. Right. Hey. Come on. I need your help here. Alright. I'll do it. I've kissed him before. I can do it again. See this? This is a friend. Uh-huh. Let's go. Wait. I've gone. Oh. Okay. Good. Very good. Firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend. Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem? Joy, you know, maybe you're just not used to kissing men. You know? Maybe you just tensed up a little bit. Maybe that's what you need to work on. Yeah. That makes sense. Over my dead body. And I'll be using his dead body as a shield. Come on out, honey. I'm telling you. You look good. Tell her she looks good. Tell her she looks good. Oh my god. You look so good. I Cannot believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when you're nauseous. So don't. I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway. It's your your ex fiancee's wedding. Because I promised Mindy I would. Yeah. Well, you Promise Barry you'd marry him. Look. You guys, I have to go. I'm the maid of honor. And besides, you know what? I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself. Boo, someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Did someone get a little action? I may have. Woo hoo. It's dead. What'd you look like? Well, we haven't actually met. We just, stayed up all night talking on the Internet. Woo hoo. Geek. I like this girl. Okay? I seriously like this girl. You You know how sometimes I tend to get a little defended and quippy? Get out of me. Uh-huh. Well, she totally called me on it. Okay? She said cut it out, Get real, and I did. Wow. What's that like? It's like this. Me. No jokes. Alright. Stop it. You're freaking me out. Oh, yeah. I don't like you this way. Alright. I'll see you guys later. Okay. Bye, Richard. Bye bye. Bye, sweetie. I love you. I love you too. I think my boyfriend's ever so dreamy. Wonder what our wedding's gonna be like. What are you talking about? What wedding? Come on. Like, you never talk about that? No. Never. I mean, we're we're just living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once not to get all hung up on where is this going. Afraid to ask him? Could not be more terrified. Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing. Give Rachel another chance. Dress up like princess Bubbly Young. I was laughing at this Quip, Leno made last night. I wasn't laughing at your dress. I love you. Where's Billy? There he is. Where's Billy? There he is. Aw. You know, that's probably why babies learn to talk so they can tell grown ups to cut it out. Hey. You know, I got a question for you. Just a little thing. No pressure. Okay. Do you ever, like, think about the future? Sure. I do. Yeah? Am I in it? Honey, you are it. Oh god. You're about to get so lucky. Yeah. Keep talking. Well, Sometimes I think about selling my practice. We could move to France, Make French toast. Okay. So, we're in France, and, We're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner? Like a hound? Not a basset. A bassinet. You really need the bassinet. Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. You, do you do not see kids in our future? Oh, hey. I love children. I have children, I just don't wanna be 70 when our kids go off to college and our life can finally start. Look. I want you now. Well, that's great.

I want this part So much. Just 1 kiss. I won't tell him. Joey, no means no. Hey. I'm sorry. We don't have your sheep. Oh, Rich, I think you look cute. And you, You. You, I could eat with a spoon. Get away from me. I said no. Hey, bud. Richard Buzz. He's waiting downstairs. Oh, Richard's here? I should run down and say goodbye to him. Bye. Hi. Good luck. So how's your date with your cyber chick going? Oh, hey. When is all that? Oh, it's a website. It's the, Guggenheim Museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words. What does she mean by h h? It means we're holding hands. Are you the cutest? I'm afraid I might just be. You know what I think is so great that you are totally into this person, yet for all you know, she could be, like, 90 years old or have 2 heads or it could be a guy. K. It's not a guy. Alright? I know her. It could be like a big giant guy. Man, I got this close to him, and Monica need me in the back. What's going on? We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend's a girl. No. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men. How do you not fall down more? Okay. Ask her what is Current method of birth control. Alright. My husband is sleeping with his secretary. She's married? Well, at least we know she's a woman. I can't believe she's married. Oh, man. I'm sorry. This must be really tough for you. So I read this article the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings because When pigeons eat rice, it kills them. Oh, so that's why you never see pigeons in sushi bars. See, we're having Oh, absolutely. Yeah. You know, I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not gonna be thinking about. Neither am I. Yeah. Hey there. Hi. Are you alright? Yeah. When I was in the bathroom, I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and, God. I just started thinking I shouldn't be here. You know? I shouldn't. People are gonna be looking at me and judging me and and thinking about the last Sweetie, it's gonna be okay. Alright? It's a wedding. Generally, people focus on the bride. Oh, god. I know you're right. Alrighty. Everybody look at me. Good. Alright. It's time, bridesmaids and ushers. Let's say 2 lines. Thank you. Okay. Okay. I'll see you after the. Thank you. Good luck.

Joey. How'd the audition go? Incredible. I met the director this time, and you will never believe who it was. Oh.\n\nAlright. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty. Wow. Yeah.\n\nThere's just 1 thing that might be kind of a problem. See, I, I had to kiss this guy because he was just so darn cute. No. As part of the audition. See, I'm up for the part of this guy who the main guy kisses.\n\nWell, hey. You're an actor. I see, you just suck it up and you do it, or you just do it. I did do it. I'm a professional.\n\nBesides, my first girlfriend was Lisa De Bautista, so I'm no stranger to the mustache. So what's the problem? See, after the scene, mister Beatty comes up to me and he says, good actor, bad kisser. Can you believe that? Me, not a good kisser.\n\nThat's like like mother Teresa, not a good mother. Come on. Who cares what that guy thinks? You know, what does Warren Beatty know about kissing? Hey.\n\nWhat'd you Great. Yep. This kiss thing is definitely a problem. Mister Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong.\n\nOh, okay. One of you girls come over here and kiss me. You got it. Right. Hey.\n\nCome on. I need your help here. Alright. I'll do it. I've kissed him before.\n\nI can do it again. See this? This is a friend. Uh-huh. Let's go.\n\nWait. I've gone. Oh. Okay. Good.\n\nVery good. Firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend. Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?\n\nJoy, you know, maybe you're just not used to kissing men. You know? Maybe you just tensed up a little bit. Maybe that's what you need to work on. Yeah.\n\nThat makes sense. Over my dead body. And I'll be using his dead body as a shield. Come on out, honey. I'm telling you.\n\nYou look good. Tell her she looks good. Tell her she looks good. Oh my god. You look so good.\n\nI Cannot believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when you're nauseous. So don't. I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway. It's your your ex fiancee's wedding. Because I promised Mindy I would.\n\nYeah. Well, you Promise Barry you'd marry him. Look. You guys, I have to go. I'm the maid of honor.\n\nAnd besides, you know what? I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself. Boo, someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Did someone get a little action? I may have.\n\nWoo hoo. It's dead. What'd you look like? Well, we haven't actually met. We just, stayed up all night talking on the Internet.\n\nWoo hoo. Geek. I like this girl. Okay? I seriously like this girl.\n\nYou You know how sometimes I tend to get a little defended and quippy? Get out of me. Uh-huh. Well, she totally called me on it. Okay?\n\nShe said cut it out, Get real, and I did. Wow. What's that like? It's like this. Me.\n\nNo jokes. Alright. Stop it. You're freaking me out. Oh, yeah.\n\nI don't like you this way. Alright. I'll see you guys later. Okay. Bye, Richard.\n\nBye bye. Bye, sweetie. I love you. I love you too. I think my boyfriend's ever so dreamy.\n\nWonder what our wedding's gonna be like. What are you talking about? What wedding? Come on. Like, you never talk about that?\n\nNo. Never. I mean, we're we're just living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once not to get all hung up on where is this going. Afraid to ask him?\n\nCould not be more terrified. Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing. Give Rachel another chance. Dress up like princess Bubbly Young. I was laughing at this Quip, Leno made last night.\n\nI wasn't laughing at your dress. I love you. Where's Billy? There he is. Where's Billy?\n\nThere he is. Aw. You know, that's probably why babies learn to talk so they can tell grown ups to cut it out. Hey. You know, I got a question for you.\n\nJust a little thing. No pressure. Okay. Do you ever, like, think about the future? Sure.\n\nI do. Yeah? Am I in it? Honey, you are it. Oh god.\n\nYou're about to get so lucky. Yeah. Keep talking. Well, Sometimes I think about selling my practice. We could move to France, Make French toast.\n\nOkay. So, we're in France, and, We're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner? Like a hound? Not a basset.\n\nA bassinet. You really need the bassinet. Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. You, do you do not see kids in our future? Oh, hey.\n\nI love children. I have children, I just don't wanna be 70 when our kids go off to college and our life can finally start. Look. I want you now. Well, that's great.\n\nYou know, we don't need to talk about this now, really. I mean, this is so, like, way, way, way in the future. I'm talking hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet. Come on, Chandler. I want this part So much.\n\nJust 1 kiss. I won't tell him. Joey, no means no. Hey. I'm sorry.\n\nWe don't have your sheep. Oh, Rich, I think you look cute. And you, You. You, I could eat with a spoon. Get away from me.\n\nI said no. Hey, bud. Richard Buzz. He's waiting downstairs. Oh, Richard's here?\n\nI should run down and say goodbye to him. Bye. Hi. Good luck. So how's your date with your cyber chick going?\n\nOh, hey. When is all that? Oh, it's a website. It's the, Guggenheim Museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.\n\nWhat does she mean by h h? It means we're holding hands. Are you the cutest? I'm afraid I might just be. You know what I think is so great that you are totally into this person, yet for all you know, she could be, like, 90 years old or have 2 heads or it could be a guy.\n\nK. It's not a guy. Alright? I know her. It could be like a big giant guy.\n\nMan, I got this close to him, and Monica need me in the back. What's going on? We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend's a girl. No. Just ask her how long she's gonna live.\n\nWomen live longer than men. How do you not fall down more? Okay. Ask her what is Current method of birth control. Alright.\n\nMy husband is sleeping with his secretary. She's married? Well, at least we know she's a woman. I can't believe she's married. Oh, man.\n\nI'm sorry. This must be really tough for you. So I read this article the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings because When pigeons eat rice, it kills them. Oh, so that's why you never see pigeons in sushi bars. See, we're having Oh, absolutely.\n\nYeah. You know, I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not gonna be thinking about. Neither am I. Yeah. Hey there.\n\nHi. Are you alright? Yeah. When I was in the bathroom, I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and, God. I just started thinking I shouldn't be here.\n\nYou know? I shouldn't. People are gonna be looking at me and judging me and and thinking about the last Sweetie, it's gonna be okay. Alright? It's a wedding.\n\nGenerally, people focus on the bride. Oh, god. I know you're right. Alrighty. Everybody look at me.\n\nGood. Alright. It's time, bridesmaids and ushers. Let's say 2 lines. Thank you.\n\nOkay. Okay. I'll see you after the. Thank you. Good luck.\n\nThank you. Mwah. Okay. Okay. Okay.\n\nGod. Why the hell did you tell me? Sorry. What was I supposed to do? Stand up and shout, hey, Rachel.\n\nYour butt is showing. Yeah. Better you than Barry's uncle. Oh my god. This is so humiliating.\n\nI think the only thing that tops that one was was was when I was in 8th grade, and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire School.
