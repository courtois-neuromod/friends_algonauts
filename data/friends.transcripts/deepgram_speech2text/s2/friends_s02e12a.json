Then put it in your mouth with monkey Deer. That commercial always makes me so sad. Yeah. But then the guy opens his beer, and those girls run at him. So everything seems to work out okay. I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel. Cell. I can see that because they both have those big brown eyes and, you know, the little pouty chin and the fact that they're both monkeys. Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, you know, giving him away. Well, Ross, you had to. I mean, it was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbie who will no longer be wearing white to her wedding. Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and when you got it back, there'd be little monkey raisins in it? He loved that joke. Yeah. Well, sure. When he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat, all of a sudden, I had this big attitude Hey. Hey. Figured out. Kiss and I got rhythm? No. My 1st fan mail tonight, please. Dear doctor Ramore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you. Gosh. Your not so secret admirer, Erica Ford. Oh, wait. PS, enclosed, please find Fourteen of my eyelashes. You know, in crazy world, that means you're married. This wasn't addressed to days of our lives. This is this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it. This woman was in our building. Oh my god. I got my very old stalker. Hey. You know, you are so lucky. I have to share mine with a bunch of guys down at work. Okay, Joey. Remember when we talked about good thing, bad thing? This is a bad thing. Hey, guys. Hey. Hey. Hey. Where are you off to, Traven, Jake? Well, there's this, paleontology conference in LA, so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel. Know, I think he will be surprised till he realizes he's a monkey and, you know, isn't capable of that emotion. Oh, Phoebe. That really cute guy is here again. Oh. Oh, okay. So everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story. Okay? And and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh now. I know. I know. Hello. Hi. I'm Rob Donan. Hi, Rob Donan. I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great. Oh, Wow. Anyway, I schedule performers for the children's libraries around the city, and I was just thinking, have you ever thought About playing your songs for kids. Oh, I would love to have kids. Hear You're the you're me play the songs that I will write for them. Hey. What are you gonna do for dinner? Well, we could just stay in and cook for ourselves. Hello. It's Erica. The stalker. Never mind. It's open. Yes. Getting her with a frying pan is a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she is in a car too. Right? Let's get out of here. The one time they're not home. Okay. Okay. Well, just leave. And when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me because we never met. That's how radio stars escape stalkers. She's coming. It's me. This is it. This is how we're gonna die. Ready? Wait. Wait. Wait. There we go. Mister Geller? Yes. Hi. Hi. Dean Liftson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question. Well, I, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchin. Answers to the name, Marcel? I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on. Oh my god. What happened? Well, he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better, But then he died. I can't believe this. I'm sorry, mister Geller. But, you know, There's an old saying, sometimes monkeys die. It's not a great saying, but It certainly is fitting today. Well, you know, someone shoulda called me. I'm sorry. Look. I know this can't bring him back, but here, it's Just a gesture. Zoo dollars? Yes. And come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well, it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died. I know. I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What what is she like? Well, you remember Kathy Bates in misery? Yeah. Well, she looks the exact opposite of that. And she's not crazy? Oh, no. No. No. She's a total whack job. Yeah. She thinks that Joey is actually doctor Drake Ramore. Oh my god. I mean, it is going out with her. He cannot pursue this. Hey. Just because this woman thinks can actually see Joey through the magical box in our living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness? Does she not deserve love? What are you looking at me for? He's the one who wants to buff the maniac. Are you okay? No. Uh-uh. I'm just I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just if I picture them all in their underwear That's not a good idea. That's kind of the reason Alaska got fired. Yeah. I'm just I'm I'm I'm used to playing for grown ups. You know? And they just grown ups drink their coffee and do their grown up thing. You know? And kids, Listen. That's it's just a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me? Was thinking about it. Okay. Okay. Alrighty. Let's play some tunes. Okay. Let's go find our seats.

Oh, these hands, these beautiful hands. Oh, I could just eat them, but I won't. Otherwise, my watch would fall off. No. Seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life giving hands.

Then put it in your mouth with monkey Deer. That commercial always makes me so sad. Yeah. But then the guy opens his beer, and those girls run at him.\n\nSo everything seems to work out okay. I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel. Cell. I can see that because they both have those big brown eyes and, you know, the little pouty chin and the fact that they're both monkeys. Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, you know, giving him away.\n\nWell, Ross, you had to. I mean, it was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbie who will no longer be wearing white to her wedding. Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and when you got it back, there'd be little monkey raisins in it? He loved that joke.\n\nYeah. Well, sure. When he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat, all of a sudden, I had this big attitude Hey. Hey.\n\nFigured out. Kiss and I got rhythm? No. My 1st fan mail tonight, please. Dear doctor Ramore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.\n\nGosh. Your not so secret admirer, Erica Ford. Oh, wait. PS, enclosed, please find Fourteen of my eyelashes. You know, in crazy world, that means you're married.\n\nThis wasn't addressed to days of our lives. This is this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it. This woman was in our building. Oh my god.\n\nI got my very old stalker. Hey. You know, you are so lucky. I have to share mine with a bunch of guys down at work. Okay, Joey.\n\nRemember when we talked about good thing, bad thing? This is a bad thing. Hey, guys. Hey. Hey.\n\nHey. Where are you off to, Traven, Jake? Well, there's this, paleontology conference in LA, so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel. Know, I think he will be surprised till he realizes he's a monkey and, you know, isn't capable of that emotion. Oh, Phoebe.\n\nThat really cute guy is here again. Oh. Oh, okay. So everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story. Okay?\n\nAnd and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh now. I know. I know. Hello.\n\nHi. I'm Rob Donan. Hi, Rob Donan. I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great. Oh, Wow.\n\nAnyway, I schedule performers for the children's libraries around the city, and I was just thinking, have you ever thought About playing your songs for kids. Oh, I would love to have kids. Hear You're the you're me play the songs that I will write for them. Hey. What are you gonna do for dinner?\n\nWell, we could just stay in and cook for ourselves. Hello. It's Erica. The stalker. Never mind.\n\nIt's open. Yes. Getting her with a frying pan is a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she is in a car too. Right?\n\nLet's get out of here. The one time they're not home. Okay. Okay. Well, just leave.\n\nAnd when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me because we never met. That's how radio stars escape stalkers. She's coming. It's me. This is it.\n\nThis is how we're gonna die. Ready? Wait. Wait. Wait.\n\nThere we go. Mister Geller? Yes. Hi. Hi.\n\nDean Liftson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question. Well, I, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchin. Answers to the name, Marcel?\n\nI'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on. Oh my god. What happened? Well, he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better, But then he died.\n\nI can't believe this. I'm sorry, mister Geller. But, you know, There's an old saying, sometimes monkeys die. It's not a great saying, but It certainly is fitting today. Well, you know, someone shoulda called me.\n\nI'm sorry. Look. I know this can't bring him back, but here, it's Just a gesture. Zoo dollars? Yes.\n\nAnd come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well, it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died. I know. I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker.\n\nWhat what is she like? Well, you remember Kathy Bates in misery? Yeah. Well, she looks the exact opposite of that. And she's not crazy?\n\nOh, no. No. No. She's a total whack job. Yeah.\n\nShe thinks that Joey is actually doctor Drake Ramore. Oh my god. I mean, it is going out with her. He cannot pursue this. Hey.\n\nJust because this woman thinks can actually see Joey through the magical box in our living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness? Does she not deserve love? What are you looking at me for? He's the one who wants to buff the maniac.\n\nAre you okay? No. Uh-uh. I'm just I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just if I picture them all in their underwear That's not a good idea.\n\nThat's kind of the reason Alaska got fired. Yeah. I'm just I'm I'm I'm used to playing for grown ups. You know? And they just grown ups drink their coffee and do their grown up thing.\n\nYou know? And kids, Listen. That's it's just a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?\n\nWas thinking about it. Okay. Okay. Alrighty. Let's play some tunes.\n\nOkay. Let's go find our seats. Chandler, we're gonna find our seats. Hold on a second. He thinks he can.\n\nHe thinks he can. What the hell? He can. Hi, everybody. I'm Phoebe.\n\nHi, Phoebe. Okay. I'm gonna play, some songs about grandparents. Okay? Now grandma's a A person who everyone likes.\n\nShe brought you a train and a bright shiny bike, but lately she hasn't been Coming to dinner, and last time you saw her, she looked so much thinner. Now your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the I'll have the, grilled salmon, and the doctor We'll have the risotto. Thank you. Oh, Drake. Isn't it amazing?\n\nYeah. It is. What? I mean, here we sit. Devil may care.\n\nAnd just a little while ago, you were reattaching Simone's spinal cord. Yeah. That was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes, like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minutes. Who's they?\n\nNo one. Drake, you are so talented. Let me see those hands. Oh, these hands, these beautiful hands. Oh, I could just eat them, but I won't.\n\nOtherwise, my watch would fall off. No. Seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life giving hands.\n\nJust to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick 1. Alright. Just 1. Wow. You're good at that?\n\nOh my god. Someone. He's choking. Is anyone here a doctor? Oh, yes.\n\nYes. The the best doctor in all of Salem, doctor Drake Ramore. Meet me in the Nocturnal House in 15 minutes. Hey. Look.\n\nI don't really enjoy being with other men that way, but, zoo dollars? It's about your monkey. It's alive. I don't understand. Why didn't you help that man?\n\nBecause, I'm a neurosurgeon, and that was clearly a case of, foodle chokeage. Alright. Look. I gotta tell you something. No.\n\nNo. No. No. No. You don't have to tell me anything.\n\nYou don't have to explain yourself to me. Oh, Who am I to question the great doctor Drake Ramoray?
