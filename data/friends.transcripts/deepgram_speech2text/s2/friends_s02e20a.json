You're trying to be more like Richard. Not like him per se. Just not Unlike them. Look. It's the artist formerly known as Chandler. Yes. We're just trying something here. You know? Yeah.

I mean, actually, I kinda think that we'll have we'll have 2 babies. 2 2 babies? Yeah. You know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully, the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive. Then what's gonna happen? Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city, so we'll probably move to, Scarsdale. Uh-huh. Yeah. That way, I figured, you know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time, but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And, yes, I know the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau County, but the school system's supposedly great. Wow. Wow. That's great. Great. Okay. Wow. You know what? I'm off my break now.

How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me? Well, for starters, you may wanna light it and lose the spatula. You know what? I think it's cute.\n\nYou're trying to be more like Richard. Not like him per se. Just not Unlike them. Look. It's the artist formerly known as Chandler.\n\nYes. We're just trying something here. You know? Yeah. So, Joey, why didn't you grow a mustache?\n\nOh, we flipped for it. I got the cigar. He got the mustache. Well, figured if we both moved, we'd look like dork. Yeah.\n\nYou really sidestepped that land, my. Hey. Listen. We gotta go. I promised Richard we made it downstairs.\n\nOh. You're meeting Richard? Yeah. We're going to a Ranger game. Yeah.\n\nDidn't he tell you? Oh, he told me he was going out with the guys. I just didn't know that you were the guys. You hear that? We're the guys.\n\nWe're the guys. That mustache, doesn't Chandler remind you of aunt Sylvia? Thank you. Hi. We're visiting.\n\nYay. It's Ben and his dada. Dada. Can you say dada? Oh.\n\nLook. I'm gonna tell you mommy's. You said it anyway, so you might as well try. Hell, I can't. No.\n\nNo. A while ago, I got a out of him, Which I thought, you know, might turn into sec and their caregiver. But Hey. Would you, would you hold him for a sec? Because I I gotta take this off.\n\nOh, yeah. There you go. Sure. Okay. What are you doing?\n\nI'm holding them. Yeah. Well, he's a baby, not a bomb. Okay. Well, just hold it like you'd hold a football.\n\nThis is how I would hold a football. Okay. Here. Here. There we go.\n\nOkay. I'm sorry. I'm just not very good with babies. I mean, I haven't been around them. I mean, you know, since I was 1.\n\nIt's alright. It's no big deal. Really? Yeah. Definitely.\n\nI'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's on, baby. What? What? You think about stuff like that? Yeah.\n\nI mean, actually, I kinda think that we'll have we'll have 2 babies. 2 2 babies? Yeah. You know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully, the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.\n\nThen what's gonna happen? Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city, so we'll probably move to, Scarsdale. Uh-huh. Yeah. That way, I figured, you know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time, but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want.\n\nAnd, yes, I know the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau County, but the school system's supposedly great. Wow. Wow. That's great. Great.\n\nOkay. Wow. You know what? I'm off my break now. So, here.\n\nYou take this, and, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee.
