It was so good. I think you killed us. Couldn't possibly eat another bite. I need something sweet. Does anyone wanna watch TV. Yeah. You do. Monica, your remote doesn't work. TV, you have to lift it And point. Oh. Oh, forget it. Hey. You know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for. Oh, I I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having. Oh, very sweet. You. Yeah. The other day, I was at the bus stop, and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs. I mean, it's not so much an underpants as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material, And the way they play with your mind, I mean, is it there? Is it not there? Are you aware that you're still talking? Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong? I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Wow. Wow. See? And I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything. I'm sorry. It's just this is the worst Thanksgiving ever. No. No. No. No. I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. Can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me. No. You're not gonna tell whole story about how your parents got divorced again, are you? Oh, god. Oh, really? No. No. Come on. I wanna hear it. It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out. See, it's a tradition like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family. Now, Chandler, dear, Just because your father and I are getting a divorce doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house Boy than with me. More turkey, mister Chandler. Every time you tell that story, that guy's accent gets thicker and thicker. So are he and your dad still together? No. No. No. After they got their own place, the houseboy got his own houseboy. You should have heard his accent. Alright. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings. I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse. Really? Worse than more turkey mister chile. Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem With the butler? Yes. Mine's worse. Pull Oh, no. In this life, Phoebe. Oh, this life. Oh, okay. No. Chandler's is worse. Man, it must be so cool remember and stuff like that. I don't have any past life memories. Of course, you don't, sweetie. You're brand new. I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving. Oh, let's not tell the story. Oh, come on. Come on. Oh, no. I know. I know. It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head. What? What? Joey got a turkey stuck on His head? Hey. It's not like it sounds. It's exactly like it sounds. Hello? Hello? Phoebe? Joey? What's going on? What? Oh my god. I know. It's stuck. Is Deb, how did this get on? I put it on to scare Chandler. Oh my god. Monica's gonna totally freak out. Well, then help me get it off. Plus, it smells really bad in here. Of course, it smells bad. You have your head up a dead Animal's ass. Monica. Hey. Hey. Hey. Did you get the turkey bit? Oh my god. Oh my god. Who is it? It's Joey. What what are you doing? And is this supposed to be funny? No. It's not supposed to be funny. It's supposed to be scary. Get that off now. I can't. It's stuck. Well, I don't care that that turkey has to feed people at my parents' house, and they're not gonna eat it off your head. Hold on. Okay? Let's just I'll think. Okay. I got it. Stevie? Mhmm. Alright. You pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Yeah. Now is not the time. Sorry, guys. Sorry. Okay. Count to 3. 123. What? I scared you. I know it. I'm over here, big guy. Yeah. You are. I scared you. You you did look like an idiot. I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. Alright? Remember when Ross tried to say butternut squash, and it came out squatter nut bosh? Yeah. That's the same. That's it. That's my worst Thanksgiving. Oh, wait. That can't be the one that Rachel was talking about because she didn't even know that that happened. Alright. What was it? I know which one. I I really don't Wanna tell the story. Oh, come on, Monica. Reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving's all about. You know, for me anyway, and, of course, the Indians. Look. Of all people, you do not want me to tell this story. What is that supposed to mean? Monica, I think Rachel's here. Okay. Happy Thanksgiving. Not for me. Chip and I broke up. Oh, why Why? What happened? Well, you know how my parents are out of town, and Chip was gonna come over. Yeah. Yeah. And you were gonna give her, you know, your flower. Monica, can you just call it sex? It really creeps me out when you call it that. Okay. And by the way, while we're at it, A guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me. Everyone, this is Chandler, my roommate and lead singer of our band. Ken. Ross. Oh, this is Monica. Hi. I'm Ross's little sister. Okay. I'm so glad you could come, Chandler. We got plenty of food, so I hope You're hungry? Oh, mom. No. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food. Oh. Oh, I'm so glad you brought him here then. Chandler, if you want, I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner. Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, then I'm in. Damn it. So, Rach, does it Does it feel weird around here now, you know, since I've been away at college? Oh, no. Not really. Well, that's cool. So So So that's Rachel, the girl you've been writing all those songs about? Yeah. Might wanna rethink the lyrics to she feels weird since I've been gone. I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut, Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. You know? I don't care how much he begs. I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson. You know what? I've just had it with high school boys. They are just silly. They're just Silly, stupid boys. I'm a start dating men. I'm sorry, Judy. I Couldn't find that bowl you and Jack were looking for. Call them mom and dad, you loser. What a cook.

It was so good. I think you killed us. Couldn't possibly eat another bite. I need something sweet.\n\nDoes anyone wanna watch TV. Yeah. You do. Monica, your remote doesn't work. TV, you have to lift it And point.\n\nOh. Oh, forget it. Hey. You know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.\n\nOh, I I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having. Oh, very sweet. You. Yeah. The other day, I was at the bus stop, and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up.\n\nWhich reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs. I mean, it's not so much an underpants as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material, And the way they play with your mind, I mean, is it there? Is it not there? Are you aware that you're still talking?\n\nIs anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong? I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Wow. Wow.\n\nSee? And I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything. I'm sorry. It's just this is the worst Thanksgiving ever. No.\n\nNo. No. No. I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. Can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.\n\nNo. You're not gonna tell whole story about how your parents got divorced again, are you? Oh, god. Oh, really? No.\n\nNo. Come on. I wanna hear it. It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out. See, it's a tradition like the parade.\n\nIf the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family. Now, Chandler, dear, Just because your father and I are getting a divorce doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house Boy than with me. More turkey, mister Chandler. Every time you tell that story, that guy's accent gets thicker and thicker.\n\nSo are he and your dad still together? No. No. No. After they got their own place, the houseboy got his own houseboy.\n\nYou should have heard his accent. Alright. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings. I don't know about that.\n\nI've got one that's worse. Really? Worse than more turkey mister chile. Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem With the butler? Yes.\n\nMine's worse. Pull Oh, no. In this life, Phoebe. Oh, this life. Oh, okay.\n\nNo. Chandler's is worse. Man, it must be so cool remember and stuff like that. I don't have any past life memories. Of course, you don't, sweetie.\n\nYou're brand new. I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving. Oh, let's not tell the story. Oh, come on. Come on.\n\nOh, no. I know. I know. It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head. What?\n\nWhat? Joey got a turkey stuck on His head? Hey. It's not like it sounds. It's exactly like it sounds.\n\nHello? Hello? Phoebe? Joey? What's going on?\n\nWhat? Oh my god. I know. It's stuck. Is Deb, how did this get on?\n\nI put it on to scare Chandler. Oh my god. Monica's gonna totally freak out. Well, then help me get it off. Plus, it smells really bad in here.\n\nOf course, it smells bad. You have your head up a dead Animal's ass. Monica. Hey. Hey.\n\nHey. Did you get the turkey bit? Oh my god. Oh my god. Who is it?\n\nIt's Joey. What what are you doing? And is this supposed to be funny? No. It's not supposed to be funny.\n\nIt's supposed to be scary. Get that off now. I can't. It's stuck. Well, I don't care that that turkey has to feed people at my parents' house, and they're not gonna eat it off your head.\n\nHold on. Okay? Let's just I'll think. Okay. I got it.\n\nStevie? Mhmm. Alright. You pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can.\n\nJoey? Yeah. Now is not the time. Sorry, guys. Sorry.\n\nOkay. Count to 3. 123. What? I scared you.\n\nI know it. I'm over here, big guy. Yeah. You are. I scared you.\n\nYou you did look like an idiot. I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. Alright? Remember when Ross tried to say butternut squash, and it came out squatter nut bosh? Yeah.\n\nThat's the same. That's it. That's my worst Thanksgiving. Oh, wait. That can't be the one that Rachel was talking about because she didn't even know that that happened.\n\nAlright. What was it? I know which one. I I really don't Wanna tell the story. Oh, come on, Monica.\n\nReliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving's all about. You know, for me anyway, and, of course, the Indians. Look. Of all people, you do not want me to tell this story. What is that supposed to mean?\n\nMonica, I think Rachel's here. Okay. Happy Thanksgiving. Not for me. Chip and I broke up.\n\nOh, why Why? What happened? Well, you know how my parents are out of town, and Chip was gonna come over. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd you were gonna give her, you know, your flower. Monica, can you just call it sex? It really creeps me out when you call it that. Okay. And by the way, while we're at it, A guy's thing is not called his tenderness.\n\nBelieve me. Everyone, this is Chandler, my roommate and lead singer of our band. Ken. Ross. Oh, this is Monica.\n\nHi. I'm Ross's little sister. Okay. I'm so glad you could come, Chandler. We got plenty of food, so I hope You're hungry?\n\nOh, mom. No. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food. Oh. Oh, I'm so glad you brought him here then.\n\nChandler, if you want, I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner. Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, then I'm in. Damn it. So, Rach, does it Does it feel weird around here now, you know, since I've been away at college? Oh, no.\n\nNot really. Well, that's cool. So So So that's Rachel, the girl you've been writing all those songs about? Yeah. Might wanna rethink the lyrics to she feels weird since I've been gone.\n\nI cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut, Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. You know? I don't care how much he begs. I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.\n\nYou know what? I've just had it with high school boys. They are just silly. They're just Silly, stupid boys. I'm a start dating men.\n\nI'm sorry, Judy. I Couldn't find that bowl you and Jack were looking for. Call them mom and dad, you loser. What a cook.
