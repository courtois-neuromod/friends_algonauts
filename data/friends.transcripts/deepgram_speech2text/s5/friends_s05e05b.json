Look.\n\nI'm just gonna ask you this one time. Alright? And whatever you say, I'll believe you. Were you or were you not on a gay cruise?

There are plenty of people who just see the sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is is that better? No. It's not better.\n\nI still don't get to see you. Well, what would you do, Rach? If you were me, what what would you do? Well, for starters, I would've said the right name at my wedding.

I just came over to drop off nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked. Yeah.\n\nIt did. So I guess this is over. What? Well, you know, you and me. I mean, it had to end some time.\n\nWhy exactly? Because of the weekend, we had a fight. Chandler, that's crazy. If you give up every time you have a with someone. You'd never be with anyone longer than oh.\n\nSo this isn't over? You were so cute. No. No. It was a fight.\n\nYou deal with it, and you move on. It's nothing to freak out about. Really? Okay. Great.\n\nWelcome to an adult relationship. We're in a relationship? I'm afraid so. Okay.
