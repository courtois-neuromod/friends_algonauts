I love you. Alright. I'll come to New York, and we'll try to make this work. Oh, that is so great. That's that's As long as you don't see Rachel anymore. So I asked Emily if She would come to New York, and she said yes. Oh, boy. No. No. No. Only if I promise never to see Rachel again. What? You can't what did you tell her? I told her I'd have to about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you. Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore. She's one of your best friends. Right. Yeah. But you can't exactly not see Emily. I mean, that's his wife. That's true. Yeah. But you've known Rachel since high school, and you cannot just cut her out of your life. That's true. Cannot. Thanks for the help. Problem solved. Hello. Hey, Ma. Oh, hey, Joey.

You know what, champ? I think I'll pass. Why? Why? What's your point? With all this stupid gloating, would would you wanna sleep with you? Well, I think I'd be a little out of my league, but I'd give it a shot. PBS telethon. Hey, Joey. I just, wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I went down to the park, and I let a bee sting me. What? What good is that gonna do anybody? Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy, and I am definitely not. You know, the bee probably died after he stung Damn it. Back on in 30 seconds, people. Hey. Excuse me. Would you mind switching with me? I'm just no way. I'm in a shot, man. Come on, man. You've been here all day. Yeah. I'm I'm taking pledges here. And we're on in 3, 2 Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque du Soleil and you'd like to see more of the same kind of program, It's very simple. All you have to do is call in that pledge, and at that time, tell the operators, one of our volunteers, What type of program? Quick broiling pan question. Yes. It really does cost that much. Maybe next time your duck can puking something from Pottery Barn. Okay. That's it. I cannot make this decision. It is too difficult, so I am just gonna leave it entirely up to the gods of fate. A magic 8 ball? Oh, you can't be serious. You can't make this decision with a toy. Oh, it's not a toy. Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife And lose one of my my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced for the 2nd time before I'm 30. So so if anyone else has has a better suggestion, Let's hear it because I I got nothing. Alright. Don't be shy. Any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 ball. Should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell? This is broken. It it is broken. Let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me. Okay. One more time. Should I never see Rachel again? Hey. Oh, magic 8 ball. What'd you ask? Do, Rachel, get to pick the movie that we're all going to see tonight. Excellent. What's the answer? Woo hoo. Looks like Stella's gonna get her groove back tonight. What? I heard it was good. PBS telethon. Hi, Joey. Hey, Pheebs. I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200. $200? You sure, Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to you? Oh, I'm still mad at them, But I also know that they bring happiness to lots of kids whose moms didn't kill themselves. You know? So by Reporting them I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So they're a selfless good deed. Alright. And you don't feel a little good about donating the money? No. It sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster. A hamster? What? Those things are like $10. Yeah. Not the one I had my eye on. It looks like we have surpassed Last year's pledge total. Thank you, yours. Yeah. Image that pin it was taken by one of our volunteers. Oh, boy. And may I say, one of our sharpest rest volunteers, mister Joseph Tribbiani. Oh, look. Look. Joey's on TV. Isn't that great? Hey. My pledge got Joey on TV. Oh, that makes me feel so oh, no. Look. Maybe I got carried away before, but there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you made me the best. Keep talking. I mean, that was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask, Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you and we're together, Oh my god. Really? Oh oh my god. Now I understand if you never wanna sleep with me again, But that would be wrong. We're too good. We owe it to sex. Well, we owe it. Oh. Oh my. When is Joy gonna be home?

our plane with her. Again, very sorry. I mean, I can't I can't be in the same room as her. It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her. Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me.\n\nOkay. I love you. Alright. I'll come to New York, and we'll try to make this work. Oh, that is so great.\n\nThat's that's As long as you don't see Rachel anymore. So I asked Emily if She would come to New York, and she said yes. Oh, boy. No. No.\n\nNo. Only if I promise never to see Rachel again. What? You can't what did you tell her? I told her I'd have to about it.\n\nI mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you. Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore. She's one of your best friends. Right.\n\nYeah. But you can't exactly not see Emily. I mean, that's his wife. That's true. Yeah.\n\nBut you've known Rachel since high school, and you cannot just cut her out of your life. That's true. Cannot. Thanks for the help. Problem solved.\n\nHello. Hey, Ma. Oh, hey, Joey. We've been watching all day. When are you gonna be on TV?\n\nSee, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, But I'm still on TV, and that's good exposure. You're not on TV. Oh, okay. How How about now? Yeah.\n\nWhere are you, there it is. Hello, New York. You know? Maybe just, like, wanna put the whole duck right in there. Who cares?\n\nYou know? Now I got the legs. How many times have I told you guys to never watch the Cooking Channel? Hi, Chandler. Hey.\n\nListen. I need that broiling pan that Joy poured the other day. Oh, that was yours? Mhmm. Yeah.\n\nWe used it when the Duck was throwing up caterpillars. William Sonoma. Fall catalog, page 27. Expected in 4 to 6 weeks. Hey.\n\nJoey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, and we have the whole place to ourselves. Yeah. So? Well, I just thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you've ever had. You know what, champ?\n\nI think I'll pass. Why? Why? What's your point? With all this stupid gloating, would would you wanna sleep with you?\n\nWell, I think I'd be a little out of my league, but I'd give it a shot. PBS telethon. Hey, Joey. I just, wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I went down to the park, and I let a bee sting me.\n\nWhat? What good is that gonna do anybody? Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy, and I am definitely not. You know, the bee probably died after he stung Damn it.\n\nBack on in 30 seconds, people. Hey. Excuse me. Would you mind switching with me? I'm just no way.\n\nI'm in a shot, man. Come on, man. You've been here all day. Yeah. I'm I'm taking pledges here.\n\nAnd we're on in 3, 2 Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque du Soleil and you'd like to see more of the same kind of program, It's very simple. All you have to do is call in that pledge, and at that time, tell the operators, one of our volunteers, What type of program? Quick broiling pan question. Yes.\n\nIt really does cost that much. Maybe next time your duck can puking something from Pottery Barn. Okay. That's it. I cannot make this decision.\n\nIt is too difficult, so I am just gonna leave it entirely up to the gods of fate. A magic 8 ball? Oh, you can't be serious. You can't make this decision with a toy. Oh, it's not a toy.\n\nWell, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife And lose one of my my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced for the 2nd time before I'm 30. So so if anyone else has has a better suggestion, Let's hear it because I I got nothing. Alright. Don't be shy.\n\nAny suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 ball. Should I never see Rachel again?\n\nAsk again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell? This is broken.\n\nIt it is broken. Let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.\n\nOkay. One more time. Should I never see Rachel again? Hey. Oh, magic 8 ball.\n\nWhat'd you ask? Do, Rachel, get to pick the movie that we're all going to see tonight. Excellent. What's the answer? Woo hoo.\n\nLooks like Stella's gonna get her groove back tonight. What? I heard it was good. PBS telethon. Hi, Joey.\n\nHey, Pheebs. I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200. $200? You sure, Pheebs?\n\nI mean, after what Sesame Street did to you? Oh, I'm still mad at them, But I also know that they bring happiness to lots of kids whose moms didn't kill themselves. You know? So by Reporting them I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So they're a selfless good deed.\n\nAlright. And you don't feel a little good about donating the money? No. It sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.\n\nA hamster? What? Those things are like $10. Yeah. Not the one I had my eye on.\n\nIt looks like we have surpassed Last year's pledge total. Thank you, yours. Yeah. Image that pin it was taken by one of our volunteers. Oh, boy.\n\nAnd may I say, one of our sharpest rest volunteers, mister Joseph Tribbiani. Oh, look. Look. Joey's on TV. Isn't that great?\n\nHey. My pledge got Joey on TV. Oh, that makes me feel so oh, no. Look. Maybe I got carried away before, but there's something you gotta know.\n\nIf I'm the best, it's only because you made me the best. Keep talking. I mean, that was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask, Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you and we're together, Oh my god.\n\nReally? Oh oh my god. Now I understand if you never wanna sleep with me again, But that would be wrong. We're too good. We owe it to sex.\n\nWell, we owe it. Oh. Oh my. When is Joy gonna be home? Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him.\n\nOh, no. No. No. No. No.\n\nLeave the gloves on. But I just cleaned the bathroom. Yeah. Why don't we lose the gloves? Alright.\n\nLet's show them how it's done. Okay. Ow. You know that wasn't part of it. I know Hi.\n\nYou ready? You're not we're you were gonna be late. For what? For Stella. Remember?\n\nShe's getting her groove back in, like, 20 minutes. Yeah. I I, totally forgot about that. Do you do you mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.\n\nSure. Yes. Hey. I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay.\n\nIt's not that easy. There's still a lot of, relationship stuff. Like what? Just stuff. You know?\n\nKinda what Emily wants. Well, why don't you talk to me about it? Maybe I can help. No. No.\n\nYou You can't help. I mean, kinda have to do this without your help. Well, I I know you can do that too. I'm I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to, I Thanks. Ross, look.\n\nWhatever this relationship stuff is that Emily wants, Just give it to her. Ma, the bottom line is that you love her, so just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just hate yourself if you don't.\n\nOh, come on. Answer it. Strangely crazy. Hello. Hi, sweetie.\n\nGood. Look. Yes. I've been Been thinking about that thing you you wanted me to do, and I can do it. So will you come to New York?\n\nNever done that before.
