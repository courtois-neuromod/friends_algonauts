What's with him? Sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.\n\nOkay. Okay. Let's see what we got here. Oh, you know, Fonzie dated triplets. This this Fonzie person you keep referring to, is that, is that another doctor?\n\nOh, no. No. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzarelli. The funds. Alright.\n\nIt's not that weird, is it? It's very weird. I don't want some guy down there telling me I'm, You know, dilated amundo. To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonseca. Are you doing?\n\nWhy are you defending him? Just get me another doctor, one who is not crazy and does not Fonzie. Again, it's not that he Hi. Hey. Hey.\n\nThere you are. Listen. I I think there's something that you should know. Oh, is this about you you dating a nurse? Yeah.\n\nYeah. Joe already told me, and I am so, so fine.

Really.\n\nI'm fully qualified to Stewie. Doesn't anybody understand that I'm going to be having babies soon? Go. Go, little boy. Go.\n\nOh, go. You made him cry. Mister Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones. Well, what else could it be? It's getting you stones or getting you stones.\n\nIf it was something else Well, that would be kidney stones. Alright. You're getting there. Oh, you know, these babies are very, very lucky. They are?\n\nWhy? They have the honor of being born on the Fonzie's half birthday. Happy birthday. Just just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie. You know, I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing that you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.\n\nNo. It is. Yeah.
