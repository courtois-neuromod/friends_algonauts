I mean, come on. The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here. We're so sorry. Yeah. Well, I'm telling everyone about you. It's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig. No. No. No. There's gotta be a better explanation. You could tell them that you had to make an adult Filmed for your adult film class. Yeah. I like that. But no. No. How does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place? I don't know. Well, get ready to come out of the nongay closet. Hey. Just wait. Please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just just give us a little more time. Alright. Hey. But it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing. The video camera? Nice. Ross, May I have a word with you? Yeah. Of course, Donald. We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part. What? Threatening letters. Refusal to meet deadlines. Apparently, people now call you mental. Yeah. We want you to speak to a psychiatrist. Oh, no. You don't understand. Ugh. This is so silly. This is all just because of a sandwich. A a sandwich? Yeah. You see, my my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is She puts, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle. I call it the moist maker. Anyway, I I put Put my sandwich in the fridge over here. And or or you know what? What? I I'm sorry. I I believe I ate that. You ate my sandwich? I think it was Simple mistake. It could happen to anyone. Oh, really? Did you confuse it with your own Turkey sandwich with a moist maker? No. What? Do you perhaps remember seeing a note On top of it? There may have been a a joke or limerick of some kind. That said, It was my sandwich. Now now calm down. Come look in my office. Some of it may still be in the trash. What? Well, it was quite large. I I I I have to throw most of it away. You you you you threw my sandwich away. My sandwich? My sandwich. Hi. Hi. So, what's this book about? You didn't read this one either? Well, I was gonna, but I, accidentally read something else. What? Vogue. K. So tell me about this Jane Eyre moment. No. You should have read it yourself. Oh, come on, Phoebe. Don't be such a goody goody. Fine. Okay. Alright. So Jane Eyre? Yeah. First of all, you'd think she's a woman. She's not. She's a cyborg. A cyborg? Isn't that like a robot? Yeah. This book It was light years ahead of its time. Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So what did everybody think of Jane Eyre? Rachel and I were just discussing it, and she actually had some very interesting insights. Well, go ahead, Rachel. Thank you, Phoebe. Well, I what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was, how the book was so, ahead of its time. If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right. Yeah. Well, feminism, yes, but also the robots. Hey. Okay. So, Since that video camera thing didn't work out, I thought that I would give you just a little preview. You're naked in this picture. I know. Ross? Hey, Chandler. Monica. Yes. Are you okay? I'm fine. I saw a psychiatrist at work today. Why? On account of my rage. Which if I may say right now is out of control. He gave me a pill for it. A pill? Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me that I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss, I started to get worked up again. So he offered I mean, you're tranquilizer, and I thought it was a good idea, so I took it. Wait a minute. They're making you take time off work? And you're okay with that? I don't know. It's gonna be weird not having a job for a while, but I I definitely don't care about my sandwich. Yeah. You know, I hate it when they make me see the shrink at my office. You know, he's always like, woah. Maybe your colleagues will like you better if you like yourself better. Who needs that? You do. I know. It's just so embarrassing. I can't believe it just let me go on and on and on like that. I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to RoboCop. That was not Funny. I snapped. Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously. Phoebe, come on. What is the big deal? I thought this was gonna be something We could do together. You know? I thought it would be fun. Well, yeah, fun is good, but, you know, I also wanted to learn. You You know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school, and I never went to high school. Oh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah. You know, Steve, I just wanted to have fun. Do you know who you should go with? I know. I know. I know. Monica, you asked the question. Oh my god. That's Monica. Oh, no. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. How come you get away from me, you sick sick sicko. What's going on? Joey has got a Secret peephole. Oh, no. No. No. Yes. He has a naked picture of Monica. He takes naked pictures of us, then he eats chicken, And then he looks at them. Look. Look. Dude, that's my sister. I know. With that. Like, wait. Wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert. No. I am not a pervert. Okay? It's just I just kinda Look. Look. I think I can explain this. Thank you. Joey's a sex addict. What? No. I'm not. It's okay. It's good. It's good. It's a disease. Oh, no. I am not a sex addict. Yes. You are. That's the only way to explain all this stuff. No. It isn't. No. It's not. Because you could also explain it with the truth. Well, what is the truth? Yeah. What what is all going on? I slept with Monica. Well, let's Let's see what everybody thinks of that. Oh, no. You slept with my sister? Yes. But it was we just did it once, in London. This is not good for my rage. Monica. Is this true? Of course, it's true. How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on? Yes. It's true. Okay. But if it only happened that one time, how can we found your underwear in our apartment the other day? That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right, Monica? I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir. My god, Monica. Are you sure, Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict? No. And if anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica. Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London. So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself. That makes sense. And the video camera? Monica? I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey. But, sadly, I I could not be enticed. Monica, this has to stop now. I know. I know. I know. I I will, and I would appreciate it if we all could just, you know, just drop it immediately and forever. Okay. That is if you can resist me. I'll give it my best shot. Good luck. Unbelievable. I mean, you really kept Joey's underwear? Why? Why would you do that? I'm Monica. I'm Disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants. Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Now I'm gonna get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs. I really thought you were making a good point. I mean, you know, till So you got cut off. No. What's up with that girl, Monica? I don't know. I didn't come with her. Hey, everybody. Everybody, guess what? I just convinced Carl to give us a test next week. Test? Come on. Test made us all better learners. Oh, yeah. We should have essay questions.

"\nCareful. I mean, come on. The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here. We're so sorry. Yeah.\n\nWell, I'm telling everyone about you. It's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig. No. No. No.\n\nThere's gotta be a better explanation. You could tell them that you had to make an adult Filmed for your adult film class. Yeah. I like that. But no.\n\nNo. How does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place? I don't know. Well, get ready to come out of the nongay closet. Hey.\n\nJust wait. Please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just just give us a little more time. Alright.\n\nHey. But it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing. The video camera? Nice.\n\nRoss, May I have a word with you? Yeah. Of course, Donald. We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part. What?\n\nThreatening letters. Refusal to meet deadlines. Apparently, people now call you mental. Yeah. We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.\n\nOh, no. You don't understand. Ugh. This is so silly. This is all just because of a sandwich.\n\nA a sandwich? Yeah. You see, my my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is She puts, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle. I call it the moist maker.\n\nAnyway, I I put Put my sandwich in the fridge over here. And or or you know what? What? I I'm sorry. I I believe I ate that.\n\nYou ate my sandwich? I think it was Simple mistake. It could happen to anyone. Oh, really? Did you confuse it with your own Turkey sandwich with a moist maker?\n\nNo. What? Do you perhaps remember seeing a note On top of it? There may have been a a joke or limerick of some kind. That said, It was my sandwich.\n\nNow now calm down. Come look in my office. Some of it may still be in the trash. What? Well, it was quite large.\n\nI I I I have to throw most of it away. You you you you threw my sandwich away. My sandwich? My sandwich. Hi.\n\nHi. So, what's this book about? You didn't read this one either? Well, I was gonna, but I, accidentally read something else. What?\n\nVogue. K. So tell me about this Jane Eyre moment. No. You should have read it yourself.\n\nOh, come on, Phoebe. Don't be such a goody goody. Fine. Okay. Alright.\n\nSo Jane Eyre? Yeah. First of all, you'd think she's a woman. She's not. She's a cyborg.\n\nA cyborg? Isn't that like a robot? Yeah. This book It was light years ahead of its time. Sorry I'm late.\n\nLet's get started. So what did everybody think of Jane Eyre? Rachel and I were just discussing it, and she actually had some very interesting insights. Well, go ahead, Rachel. Thank you, Phoebe.\n\nWell, I what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was, how the book was so, ahead of its time. If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right. Yeah. Well, feminism, yes, but also the robots. Hey.\n\nOkay. So, Since that video camera thing didn't work out, I thought that I would give you just a little preview. You're naked in this picture. I know. Ross?\n\nHey, Chandler. Monica. Yes. Are you okay? I'm fine.\n\nI saw a psychiatrist at work today. Why? On account of my rage. Which if I may say right now is out of control. He gave me a pill for it.\n\nA pill? Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me that I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss, I started to get worked up again. So he offered I mean, you're tranquilizer, and I thought it was a good idea, so I took it. Wait a minute.\n\nThey're making you take time off work? And you're okay with that? I don't know. It's gonna be weird not having a job for a while, but I I definitely don't care about my sandwich. Yeah.\n\nYou know, I hate it when they make me see the shrink at my office. You know, he's always like, woah. Maybe your colleagues will like you better if you like yourself better. Who needs that? You do.\n\nI know. It's just so embarrassing. I can't believe it just let me go on and on and on like that. I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to RoboCop.\n\nThat was not Funny. I snapped. Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously. Phoebe, come on.\n\nWhat is the big deal? I thought this was gonna be something We could do together. You know? I thought it would be fun. Well, yeah, fun is good, but, you know, I also wanted to learn.\n\nYou You know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school, and I never went to high school. Oh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah. You know, Steve, I just wanted to have fun.\n\nDo you know who you should go with? I know. I know. I know. Monica, you asked the question.\n\nOh my god. That's Monica. Oh, no. No. No.\n\nNo. No. No. No. No.\n\nHow come you get away from me, you sick sick sicko. What's going on? Joey has got a Secret peephole. Oh, no. No.\n\nNo. Yes. He has a naked picture of Monica. He takes naked pictures of us, then he eats chicken, And then he looks at them. Look.\n\nLook. Dude, that's my sister. I know. With that. Like, wait.\n\nWait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert. No.\n\nI am not a pervert. Okay? It's just I just kinda Look. Look. I think I can explain this.\n\nThank you. Joey's a sex addict. What? No. I'm not.\n\nIt's okay. It's good. It's good. It's a disease. Oh, no.\n\nI am not a sex addict. Yes. You are. That's the only way to explain all this stuff. No.\n\nIt isn't. No. It's not. Because you could also explain it with the truth. Well, what is the truth?\n\nYeah. What what is all going on? I slept with Monica. Well, let's Let's see what everybody thinks of that. Oh, no.\n\nYou slept with my sister? Yes. But it was we just did it once, in London. This is not good for my rage. Monica.\n\nIs this true? Of course, it's true. How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on? Yes. It's true.\n\nOkay. But if it only happened that one time, how can we found your underwear in our apartment the other day? That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right, Monica? I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.\n\nMy god, Monica. Are you sure, Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict? No. And if anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica.\n\nYeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London. So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself. That makes sense.\n\nAnd the video camera? Monica? I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey. But, sadly, I I could not be enticed. Monica, this has to stop now.\n\nI know. I know. I know. I I will, and I would appreciate it if we all could just, you know, just drop it immediately and forever. Okay.\n\nThat is if you can resist me. I'll give it my best shot. Good luck. Unbelievable. I mean, you really kept Joey's underwear?\n\nWhy? Why would you do that? I'm Monica. I'm Disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.\n\nWell, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Now I'm gonna get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs. I really thought you were making a good point. I mean, you know, till So you got cut off.\n\nNo. What's up with that girl, Monica? I don't know. I didn't come with her. Hey, everybody.\n\nEverybody, guess what? I just convinced Carl to give us a test next week. Test? Come on. Test made us all better learners.\n\nOh, yeah.
