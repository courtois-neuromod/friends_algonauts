You really should wipe it off as something. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building. And I'm gonna sit them all down and explain to them that I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy. I'm just a guy who who stands up for what he believes in, a man with principles. Sounds like a fun party. La Crosse, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the $100? Party's gonna cost you way more than that. That doesn't matter. It's my principles. We're talking about my principles. Okay. I thought it was about your neighbors liking you. Oh, they'll like me once they come to my awesome partay. Okay. I gotta run. I gotta go get some name tags. And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law. Okay. Very, very funny. But don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head. Chandler, you you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head? What? Why? Well, Because she loves you and because you love her. Yeah. So what's that supposed to mean? Hey, Chandler. Don't freak out. I'm telling you something you already know. Come on. She broke up with Richard because he didn't wanna have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and, you know, Monica. I don't see it that way. Okay? Because I see 2 Monicas. The one that was my friend who lives across the hall and wanted to have a lot of babies, And then a new Monica who I just started to date. Okay? Now who's to say what she wants? I'm right. I'm right. Am I right? Oh, absolutely. Okay. And and, you know, I'm completely different than Richard anyway because he's an eye doctor, and I don't wear glasses. No. You're right. You are absolutely right. I mean, that makes everything different. Okay. It's not different at all, is it? Not unless different means the same. You were so funny with that waiter. You're such a nut. You know, breadstick fangs are always funny. So No. You make them funny. You're the funny one. Thanks. Look, Katie. Listen. We we need to talk. Okay? Look. I like you. I I I really do. I I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you when you playfully punch me like that, It it feels like someone's hit me with a very tiny but a very real bat. Oh, Like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size. Isn't this great? Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Don't blur. Can you just stay here forever? Yeah. Up here. Somewhere else. You know? Where wherever. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm cool. Casual. What what are you doing? Well, just hanging out, you know, having fun, you know, with the girl that I'm seeing casually. Man, I knew it. I knew you were going to do this. What? Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff. Well, you you do want all that stuff. Right? Oh, and you know what I want. Yes. You want babies.

Sure. He cared enough to call it first. You're a few steps ahead of us.\n\nYeah. Big zero gravity moon steps. Oh, oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you. Oh, I'll go in on that with you. I couldn't of anything.\n\nOkay? Oh, hey, Katie. Hey, everyone. This is Katie. Hi.\n\nHello, Katie. So you ready to go? Yeah. I just gotta run to the bathroom. Oh, sure.\n\nRight back Hey. Where are we going lunch? I was thinking maybe Chinese food. Oh, I love Chinese. How'd you know I love Chinese?\n\nShe is so cute. You could fit her right in her little pocket. Gina's sitting in that little pocket inside the pocket. I don't know. I mean, I like her a lot.\n\nI mean, she's She's really nice, but For what? She keeps punching me. In the cute little sweet way she just did? Hey. It's a lot harder than it looks.\n\nK? She's She's hurting me. Rosie, I know what you need. You need a bodyguard. Hey, Ross.\n\nWhat is Ben doing after preschool? Okay. Let's see. Come on. Joey is having a problem.\n\nIt's a little girl who's beating him up. Aw, Joey, come here. Look.

Bread, so you never go hungry. Oh.\n\nAnd a scented candle for the bathroom Because Vienna. Thanks. Thanks. And thanks, I guess. Hi.\n\nHi. Welcome to the building. I'm, Steve Serra, president of the tenants committee. Oh, hi. Ross Geller.\n\nAnd, this is my friend Phoebe. Oh, hi, Phoebe. Mister president. I, came to talk to you about Howard. Howard?\n\nYeah. He's the handyman. He's gonna be retiring next week, and everyone who lives here is kicking in a $100 as a kind of a thank you for all the hard work type of thing. Oh, that's nice. Yeah.\n\nSo you wanna give me a check? Or Oh, Oh, look. You don't have to give it to me right now. You can slip it under my door. No.\n\nNo. It's not that. It's just I I I just moved in. Well, the guys worked here for 25 years. Yes.\n\nBut I've lived here for 25 minutes. Oh, okay. I get it. Wait. Look.\n\nLook. I'm sorry. It's just I I've never even met Howard. I I I mean, I don't know Howard. Howard's the handyman?\n\nYes. But to me, he's just man. Okay. Fine. Whatever.\n\nWelcome to the building. Can you believe that guy? Yeah. I really like his glasses. So then president Steve told everyone I was a cheapskate, And now the whole building hates me.\n\nYou know, a little kid spit on my knee and told me to wipe it off with my $100 bill. You really should wipe it off as something. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right.\n\nFor everyone in the building. And I'm gonna sit them all down and explain to them that I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy. I'm just a guy who who stands up for what he believes in, a man with principles. Sounds like a fun party.\n\nLa Crosse, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the $100? Party's gonna cost you way more than that. That doesn't matter. It's my principles. We're talking about my principles.\n\nOkay. I thought it was about your neighbors liking you. Oh, they'll like me once they come to my awesome partay. Okay. I gotta run.\n\nI gotta go get some name tags. And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law. Okay. Very, very funny. But don't say things like that in front of Monica.\n\nI don't want you putting any ideas in her head. Chandler, you you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head? What? Why? Well, Because she loves you and because you love her.\n\nYeah. So what's that supposed to mean? Hey, Chandler. Don't freak out. I'm telling you something you already know.\n\nCome on. She broke up with Richard because he didn't wanna have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and, you know, Monica. I don't see it that way. Okay?\n\nBecause I see 2 Monicas. The one that was my friend who lives across the hall and wanted to have a lot of babies, And then a new Monica who I just started to date. Okay? Now who's to say what she wants? I'm right.\n\nI'm right. Am I right? Oh, absolutely. Okay. And and, you know, I'm completely different than Richard anyway because he's an eye doctor, and I don't wear glasses.\n\nNo. You're right. You are absolutely right. I mean, that makes everything different. Okay.\n\nIt's not different at all, is it? Not unless different means the same. You were so funny with that waiter. You're such a nut. You know, breadstick fangs are always funny.\n\nSo No. You make them funny. You're the funny one. Thanks. Look, Katie.\n\nListen. We we need to talk. Okay? Look. I like you.\n\nI I I really do. I I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you when you playfully punch me like that, It it feels like someone's hit me with a very tiny but a very real bat. Oh, Like I could hurt you.\n\nAre you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size. Isn't this great? Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Don't blur.\n\nCan you just stay here forever? Yeah. Up here. Somewhere else. You know?\n\nWhere wherever. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm cool. Casual.\n\nWhat what are you doing? Well, just hanging out, you know, having fun, you know, with the girl that I'm seeing casually. Man, I knew it. I knew you were going to do this. What?\n\nGet all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff. Well, you you do want all that stuff. Right? Oh, and you know what I want. Yes.\n\nYou want babies. You have baby fever. I do not have baby fever. Oh, please.
