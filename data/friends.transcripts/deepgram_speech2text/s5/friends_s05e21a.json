Do you want anything, baby doll? I'm fine. Thanks. Yeah. See, I can't pull off baby doll, can I? No. I I think we learned that from the sugar lips incident. I made some tea. How you doing, pumpkin? Nope. So it looks like it's going really well for you 2. I know. Really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me. Oh my god. What do what do you think? I think that it's so great. When are you gonna ask her? Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay? I swear. I promise. I promise. My god. I'm so excited. Alright. Listen. Let me tell you. Do not get her flowers. Okay? Because, you know, she cries when they die, and then there's the whole funeral. I'll see you after work, sweetie. Okay. Yeah. Bye. So what movie should we see? Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him. What? Really? He just told me at the counter, he made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer. I can't believe this. Right? Because of fast. Because it's so fast. It's fast. Relax. It's Phoebe, not you. Oh, good for you, Phoebe. Way to go. Oh, but it is Fast, isn't it? No. Oh, I like him a lot, but I don't think I'm ready for this. So what are you gonna do? I don't know. I'll just handle it. I'll ask you to talk to him. Me? Why me? Because you are so afraid of commitment. You talk to him. Make him scared like you. Make him a man. Well, I'll try, But I'm not sure what good it would do, you know, because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be. That is so sweet. Still terrified. I'll take care of it. No problem. Hey, Ross. Is, is Staten Island really an island? Uh-huh. That's why they call it Staten Island. Oh, I thought it was like Long Island. Also an island. Hey. What time is it? 217. Wow. You realize we've been throwing this ball without dropping it for, like, an hour? Are you serious? Yeah. I realized it a half hour ago, but I didn't wanna say anything because I didn't wanna jinx it. Wow. We are pretty good at This. Hey. We totally forgot about lunch. I think that's the first time I've ever missed a meal. Yeah. I think My pants are a little loose. Hey, you guys. Hey. Is Monica here? No. No. Alright. Listen. I just bought something. I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something I've wanted since I was a little girl. You bought Shon't Cassidy. No. I wish. Okay. You ready? Yeah. Okay. Oh my god. What what is What what the hell is that? It's it's a cat. That is not a cat. Yes. It is. Why is it inside out? Excuse me, but this is a purebred, show quality sphinx cat. How much did you pay for that? Well, it was a little extravagant, but I got a pretty good deal. How much? $1,000. On a cat? It's not a cat. For $1,000, you think at least it'd come with hair? Something. Alright. Listen, ball boys. My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl, and it was the sweetest thing. I mean, it was so cute. It would Sit in my lap and just purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground, and it would chase it. Free cats do that too. You know? It's not a cat. You guys, I'm really excited about this. Okay? I don't care what you think. I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for missus Whiskerson. What am I gonna call her? Fluffy? Hey. Do you wanna get something to eat, or, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? The ball thing. Yeah? Hey, Ross. Wouldn't it be great if we could go for, like, 2 straight hours without dropping it? Yeah. It would. Let's do it. Okay. Uh-oh. What? I have to pee, and Rachel's in the bathroom. Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it. I know. Don't switch hands. Okay? Hey, ladies. What are you in here for? Hey, Chandler. What are you doing here? Gary, I am here to report a crime. Yeah? It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together. What's up? Well, I heard that you were thinking about asking need to move in with you, and I thought maybe we should have a talk, you know, man to well me. Sure. Okay. Okay. Are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you 2 are gonna be, you know, living together. Yeah. I I considered that. I just know it'd make me happy. You mean scared? No. I mean happy. Scared, happy. Chandler, what are you doing? I am trying to open your eyes, my man. Don't you see? If you live with Phoebe, she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home. She's there. You go to bed. She's there. You wake up, and, oh, yes. She's there. I know. I can't wait. Were your parents happy or something? Listen, Chandler. The way I see it is I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just I wanna be around her as much as I can. Wow. You know, when you say it, it it doesn't sound so scary. So you know what I'm talking about. Right? Yeah. I think I do. You know what? You move in with her. You move in with her right now. Maybe I should move in with Mark. No. It's too soon for you guys. You're right about that. Now When they found the remains of the Mesozoic mastodon, they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic amphibian in its jaws. How did it get there? Maybe this should be more of a quiet game. Hey, guys. Hey. Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here. Where? Wait. Where is it? I don't know. Alright. Well, come on. I'm I'm late for work. Do you know? You don't have a watch. I don't know. Could you please just stop throwing the ball for 1 minute and just help me find it? Oh, I don't know. Yeah. I can't do it. No. Her. What? Veronica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball. Yeah. We haven't dropped it in 2 hours 27 minutes. Really? I'm I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today. I don't feel very good. Yes. Wow. For a second there, I thought I was feeling better, but I'm not. Hey, Rach. Hey. Check it out. Almost 3 hours without dropping it. Oh, wow. Congratulations. That's quite a waste of time. Rach. Yeah. You have scratches all over you. What what happened? Well, it's my cat. What? Oh, yeah. I got a cat. I don't want a Cat. Oh, don't worry. It's not a cat. Yeah. You guys, this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet. It's not cute. I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but Every time this cat hisses at me, I know it's saying Rachel. Doesn't sound as crazy as paying $1,000 for a cab. You paid a $1,000 for a cab when you owe me 300? Well, I I was gonna let you play with it. K. Did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing? Yes. I did, and I think you should do it. What? He's a great guy, you know, and he loves you a lot. You are a very lucky lady. You are useless. Breaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do. The one thing, and you can't even do that right. God. Sorry. If you ask me, I'd move him to him. Oh. Oh, get out of here. Good for nothing. Hey, Jim. Hey, Gare. Hey, sweetie. Hi. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. K. You look very pretty today. Thanks. Okay. Here's the thing. Yeah. You know, I really want this relationship to move forward. Mhmm. Because if you're not moving forward, you know, you're just moving backwards. Now that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still, and staying still is good. Watch this. Phoebe? Yeah. I want you to move in with me. That is so sweet. But don't you think that it's a little too soon? Mean, there's just so much that we don't know about each other.", "confidence": 0.99871314, "words": [{"word": "i'm", "start": 2.56, "end": 2.72, "confidence": 0.99814045, "punctuated_word": "I'm"},

For $1,000, you think at least it'd come with hair?\n\nSomething. Alright. Listen, ball boys. My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl, and it was the sweetest thing. I mean, it was so cute.\n\nIt would Sit in my lap and just purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground, and it would chase it. Free cats do that too. You know? It's not a cat. You guys, I'm really excited about this.\n\nOkay? I don't care what you think. I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for missus Whiskerson. What am I gonna call her? Fluffy?\n\nHey. Do you wanna get something to eat, or, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? The ball thing. Yeah? Hey, Ross.\n\nWouldn't it be great if we could go for, like, 2 straight hours without dropping it? Yeah. It would. Let's do it. Okay.\n\nUh-oh. What? I have to pee, and Rachel's in the bathroom. Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it. I know.\n\nDon't switch hands. Okay? Hey, ladies. What are you in here for? Hey, Chandler.\n\nWhat are you doing here? Gary, I am here to report a crime. Yeah? It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together. What's up?\n\nWell, I heard that you were thinking about asking need to move in with you, and I thought maybe we should have a talk, you know, man to well me. Sure. Okay. Okay. Are you crazy?\n\nAre you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you 2 are gonna be, you know, living together. Yeah. I I considered that. I just know it'd make me happy.\n\nYou mean scared? No. I mean happy. Scared, happy. Chandler, what are you doing?\n\nI am trying to open your eyes, my man. Don't you see? If you live with Phoebe, she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home. She's there.\n\nYou go to bed. She's there. You wake up, and, oh, yes. She's there. I know.\n\nI can't wait. Were your parents happy or something? Listen, Chandler. The way I see it is I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just I wanna be around her as much as I can.\n\nWow. You know, when you say it, it it doesn't sound so scary. So you know what I'm talking about. Right? Yeah.\n\nI think I do. You know what? You move in with her. You move in with her right now. Maybe I should move in with Mark.\n\nNo. It's too soon for you guys. You're right about that. Now When they found the remains of the Mesozoic mastodon, they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic amphibian in its jaws. How did it get there?\n\nMaybe this should be more of a quiet game. Hey, guys. Hey. Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here.\n\nWhere? Wait. Where is it? I don't know. Alright.\n\nWell, come on. I'm I'm late for work. Do you know? You don't have a watch. I don't know.\n\nCould you please just stop throwing the ball for 1 minute and just help me find it? Oh, I don't know. Yeah. I can't do it. No.\n\nHer. What? Veronica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball. Yeah. We haven't dropped it in 2 hours 27 minutes.\n\nReally? I'm I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today. I don't feel very good. Yes. Wow.\n\nFor a second there, I thought I was feeling better, but I'm not. Hey, Rach. Hey. Check it out. Almost 3 hours without dropping it.\n\nOh, wow. Congratulations. That's quite a waste of time. Rach. Yeah.\n\nYou have scratches all over you. What what happened? Well, it's my cat. What? Oh, yeah.\n\nI got a cat. I don't want a Cat. Oh, don't worry. It's not a cat. Yeah.\n\nYou guys, this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet. It's not cute. I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but Every time this cat hisses at me, I know it's saying Rachel.\n\nDoesn't sound as crazy as paying $1,000 for a cab. You paid a $1,000 for a cab when you owe me 300? Well, I I was gonna let you play with it. K. Did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?\n\nYes. I did, and I think you should do it. What? He's a great guy, you know, and he loves you a lot. You are a very lucky lady.\n\nYou are useless. Breaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do. The one thing, and you can't even do that right. God. Sorry.\n\nIf you ask me, I'd move him to him. Oh. Oh, get out of here. Good for nothing. Hey, Jim.\n\nHey, Gare. Hey, sweetie. Hi. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah.\n\nK. You look very pretty today. Thanks. Okay. Here's the thing.\n\nYeah. You know, I really want this relationship to move forward. Mhmm. Because if you're not moving forward, you know, you're just moving backwards. Now that's not true.\n\nIf you're not moving forward, you're just staying still, and staying still is good. Watch this. Phoebe? Yeah. I want you to move in with me.\n\nThat is so sweet. But don't you think that it's a little too soon?
