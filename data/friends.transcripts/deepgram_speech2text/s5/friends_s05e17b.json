Will you excuse me for just a second? Yeah. Okay. Taylor, can I see you for a second? Yeah. Okay. We have got to beat them. Why? Because Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are. Oh, So? So? So we've gotta go upstairs and have a lot of sex and prove them wrong. We we have to got To stop this competitive thing. Okay? It's crazy. I mean, just to impress Gary and Phoebe, you want me to go upstairs and have sex with you over and over and over, and I'm saying no to this. Why? Get your coat. You should check this out.

That's, quite alright, but I feel Obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped. Okay. Well, first, I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and, for yelling at you. Fair enough. Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who, who did who did not yell at you And storm out. And I think that's a big big mistake, and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself, and I came back. That shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And I was not afraid to stand up for myself, And that shows courage. K. Now I I know that I I've already said courage, But, you know, you gotta have courage. And, and finally, when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no, and I was not litigious. So there you go. You got you got courage. You got integrity. You got Courage again and not litigious. Look, mister Zellner. Zellner. I knew that. Oh, I knew that. I really, really want this job, and I think I think I would be really good at it. You know what?

You you have a A twig in your hair. Oh, we kinda took a little detour on our way over here. We were taking a little stroll through the park, and no one was around. So You didn't? We did. We violated section 12 paragraph 7 of the criminal code. The BARC? Public place? Mhmm. I hear you. Can you excuse me for a second? Hi, Chandler. Monica, this is the men's room. Isn't it? Yes. It is. I've I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual, haven't you? No. And if I did, I don't I don't think we'd be going out. Look, you know, I don't wanna disappoint you, and I really don't wanna disappoint the guy in the 2nd stall. Sorry, man. Come on. This is getting ridiculous. But can't let them win? We have already proved that we are hot. Okay? So why why are you getting so obsessed about this thing? Because Phoebe and Gary are in that can't keep their hands off each other doing it in the park phase. So? So? It's been really sad that we're not really there anymore. Oh, wow. Is that what this has all been about? Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were, you know, all over each other all the time? Oh, yeah. That was great. That was really great. But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are now. Really? Yeah. I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. You know? And to get past the beginning and still wanna be around each other all the time, Well, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is all happening with you, yeah, I think that's pretty exciting. That's so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy, but, I feel the same way. Mhmm. You know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship. I did not. Yes. You did. Admit it. You freaked out. Okay. I freaked out a little. A little? You freaked out big time. Okay? And I fixed it. We have switched places. I am the relationship king, and you are the crazy, irrational screw And now we're back. I cannot The Libra is fine then. Thank god. I can't watch him anymore.

I do not want this job that bad. Good day, sir. You're going in there to see mister Zellner. I hope you're ready to put out.\n\nI am. You are not gonna believe what that Sleezeball from Ralph Lauren did to me. I did. Okay. Okay.\n\nThat's That's amazing. How did you know that? You got ink on your lip. Oh, Okay. So what do you say maybe, Sometime, I I hold your gun.\n\nI don't know, man. We're really not supposed to do that. What could happen? I mean, we just Yeah. I'm a say no.\n\nSo, Pia, do you wanna go see a movie after dinner tonight? Oh, we can't. We already have plans. Okay. What are you doing?\n\nWell, same thing we did all day, just hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing. We never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie. Oh, we're not seeing a movie.\n\nYou're not, then why did you ask us if we wanted to go? Oh, that's because I just, you know, wanted to know what you guys are doing so, you know, you wouldn't walk again on me and Chandler while we were, you know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second? Yeah. Okay.\n\nTaylor, can I see you for a second? Yeah. Okay. We have got to beat them. Why?\n\nBecause Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are. Oh, So? So? So we've gotta go upstairs and have a lot of sex and prove them wrong. We we have to got To stop this competitive thing.\n\nOkay? It's crazy. I mean, just to impress Gary and Phoebe, you want me to go upstairs and have sex with you over and over and over, and I'm saying no to this. Why? Get your coat.\n\nYou should check this out. Tell the other tenants. Apparently, he's running around looking for some kinda hot girl. Who isn't? I don't think we've met.\n\nI'm I'm Ross. I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman. Never mind. No.\n\nI actually thought it was really unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean, you had just moved in. I had just moved in. Thank you. Listen.\n\nJen. Jen. I know this may sound a little, but, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime? Or Sure. That would be nice.\n\nMy number's on there. Okay. Give me a call. I will give you a call. I'll see you later.\n\nOkay. I forgot my paper. That was amazing. Phoebe and Gary are So gonna hear about this at dinner. That was amazing.\n\nWe are the hottest. No one is hotter than we are. We're the best. No. You're the best.\n\nNow you're the best. No. You're the best. I am the best. Hey, guys.\n\nWhat you've been doing? Hey, Joey. Isn't that the girl who waved at you the other day? I don't know, but I can see through your sheet. Yeah.\n\nYeah. That's her. But you know what? It doesn't matter. I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.\n\nWhy? Because it's impossible to find her apartment. She lives in, like, some hot girl parallel universe Something. What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the 2nd floor, 7th apartment from the left.\n\nNo. No. No. She lives on the 3rd floor, 8th apartment from the left. No.\n\nThose first two windows, that's the lobby. And you know that other one over there, that's the stairway. They're counting wrong. I did not know that. Thank you, Monica.\n\nI can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting. So, you ready? Yeah. I'll just get my coat. Okay.\n\nCould you get that? Sure. No. No. First, I I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.\n\nThat's, quite alright, but I feel Obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped. Okay. Well, first, I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and, for yelling at you. Fair enough. Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who, who did who did not yell at you And storm out.\n\nAnd I think that's a big big mistake, and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself, and I came back. That shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity.\n\nAnd I was not afraid to stand up for myself, And that shows courage. K. Now I I know that I I've already said courage, But, you know, you gotta have courage. And, and finally, when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no, and I was not litigious. So there you go.\n\nYou got you got courage. You got integrity. You got Courage again and not litigious. Look, mister Zellner. Zellner.\n\nI knew that. Oh, I knew that. I really, really want this job, and I think I think I would be really good at it. You know what? Yeah.\n\nI may regret this, but, I'm gonna give you a shot. Oh, you are. Mhmm. Oh, thank you. Oh god.\n\nOh, would it be completely inappropriate if I gave you a hug? Yes. Okay. Well, then how about a handshake? Oh, god.\n\nI'm Alright. Oh, god. I'm sorry. I did not mean to touch that. I mean, you.\n\nThere. There. Okay. So thank thank you. I'm gonna leave.\n\nThank you very much. Thank you so hey. I'll I'll see you Monday. Are you tired, Chandler? You better believe he's tired after the day we had, If you know what I mean.\n\nYou know what I mean? Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean. So, Chandler, do you like that badge I got you? Oh, yeah. It's so cool.\n\nNow I gotta go. Officer Bing's got 10100. It's pee pee. You you have a A twig in your hair. Oh, we kinda took a little detour on our way over here.\n\nWe were taking a little stroll through the park, and no one was around. So You didn't? We did. We violated section 12 paragraph 7 of the criminal code. The BARC?\n\nPublic place? Mhmm. I hear you. Can you excuse me for a second? Hi, Chandler.\n\nMonica, this is the men's room. Isn't it? Yes. It is. I've I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual, haven't you?\n\nNo. And if I did, I don't I don't think we'd be going out. Look, you know, I don't wanna disappoint you, and I really don't wanna disappoint the guy in the 2nd stall. Sorry, man. Come on.\n\nThis is getting ridiculous. But can't let them win? We have already proved that we are hot. Okay? So why why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?\n\nBecause Phoebe and Gary are in that can't keep their hands off each other doing it in the park phase. So? So? It's been really sad that we're not really there anymore. Oh, wow.\n\nIs that what this has all been about? Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were, you know, all over each other all the time? Oh, yeah. That was great. That was really great.\n\nBut to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are now. Really? Yeah. I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. You know?\n\nAnd to get past the beginning and still wanna be around each other all the time, Well, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is all happening with you, yeah, I think that's pretty exciting. That's so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy, but, I feel the same way. Mhmm.\n\nYou know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship. I did not. Yes. You did.\n\nAdmit it. You freaked out. Okay. I freaked out a little. A little?\n\nYou freaked out big time. Okay? And I fixed it. We have switched places. I am the relationship king, and you are the crazy, irrational screw And now we're back.\n\nI cannot The Libra is fine then. Thank god. I can't watch him anymore. You guys ready for the movies? Yeah.\n\nOh, by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmeid. What?
