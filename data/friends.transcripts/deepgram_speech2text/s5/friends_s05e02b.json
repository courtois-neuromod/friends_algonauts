I make your decisions, and I say I'm not fired. Well Rachel, come on.\n\nLet me in. Having some trouble? Rachel locked the door. I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar. There's something I wanna talk to you about.\n\nI just need this. Rachel, open this door. What is it, locked? Gee, she's fine. Listen.\n\nRachel, I can do this all night if I have to. Do you want me to get that? No. You know what? Just just let her do her thing, and we'll do our thing because I really need to tell you.\n\nThank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec? No. I really need to talk to you. Well, then talk?\n\nOkay. I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do? Yes. What thing?\n\nWell, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons, which I think is a really stupid idea. It's dangerous. She's never going to get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting. Monica's right. Swing dancing can be tricky.\n\nI'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those 5 giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My god. Think of the massacre. I'm gonna do it.\n\nAlright. Rachel, okay. I know I know you think I'm crazy, but, please, before you tell him you love him, just just try to find 1 person Who thinks this is a good idea? Because I bet you you can't. But I Please.\n\nAlright. Fine. Joey, I'm in. Alright. Good deal.\n\nHi. Hey, Britney. So did you find anyone who agrees with you yet? No. But you know what?\n\nI think I think I need a male point of view. Joey, you're a man. You got that right. Now do you think it would be a good idea if I told Ross that I was still in love with him Nope. Thanks.\n\nHey, Lees. Hey. Hey. Hey. Okay.\n\nPheebs? Yeah. You know how the other day you were talking how you didn't get to go to London and you were kinda feeling left out? Yeah. Alright.\n\nWell, we all felt really bad about that, so We decided that we should all take a little trip together. Oh, that's so nice. How great. Where? Where's the trip?\n\nWell, we thought we would all go to a picnic in Central Park. Central Park? Yeah. All of us all day. That sucks.\n\nThat's not a trip. I just came from the park. What do we get a high five about at the stupid Central Park? Oh, it's right by my house. Alright.\n\nWell, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. Hey. Woah. Hold on a sec there, mister Kissy. You know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole little new European thing you've got going on, and I just need to tell you, it makes me very uncomfortable, and I just, you know, just stop it.\n\nI was just trying to bring a little culture to the group. That's fine. Just don't bring it in my mouth. Makes me wanna puke. Hey, everybody.\n\nPhoebe is here. Phoebe. Hey, Phoebe. Phoebe. Hey, honey.\n\nWoo. Okay. Woo. Hi. Okay.\n\nPheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little you know, it didn't have any it it, well, it blew. So we thought that this afternoon, we would all go away for the whole weekend To Atlantic City. Oh, Atlantic City? Oh, that's a great plan. Whose plan was that?\n\nMine. Wait. It was my plan. No. I said we needed a new plan.\n\nAnd I came up with Atlantic City. Which is the new plan? Okay. Well, why don't we, all the upstairs in an hour? Okay.\n\nAlright. I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off. Well, I think I'm gonna grab some coffee because my ass is already packed. Come on, Rex.\n\nLet's go. Yeah. You know what? I'm gonna I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute. No, Rachel.\n\nYou didn't find anyone, So you can't tell him? Well, you know what? That doesn't matter. Okay, Rachel. Do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?\n\nI can't I I don't care. Okay. I I can't watch. What you reading? Paper.\n\nYeah. What's it about? Events from around the globe. K. Ross, you know what?\n\nThere's something, that I have to talk to you about, and everybody's been saying that I shouldn't tell you, but, I think they're wrong. I mean, you know how people can be wrong. Sure. But once at work, I I thought carbon dating is fossilized out. Really trying to tell you something here.\n\nYeah. Okay. Go ahead. Okay. I think I'm I'm just gonna I'm just gonna say it.\n\nJust gonna say it. I'm still in love with you, Ross. Wow. I'm I'm well, I'm not sure what to do with that right now. What?\n\nWas that a joke? Because it's mean. I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious. Why are you laughing?\n\nBecause I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous. I mean, you're married. You you're married, and it's just Ridiculous. And it's like it's like when I said it, I just sort of, like, I floated up out of my body.\n\nYou know? And and and then and then I heard myself say it, and then the floating rage. I was like, you are such an idiot. Well, I am married. Bad dog.\n\nEven though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding. I'm sorry. That's not funny. Actually, it it kind of is. My wife won't return my calls.\n\nI don't know where my wife is. Hey, Ross. Where's the missus? Going on. Oh god.\n\nOkay. You know what? Do you think, do you think you could just kinda forget that I told you this? Well, I kinda have to. I mean, because the thing is Well, the thing is, you know, that you're married to Emily.\n\nThat is what the thing is. Oh, god. I think, Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us. Right? I mean, was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?\n\nNo. No. God. I'm I'm glad you did. Look.\n\nIf if nothing else, it's it's always great when someone tells you they love you. That's what I said. Ross, thank you for being so nice. No. Thank you for Thank you.\n\nOh, god. I'm just glad I didn't give you the cassette I made of all of our songs. What? What, what songs? Oh, you know, with or without you.\n\nOh. Uh-huh. Yeah. Everybody hurts. Oh.\n\nYeah. Rhiannon. Why why Rhiannon? Come on. You remember?\n\nIn in the living room, on Monica's laundry. Not me. Really? So what happened? Well, it was really hard, but, I'm glad I did it.\n\nSo was I right or or wrong? Well, Oh, come on, honey. Does it really matter? No. Right?\n\nYes. I need it for my score book. Diary. Okay. Let's go.\n\nHey. Atlantic City. Come on. Atlantic City, baby. Roll some bones.\n\nHey, Joey. High five for rolling bones. Oh. Oh. Feet, you're leaking.\n\nOh my god. Your water broke. Oh. Don't worry. I called Shotgun.\n\nPete, we have to take you to the hospital now. Okay. Yeah. Well, there's probably 1 on the way to Atlantic City. The babies are coming now.\n\nHoney, high five. The babies are coming. Woo. Woo. Woo.\n\nWait. Wait. Remember when my water pressed? Can't believe Amy's gonna have her babies. I know.\n\nIt's Beautiful and amazing. You know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left the room. I mean, it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
