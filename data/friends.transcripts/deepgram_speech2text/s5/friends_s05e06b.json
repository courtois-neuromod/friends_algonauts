I love this place. To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move. Are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this? Well, I mean, if, if Emily gave me a choice You do have a choice.\n\nRoss, why are you listening to her? Are are you crazy? What? Well, it's not right what Emily wants you to do. She is totally stop pinching me.\n\nLook. Now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy. Right? Well, he just told me that he's not entirely happy. What's going on?\n\nWe all hate Emily. No. No. Ross, we do not hate Emily. We we just we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.\n\nYeah. But we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable. Yes. Yes. Unreasonable.\n\nUnreasonable. How about we have this conversation when 1 of you guys gets married? You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work. It's about compromise. Do you always like it?\n\nNo. Do you do it? Yes. Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Park all the time. It's real life.\n\nOkay? It's what grown ups do. I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffee house way too much. God.\n\nI feel so guilty about Ross. Yes. I know. I kinda feel like it's my fault. Kind of.\n\nIf you just kept this to yourself, none of this would have happened. Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days. Something was bound to slip out. Well, I think it's very brave what you said. I can't sit here anymore.\n\nI have to walk places. Deeds, what are you doing with the code? How about the whole animal Sting. Well, I've been reading up. And for your information, minks are not very nice.\n\nSo they deserve to be killed? Well, they are real bad. Okay. I admit it. I love this coat.\n\nOkay. I it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley. Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine. Hi.\n\nSo you like the short hair better? What? Getting Danny? Had to cut my hair to get rid of the, Fogg or smell. Oh, listen.\n\nI'm so sorry. I would I would have never fogged you, you know, if you hadn't looked so You know, Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances. What? That's cool.\n\nThat's cool. Woah. Hey. Woah. Woah.\n\nNo. No. No. That is not cool. You you don't even know me.\n\nCome on. You got the shopping bags and the sax catalog. And So from that, you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't. You know, I I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here.\n\nTo be? Well, you know, if if kids like to play with Capri pants. Okay. And stop saying that. I hate that.\n\nOkay. Fine. I judged you. I made a snap judgment, but you did it too, and you're worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgment. You can't even open up your mind for a 2nd, to see that you might be wrong.\n\nWhat does that say about you? My pizza place across the street ain't good. What? I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza?\n\nYou can keep yelling if there's more. Okay. Okay. Stop saying that. I hate that.\n\nRoss? Are you still mad at us? Yep. Oh, good. Because we have an I'm sorry song.\n\nYou know what? I'm really not in the mood. Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff, and I just acted like a jerk. Yeah.\n\nWe are so sorry. But you're kinda stepping on the sun. We were way out of line. Alright? We totally support you.\n\nYeah. Whatever you decide, whatever you do. Okay. Now you're just taking mines right out of the sun. This is hard enough.\n\nOkay? I really need you guys right now. Yes. Exactly. And that's why why don't you come over tonight, and I'll make you your favorite dinner?\n\nCome on. Okay. Thanks, you guys. Phoebes, are you wearing fur? Okay.\n\nLet's get some perspective, people. It's not like I'm wearing a Seeing Eye dog coat. Hey. You know, Ross, I, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today. You do, Yeah.\n\nYou see, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface. You know? You know what I'm saying?\n\nI got a lot of balls in the air. You know what I mean? It's tough. Guys like me, you know, you wander around. You're alone.\n\nWhat are you talking about? I'm not sure. Hi. Hey. Look at you.\n\nWhere'd you been? Oh, I went to have pizza with Danny. Oh, how did that happen? That Yeti is 1 smooth talker. Babies are smooth talkers.\n\nThat's why you never see any pictures of them. Come here, baby. Give me the camera. I hope you're not too full because dinner's almost ready. Yeah.\n\nYou know, I I think I'm probably just gonna hang out in my room. Alright. My boy. Come on, you guys. Listen.\n\nIf Emily knew I was here having dinner with you, she would flip out, and you know it. It's okay. I really I don't mind. Wait. Wait.\n\nWait. You know what? Just stay, please. It would really mean a lot for me if you stay. Ross, I just Rachel, please.\n\nJust have dinner with us. Okay. Okay, Joey. It's okay. Settle down.\n\nAlright. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see, rage, I'm an actor. Hey.\n\nHey. Look. The ugly naked guy's back. We haven't seen wow. This is so weird.\n\nI just realized this may be the last time we're all hanging out together. It's almost as if he knew. I'll get it. Hello? Hi, Emily.\n\nYeah. You you tracked him down. Hold on one second. Hey. Yeah.\n\nYeah. We're, we're just we're just having dinner. Yeah. Oh, sure. Hold on.\n\nShe wants to say hi. Hold on. Hi, Emily. Hi. Hello, everyone.\n\nSo who am I saying hello to? Well, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here, and that's Rachel. Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now. You know what?\n\nRachel is here. She's there. Oh, yeah. There there she is. Yeah.\n\nYeah. She's here. Ross, take me off speakerphone. Hi. How could you do this to me?\n\nI thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear. Look, Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends. Okay? You obviously You can't keep away from her. Emily, that's ridiculous.\n\nHello? Hello? Who is this? It's Ross. What are you doing?\n\nSorry, dude. I I had to make a call. Joey. Joey, they don't have 2 lines. They have 2 phones.\n\nGotcha. I'm sorry. Emily Listen. I have never I cheated on you. Look.\n\nI'm I'm moving for you. I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay. You'll see.\n\nYou're the only person I wanna be with. I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time. Well, it it can't know where I am all the time. Look. This marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.\n\nYou're right. So can you trust me? No. I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.\n\nHow can you tell? I can only see the back of his head. You could totally tell. Yeah. Here.\n\nLook. Watch me. Smile. Frown. Smile.\n\nFrown. Well, I guess that's it. Why? What what what happened? My marriage is over.\n\nWhat? Oh, look at you. You're shivering. Here. Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?\n\nYeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther. Okay. Stop tormenting me.
