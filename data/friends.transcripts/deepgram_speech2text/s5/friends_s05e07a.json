No. Look. That's a pig. I know. I know. But look at the knobs on it. Hey. Hey. Emily's cousin kicked me out. What? Why? Well, When you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back. How can I do that? Didn't you sign a lease? Who needs a lease when family. Hey. You can stay with us. We'll take care of it. Absolutely. Anything you need, man. But you have to promise me you will let us know the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair. We got it. Okay. Thanks, you guys. I really appreciate this. Alright. Well, I'm gonna get packing again. Wow. I've been moving around so much lately. Beginning to feel like a nomad. Yeah. What? He thought you said gonad. Wow, Monica.

I was just kidding. Okay. You check the kitchen floor. Okay. Knock yourself out, Larry. I don't get violations. You could eat beans off that floor, but don't because that'd be a violation. Yummy. Larry? Oh, yeah. I learned to check out my kitchen floors. A 98. I deducted 2 points because you're not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a section 5 violation. Oh, Look, Larry, honey. I wrote the book on section 5, and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen. And where is your hat? It's in the kitchen. I'll go get it. That there's the 2 points. Hey. You should really that book you wrote. Wow. You saw the hat in the kitchen, and you knew she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own, you know, inspector detective show. Oh, I don't know about that. Yeah. But then I could be your sidekick, Wounda. Maybe, Vuna could give me her number, and I could ask her to dinner sometime. Okay. She would love that, you know, since you know all the clean places to eat. I'll call you. Okay. He's so funny. Oh. Oh. Thank you. Ron, how's Ross doing? You know, since all the Emily stuff. He's not great, but, he's dealing with Oh, wait a minute. You're not gonna try. Honey, please. No. I can't get started with all that raw stuff again. I mean, he's gonna be screwed up for a long time.

So so there is no party? Oh, no. There's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. Do you follow me? I think so. So he he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you. Exactly. Then why didn't he invite me? Oh, To throw me off. Ross? Hey, roomies. Lovely. You done with the place. Oh, yeah. I know. I know. It's a lot of boxes, but, again, I I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here. Not a problem. And listen. Hey.

So the ball is in his court? Ball? No. There's no ball. Hey, Pheebs. You wanna join us? Oh, sure. Yeah. Where is this from? It's from Sun Lings. Oh. Larry just told me something about Sun Lings.

tribeswomen? No. Look. That's a pig. I know.\n\nI know. But look at the knobs on it. Hey. Hey. Emily's cousin kicked me out.\n\nWhat? Why? Well, When you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back. How can I do that? Didn't you sign a lease?\n\nWho needs a lease when family. Hey. You can stay with us. We'll take care of it. Absolutely.\n\nAnything you need, man. But you have to promise me you will let us know the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair. We got it. Okay. Thanks, you guys.\n\nI really appreciate this. Alright. Well, I'm gonna get packing again. Wow. I've been moving around so much lately.\n\nBeginning to feel like a nomad. Yeah. What? He thought you said gonad. Wow, Monica.\n\nIf every restaurant were as clean as yours, it'd be a tough time making a living. Oh, Larry. So, do health inspectors work on commission? No. Bribes.\n\nIt's okay to laugh. Right? Yeah. I was just kidding. Okay.\n\nYou check the kitchen floor. Okay. Knock yourself out, Larry. I don't get violations. You could eat beans off that floor, but don't because that'd be a violation.\n\nYummy. Larry? Oh, yeah. I learned to check out my kitchen floors. A 98.\n\nI deducted 2 points because you're not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a section 5 violation. Oh, Look, Larry, honey. I wrote the book on section 5, and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen. And where is your hat? It's in the kitchen.\n\nI'll go get it. That there's the 2 points. Hey. You should really that book you wrote. Wow.\n\nYou saw the hat in the kitchen, and you knew she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own, you know, inspector detective show. Oh, I don't know about that. Yeah. But then I could be your sidekick, Wounda.\n\nMaybe, Vuna could give me her number, and I could ask her to dinner sometime. Okay. She would love that, you know, since you know all the clean places to eat. I'll call you. Okay.\n\nHe's so funny. Oh. Oh. Thank you. Ron, how's Ross doing?\n\nYou know, since all the Emily stuff. He's not great, but, he's dealing with Oh, wait a minute. You're not gonna try. Honey, please. No.\n\nI can't get started with all that raw stuff again. I mean, he's gonna be screwed up for a long time. And besides, you know, I don't I don't go for guys right after they get divorced. Right. You only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.\n\nPounds of mocha jama, please. Danny, are you guys ever gonna go out again? I don't know. He hasn't called me since that one time we went out. I see him in the hallway.\n\nWe flirt. I'm all Danny. Hi, Danny. Wow. Thirsty.\n\nOh, actually actually, I'm having a party at my place on, Saturday. Sort of a housewarming kinda thing. Oh. Oh, fun. Great.\n\nI'm really looking forward to it. Yeah. Okay. See you. Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.\n\nOkay. Alright. Now I see what he's doing. He's not asking me out because he wants me to ask him out. And you're not gonna do that?\n\nThat's right. Because that would give him the control. So now he's all, oh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing, you know, to get me to hint around for an invitation? Blew up in his face, didn't it? So so there is no party?\n\nOh, no. There's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. Do you follow me?\n\nI think so. So he he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you. Exactly. Then why didn't he invite me? Oh, To throw me off.\n\nRoss? Hey, roomies. Lovely. You done with the place. Oh, yeah.\n\nI know. I know. It's a lot of boxes, but, again, I I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here. Not a problem. And listen.\n\nHey. Since you're gonna be here for a while, what I was thinking we, put your name on the answer machine. Oh, yeah. Oh, I, hope you don't mind, but I kind of already jazzed it up a little. Check it out.\n\nWe will we will call you back. Pretty cool. I wish. You're fake laughing too. Right?\n\nCheers are real. You look beautiful this evening. Show me the badge again. Shiny. Will you mind if I wash up?\n\nBecause I came straight from working. Who knows where these babies have been? You are just nonstop. We're out of here. Why?\n\nJust walking past the kitchen, I saw 10 violations. I am shutting this place You have the power to do that? This does. Shut it down. Hey.\n\nWhat are you doing? Nothing. You built a fort, didn't you? Kinda. Oh my god.\n\nThe air purifier. Ross's air purifier. All I heard for 4 years through college was Dude, you shoulda gone out once in a while. I hate this thing. Come on, Chandler.\n\nRoss is our friend. Okay? He needs us right now. So why don't you be a grown up and come watch some TV in the 4th? Can't believe that Larry closed down Sherman's.\n\nI love that place. Yeah. I know. But you should have heard about all their violations. Larry said that, they should call it vermins.\n\nThat guy just plain kills me. Oh, hi, Danny. Hey, guys. Just wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night. Oh, thanks.\n\nTry to stop by. Yeah. Actually, I think I'm gonna be busy. You are? Mhmm.\n\nYeah. Remember, I've got sent, gala. And what's a gala for? It's a, It's, it's a Regatta gala. Really?\n\nDid you say them? No. No. But I support it. Okay.\n\nWell, Hope I see you tomorrow night. Okay. Take care. Okay. Walked right into that one, didn't What one?\n\nYou you wanted him to invite you to the party, and he did. Yeah. But he waited until the last minute. So if I said yes, He would know that I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said no, which puts me right back in the driver's seat.\n\nRight. So the ball is in his court? Ball? No. There's no ball.\n\nHey, Pheebs. You wanna join us? Oh, sure. Yeah. Where is this from?\n\nIt's from Sun Lings. Oh. Larry just told me something about Sun Lings. Oh, no. Thank you.\n\nJoey, please. Sorry. Hello, children. Hey. Wanna play some foosball, please?\n\nOkay. No. No. Nope. We had to move the table into my room, yeah, because of all the boxes.\n\nCome on. Alright. I have 1 question. What is the deal with this? Bye bye, little puppet Joey hand?\n\nThe quiet down thing? You mean this? Look. I I I don't know how much more this I can take. Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs?\n\nMy god. What if that had been porn? Alright. Look.
