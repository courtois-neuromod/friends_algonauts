Oh, you get used to it.\n\nYou know, I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things. So I laugh at my boss's jokes. What's the big deal? I'd rather not hang out with this sniveling work weasel guy when when I could be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.\n\nI had to apologize for Cara's coffee. You know? Feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight. It's not strong enough to defend itself. You hear what I said, Bing?\n\nWhat? It's a joke, Bing. What's the matter with you? Well, I I I just didn't think it was funny, sir. Excuse me?\n\nWell, I I just Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke. Really? Yeah. I mean, it was really funny. I I just don't think that you got it.\n\nYou see, Karas coffee is is is weak tasting. Okay. What what Doug did was was implied that it was weak physically. You get it now, honey?

Sometimes I feel No. No.\n\nNo. No. No. No. I'm going to talk.\n\nI believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun. What? You're a very sweet person, Ross. Unfortunately, I just don't think I can take another second of your whining. Let me make sure I'm hearing this right.\n\nYou're ending this with me because I'm too whining? So you're saying I've become so whiny that I annoy you, Janice. Well, yeah. Oh my God. Are you gonna be okay?\n\nI am now. Okay. Hi. Oh, hi. Wow.\n\nI guess that's 2 out of 3. Don't we? Dude, we gotta talk. Okay. I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else, and I hope this isn't too weird.\n\nBut, I had a a thing with Janice. Well, you you're not mad? Why would I be mad? Well, because, you know, there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't, you don't fool around with your friends' Ex girlfriends or, possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.\n\nI am mad. Well, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you Because that's what friends do. They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all the things on the list there.
