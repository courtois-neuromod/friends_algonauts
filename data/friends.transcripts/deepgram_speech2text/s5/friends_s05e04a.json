What about you having those babies for your brother? Talk about self. What what are you talking about? Well, yeah. It was a really nice thing and all, but it It made you feel really good. Right? Yeah. So? Well, it made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look. There's no unselfish good deed. Sorry. Yes. There are. There are totally good deeds that are selfless. Well, may I ask for one example? Yeah. It's you know, there's No. You may not. That's because all people are selfish. Are you calling me selfish? Are you calling you people? Yeah.

What what what are you gonna do? I don't know. I mean, I can't leave Ben. Well, you could just video conference with him. I'm not ready to have a child. I bet if I Talk to Carol and Susan. I could convince them to move to London with Ben. Yeah. I'm sure your ex wife would be more than happy to move to another country so You can patch things up with your new wife. What could happen? Ross, we are We're not moving to London. We already have lives here. Yeah. But but, yeah, but it'd be great. They they have great theater, great accents, Tea? They have a queen. So? She's she's a woman. In. Hey. Hey. Hey. Guess what? We're moving to London. Yes. Who's going to London? Nobody's going to London. Oh, welcome to London, governor. Right. Right. Hey.

That's great, but, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls. No. You answer it and take pledges. But I'm the host. No. Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phone. You don't seem to understand. See, I was doctor Drake Ramores. Well, here's your phone, doctor. I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed. You know that really old guy that lives next door to me? Well, I snuck over there and and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop, but he caught me, and he, like, force fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass. Then maybe Joey's right. Maybe the all good deeds are selfish. I will find a selfless good deed because I just gave birth to 3 children, and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right. Hey, Monica. Mhmm. Can I ask you a cooking question? Sure. If you're cooking on the stove, Does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard? Chandler? Is he? You know what? I I think I'm going to respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend. Why? I mean, if this guy was me, and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this. Alright, Emily. As much as I love you, in. I'm sorry. I can't move to London without Ben. I understand that would be difficult. Would you please Consider moving here. I mean, you were gonna move here anyway. Why can't you just do that? I don't know.

Alright? Did you just say alright? I did. Now I'm the idiot. Oh, Emily, that is that's so great. That it's gonna be so great. We're gonna be like like like 2 idiots in love.

Oh god, Monica. Tell me you're waiting for a guy.\n\nPlease tell me you're waiting for a guy. Guess guess I was. A guy from work. I'm seeing a guy from work. That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a nonthreatening Ray Liotta?\n\nUh-huh. That one. You know what? Just give me a second. I'll be out of your hair.\n\nI'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him. Okay. Okay.\n\nIt's just Joanne Ross. Why aren't you guys at the movie? Well, we were, but Ross was talking so loud on his phone. They threw us out. I had to talk loud because the movie was loud.\n\nHe's talking to London. Oh my god. Did he get in touch with Emily? Well, no. Not yet.\n\nHe's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her. I I don't care if I said some other girl's name, you prissy old twit. Ross, way to suck up to the family. I'm so glad you guys are all here. My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper.\n\nOh, hi. Is this nanny Hopkins? I'm I'm looking for Emily Waltham.

A little, good deed for PBS plus some TV exposure. Now that's the kind of math Joey likes To do. Ugh. PBS.\n\nWhat's wrong with PBS? What's right with them? Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs? Right. Because right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, you know, personally.\n\nSo I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street because they were so nice when I was a little kid. No one ever wrote back. Well, you know, a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs. All I got was a lousy key chain. And by that time, I was living in a box.\n\nI didn't have keys. I'm sorry, Pheebs. I just, You know, I just wanted to do a good deed like like you did with the babies. This isn't a good deed. You just wanna get on TV.\n\nThis is totally selfish. Woah. Woah. Woah. What about you having those babies for your brother?\n\nTalk about self. What what are you talking about? Well, yeah. It was a really nice thing and all, but it It made you feel really good. Right?\n\nYeah. So? Well, it made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look. There's no unselfish good deed.\n\nSorry. Yes. There are. There are totally good deeds that are selfless. Well, may I ask for one example?\n\nYeah. It's you know, there's No. You may not. That's because all people are selfish. Are you calling me selfish?\n\nAre you calling you people? Yeah. Well, sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you know the deal on Santa Claus.\n\nRight? I'm gonna find a selfless good deed. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius. Hello? Hello, Ross?\n\nEmily? Emma? Oh my god. Oh my god. It's Emily.\n\nIt's Emily. Everyone. In. Hi. Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives.\n\nGoodbye. No. Wait. Wait. Look.\n\nOkay. Okay. You can hang up, but I I'm gonna keep calling. I'm gonna I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me. Really?\n\nAbout what? Look. You're you're my Wife, we're we're married. You know? I I love you.\n\nI I really miss you. I miss you too. Well, at least I think I do. She's talking. Hey, Joey.\n\nWhen you said the deal was Santa Claus, you meant That he doesn't exist. Right. So, Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend? Yeah. She, she, He, should I have mentioned it?\n\nSo, man, when are we gonna meet this, new secret waiter man? Uh-huh. He's really shy. I I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet. Yeah.\n\nI don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet. I don't care. I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had. Really? That's what you heard?\n\nYou said that? I might have said that. Why is that funny? Because I'm very happy for him. And you, you lucky dog.\n\nHey. Hey. Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship. That's great. In London.\n\nHey. What? She wants me to move to London. But you live here. You know that.\n\nWhat what what are you gonna do? I don't know. I mean, I can't leave Ben. Well, you could just video conference with him. I'm not ready to have a child.\n\nI bet if I Talk to Carol and Susan. I could convince them to move to London with Ben. Yeah. I'm sure your ex wife would be more than happy to move to another country so You can patch things up with your new wife. What could happen?\n\nRoss, we are We're not moving to London. We already have lives here. Yeah. But but, yeah, but it'd be great. They they have great theater, great accents, Tea?\n\nThey have a queen. So? She's she's a woman. In. Hey.\n\nHey. Hey. Guess what? We're moving to London. Yes.\n\nWho's going to London? Nobody's going to London. Oh, welcome to London, governor. Right. Right.\n\nHey. It'll be great because we'll have big Ben and little Ben in the same city. Woo hoo. Hey. Go pack.\n\nHey. See? See? He wants to go. Yeah.\n\nWe leave all our big decisions to the 3 year old. Come on. Come on. It it'll be just like, 3's Company, only only there's a kid and my wife, and and you aren't the gay one. How you doing?\n\nWelcome. Good to see you. This will be your phone. That's great, but, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls. No.\n\nYou answer it and take pledges. But I'm the host. No. Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phone.\n\nYou don't seem to understand. See, I was doctor Drake Ramores. Well, here's your phone, doctor. I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed. You know that really old guy that lives next door to me?\n\nWell, I snuck over there and and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop, but he caught me, and he, like, force fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass. Then maybe Joey's right. Maybe the all good deeds are selfish.\n\nI will find a selfless good deed because I just gave birth to 3 children, and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right. Hey, Monica. Mhmm. Can I ask you a cooking question? Sure.\n\nIf you're cooking on the stove, Does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard? Chandler? Is he? You know what? I I think I'm going to respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.\n\nWhy? I mean, if this guy was me, and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this. Alright, Emily. As much as I love you, in. I'm sorry.\n\nI can't move to London without Ben. I understand that would be difficult. Would you please Consider moving here. I mean, you were gonna move here anyway. Why can't you just do that?\n\nI don't know. It's just Oh, okay. Okay. But but I know that even though I've been a a complete idiot up till now I mean, I mean, you you have to come here. You have to so we can work this out together.\n\nAlright. Alright? Did you just say alright? I did. Now I'm the idiot.\n\nOh, Emily, that is that's so great. That it's gonna be so great. We're gonna be like like like 2 idiots in love. Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still. Yes.\n\nTell me. Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me upon that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends. I know. I am I am so sorry.
