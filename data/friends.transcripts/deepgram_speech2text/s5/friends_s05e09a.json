Oh. Oh. Oh.\n\nSymbolism. And, the the, wildness of the Moors, which I think is is mirrored In the wildness of, Heathcliff's character. Excellent. What Rachel has truly observed here. You completely missed on my answer.\n\nI thought that was pretty obvious. Well, how would you know? You didn't even read it. What do you think, the you and the blue shirt?
