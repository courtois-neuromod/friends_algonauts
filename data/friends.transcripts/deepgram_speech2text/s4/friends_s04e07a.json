It was like torture. You know, if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise. It just keeps getting worse and worse. Know? I mean, it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommate's girlfriend, which by the way, I think she knows because every time we're in the same room together, there's this weird, like, energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean, at least when I'd seen her with clothes on, I could imagine that her body was, like, covered in boils or something. But there are no boils. She's smooth. Smooth. Wow. Did everyone totally see up his robe? Oh, yeah. There you go. Great. Alright. So I'll call you later. Great. Hey. Hey. Hey. Who is that? That would be Casey. We're going out tonight. Going out, Wow. Wow. So things didn't work out with Kathy. Bummer. No. Things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, but after my early dinner With Casey. What? Yeah. Yeah. And the craziest thing is I just ate a whole pizza myself. Wait. You're going out with Kathy. Yeah. Why are you getting so upset? Well, I'm upset for you. Well, I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. But what is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive. Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey I mean, granted, I just saw the back of her head. I got this sense that she's she's smart and funny and gets you. You got all that from the back of her head? Alright. Look. I just think it's time for you to settle down. You know? Make a choice. Pick Elaine. Who's They're swinging with the greatest of these. Darn it. I don't know how to get to the next verse. Oh, you can just go, greatest of these, and then go right into it. Yeah. Oh, I like that. Yeah. Wait. How do you know about? You know, I used to play. Oh, yeah. That's right. The keyboards. Yeah. I mean, just a little in high school, but then I I really got into it in college. I mean, that's that's when I really found my sound. Oh god. Art just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my god. I completely forgot about your sound. Yeah. He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was ever allowed to hear the sound. I wanna hear the sound. No. I mean no. I haven't played in so long, and and, Well, it's it's really personal stuff. You know? Come on. Play that funky music, white boy. Yeah. Oh, you guys? I mean, my keyboards are all the way up the no. Yeah. Okay. So who wants to get some dinner with me later? I really wanna try that new Italian restaurant. Supposed to be really good. Saw a lot of Chinese people eating in there. What are you talking about? Remember you said some restaurant must be really good because you saw all these Chinese people eating in there? That's because it was a Chinese restaurant. Oh, well, I saw why go. Who wants to come? Oh, I can't. I got 2 dinner dates tonight, so I gotta get laid. Alright. Girls' night out. Oh, sorry, honey, but we gotta prep that catering thing we have for tomorrow. Oh, that's right. I wish I was one of those people who could eat in restaurants alone. You should try it. It's a really good thing to do. Yes. I think I would feel really self Punches. You know? Like, I was on display or something. No. I was on display once. Nothing like eating alone.

No. Just fun. Fun. Good. Fun. Yeah. See, I told you to have fun. No. Although I must say that I totally judge any woman I see eating alone. Why? Excuse me. What is wrong with the woman eating alone?

It was like torture. You know, if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise. It just keeps getting worse and worse. Know?\n\nI mean, it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommate's girlfriend, which by the way, I think she knows because every time we're in the same room together, there's this weird, like, energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean, at least when I'd seen her with clothes on, I could imagine that her body was, like, covered in boils or something. But there are no boils.\n\nShe's smooth. Smooth. Wow. Did everyone totally see up his robe? Oh, yeah.\n\nThere you go. Great. Alright. So I'll call you later. Great.\n\nHey. Hey. Hey. Who is that? That would be Casey.\n\nWe're going out tonight. Going out, Wow. Wow. So things didn't work out with Kathy. Bummer.\n\nNo. Things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, but after my early dinner With Casey. What? Yeah.\n\nYeah. And the craziest thing is I just ate a whole pizza myself. Wait. You're going out with Kathy. Yeah.\n\nWhy are you getting so upset? Well, I'm upset for you. Well, I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. But what is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.\n\nLook, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey I mean, granted, I just saw the back of her head. I got this sense that she's she's smart and funny and gets you. You got all that from the back of her head? Alright.\n\nLook. I just think it's time for you to settle down. You know? Make a choice. Pick Elaine.\n\nWho's They're swinging with the greatest of these. Darn it. I don't know how to get to the next verse. Oh, you can just go, greatest of these, and then go right into it. Yeah.\n\nOh, I like that. Yeah. Wait. How do you know about? You know, I used to play.\n\nOh, yeah. That's right. The keyboards. Yeah. I mean, just a little in high school, but then I I really got into it in college.\n\nI mean, that's that's when I really found my sound. Oh god. Art just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my god. I completely forgot about your sound.\n\nYeah. He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was ever allowed to hear the sound. I wanna hear the sound. No.\n\nI mean no. I haven't played in so long, and and, Well, it's it's really personal stuff. You know? Come on. Play that funky music, white boy.\n\nYeah. Oh, you guys? I mean, my keyboards are all the way up the no. Yeah. Okay.\n\nSo who wants to get some dinner with me later? I really wanna try that new Italian restaurant. Supposed to be really good. Saw a lot of Chinese people eating in there. What are you talking about?\n\nRemember you said some restaurant must be really good because you saw all these Chinese people eating in there? That's because it was a Chinese restaurant. Oh, well, I saw why go. Who wants to come? Oh, I can't.\n\nI got 2 dinner dates tonight, so I gotta get laid. Alright. Girls' night out. Oh, sorry, honey, but we gotta prep that catering thing we have for tomorrow. Oh, that's right.\n\nI wish I was one of those people who could eat in restaurants alone. You should try it. It's a really good thing to do. Yes. I think I would feel really self Punches.\n\nYou know? Like, I was on display or something. No. I was on display once. Nothing like eating alone.\n\nI just had a great time with my Self. Well, this could be a good story. At dinner So liberating. You know? I don't need people to have fun.\n\nI'm fun. I'm a fun girl. Are you a naughty girl? No. Just fun.\n\nFun. Good. Fun. Yeah. See, I told you to have fun.\n\nNo. Although I must say that I totally judge any woman I see eating alone. Why? Excuse me. What is wrong with the woman eating alone?\n\nWell, obviously, something. She's eating alone. Okay, guys. Alright. Bring it on, you.\n\nHere we go. You know, I've I've never played my stuff for anyone before, So it's important that that you understand it's about communicating very private Emotions. You know, you should you should think of, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm my god. Play.\n\nWell, that that was, Terrific. Really bitching. Wow. It was so wow. Really?\n\nI mean, really? Yeah. I mean, you should play in public. Oh, thanks, you guys. That's, oh, I wanna I wanna play you another piece.\n\nOh, I left my, helicopter sounds on another disc. I'll be right back. Okay? This is so nice. I mean, I'm I am so God bless my dad for soundproofing the basement.\n\nOh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers. What are you guys talking about? I loved it. It was so moving. Oh, plus, it's just it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.\n\nYou mean music? Yeah. I know what you're thinking. Yes. Yes.\n\nYour breasts are just as Furman juice. Come here. Hey. Oh god. Is that Baywatch?\n\nYes. But, I just watch it for the articles. So is Joey around? No. No.\n\nHe's not back yet, but he's gonna be here any So, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern? I don't really have a preference. You?\n\nI like it in the stern. Of the boat. Hello. Hey. It's me.\n\nListen. Casey and I were on our way back, and we held on a car truck. What happened? We broke down on the parkway. So I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid.\n\nAnyway, listen. Could you please tell Kathy that I'm sorry, and I'll be there as soon as I can? Why can't you tell her? Because I only had 1 quarter, and I think my time is about to Joey? Joey?\n\nYeah. I thought your time ran Me too. But I guess I do have a couple of more that was Joey. He's running a little late, and he says he's sorry. Oh.\n\nSo I guess it's just, you and me then. Oh, okay. Yeah. I think it is. So what'd you do today?\n\nOh, I had an appointment to get my haircut. Oh, it looks great. And then it got canceled. Well, I could cut it. Really?\n\nDo you do that? Yeah. I do. Oh, of course, I learned it at my aunt's dog grooming shop, but, hey.
