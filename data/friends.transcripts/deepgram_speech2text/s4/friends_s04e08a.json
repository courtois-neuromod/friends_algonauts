It's the spirit of Thanksgiving. Are things with you and Joey any better? They couldn't be worse. I spent 8 hours calling him last night just trying to get him to talk to me. Oh, wow. 8 hours. So you could probably really use one of those plug in telephone headsets. Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office? As You shouldn't. Speaking of Christmas, since Monica and I are Starting a new business and have, like, no money. This year, maybe we could do Secret Santa, and then we each only buy 1 gift. And and There's the added mystery of, you know, who gets who. Who gets whom? With you. I don't know why I do that, but it is correct. Hey. What's this? It's all your names. Let's pick. Hey.

He works in a museum. Hey. What time is it? The big game's about to start. You don't have to do that. Ross and Joey aren't here. You can watch The parade if you want. Thanks. What is wrong with this freezer? As you can. What happened? My god. Ice just got in my eye. People are trying to sleep in here. Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts. Open it up. Let me see.

Alright. I I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question. I'm gonna be in there. While I'm gone, Chandler, you're in charge. With you. So listen. I picked Monica for Secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Hanukkah. I was wondering if you wanna switch. Oh, you know what? I was trying to trade for, well, you. Really? Wow. That's That's so nice. Well, what are you gonna get me? I don't know, RG. I was thinking something girly for your office. Yeah. Well, maybe, Phoebe will switch with me. Oh, no.

Sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt. Everything? Even the TV? No. I'm gonna put that in my room. Listen, Joey. I know what he did was wrong, but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out? Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out? That's a good point. So, how long are you to punish him? 5 years. You've sentenced him? Hey. Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. Joey, the guy's your best friend. Oh, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open. Who? Me? Yeah. Wow. I'm honored. You know what I'm gonna do is my 1st act as your best friend, I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler. Alright. But if you weren't my best friend Oh my god. Is it really that bad? I walk in a room, and he won't even talk to me. He just mumbles something in Italian. With you. And I know he only knows the bad words. I'm so so as Sorry. I feel responsible. It's not your fault. Hey, Gunther. Have you, have you seen Chandler? I thought you were Chandler. But, What if he's over there? With Oh. Hey, Joe. I'll be right with you. Okay? Thanks for coming in. Oh my god.

Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her? It's not about her. Okay? But seeing you 2 together just Reminds me of what you did, and I don't wanna live with someone who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So let's see. Hey. Look. I know with What it is to be a friend. I just I screwed up. Yeah. You did, and that's why I'm leaving. With Alright. Look. If you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them. Okay?

Yeah. But But if I didn't know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much. See you around. Alright. Wait. Come on. Wait. Just wait one second. There has to be something that I can do. Something. If we still had that entertainment unit, I would get in there for 6 hours and think about how I let you down. We got a box. I remember the last time I saw you. It was the morning I left for college, And you were just standing outside the Dairy Queen. I was probably waiting for it to open. Gotta tell you, you look great now. You look great too. You're an excellent patient. So how does it look? Well, you've got a little scratch on your cornea. You're gonna Have to wear a patch for a couple of days. Like a pirate? That helps you. So how long have you been working with your dad? Come on. 1 of us had to mention him. Okay.

Hey. It's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All Hello?\n\nLook. I never should've kissed your girlfriend, and I'm Stop calling. Alright. What is the name of? Your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything.\n\nAnymore. Damn it, Taylor. Stop calling. Joe Joey. It's Ross.\n\nOh, sorry, man. It's alright. What's up? Not much. I got, I got Chandler here, and he's really, really Turkey.\n\nUgh. Giving thanks. Ugh. Look, everyone. It's the spirit of Thanksgiving.\n\nAre things with you and Joey any better? They couldn't be worse. I spent 8 hours calling him last night just trying to get him to talk to me. Oh, wow. 8 hours.\n\nSo you could probably really use one of those plug in telephone headsets. Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office? As You shouldn't. Speaking of Christmas, since Monica and I are Starting a new business and have, like, no money. This year, maybe we could do Secret Santa, and then we each only buy 1 gift.\n\nAnd and There's the added mystery of, you know, who gets who. Who gets whom? With you. I don't know why I do that, but it is correct. Hey.\n\nWhat's this? It's all your names. Let's pick. Hey. What's going?\n\nNo, Joey. Stay away from me. Joey, come on. We're picking names for Secret Santa. K.\n\nI invented secret sanding, you know. What are you laughing at? You're You're the one who said Die Hard was your idea. It was. Don't make me show you the napkin.\n\nAgain. Oh, I'm gonna take a nap. Turkey makes me sleepy. We haven't eaten yet. I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready and us with Hey.\n\nBy any chance, either of you pick, Rachel for your secret Santa? Because I wanna trade for I kicked her. Oh, thank god. You want her. Oh.\n\nWow. Why do you wanna get rid of her so badly? Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets. It's It's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on.\n\nLet's train. Well, that's not true. That's not true. I got her that backpack, and she loved it. I remember how much he was crying the day that big dog ran off with well, there was no big dog.\n\nAlright. This sucks because because I already got her this briefcase, and I had RG put on it. Her initials. Okay. I'm really bad at initials.\n\nAs you. I thought you had your shopping done early this year. Yeah. Well, my camel cash was about to expire. So Maybe you can give it to somebody else.\n\nWith Oh, like Ross Geller. You know what, though? It's kind of a, girly briefcase. Who cares? He works in a museum.\n\nHey. What time is it? The big game's about to start. You don't have to do that. Ross and Joey aren't here.\n\nYou can watch The parade if you want. Thanks. What is wrong with this freezer? As you can. What happened?\n\nMy god. Ice just got in my eye. People are trying to sleep in here. Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts. Open it up.\n\nLet me see. Oh, you know what? I can't. It really kills. Well, maybe you should put some ice on it.\n\nOh, it looks with the doctor. Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor. No. My eye doctor is Richard. I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend.\n\nHe's really picky about his patients. With Okay. You've gotta go. What's his office number? Like, I remember his office number.\n\nSpeed dial 7. Hi. Yeah. I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye. And is, is Richard Burke in today?\n\nHe's out of town, but does she wanna see the on call doctor? As you Yes. Yes. She's very excited about that. Okay.\n\nWe'll be right in. Okay. So, who's gonna who's gonna take her in? I'll go. You can watch your Right.\n\nSo cool. So Monica gets back. It's like, I'm head chef, with Then I get to make all the decisions. Hey. Hey.\n\nI thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly. Okay. Get out of my kitchen. Alright. Okay.\n\nI think I am making some progress with Joey. When I went into the apartment, he went straight into his bedroom, but he only slammed the door once. I mean, yeah. He gave me the finger while doing it. Alright.\n\nI I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question. I'm gonna be in there. While I'm gone, Chandler, you're in charge. With you. So listen.\n\nI picked Monica for Secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Hanukkah. I was wondering if you wanna switch. Oh, you know what? I was trying to trade for, well, you. Really?\n\nWow. That's That's so nice. Well, what are you gonna get me? I don't know, RG. I was thinking something girly for your office.\n\nYeah. Well, maybe, Phoebe will switch with me. Oh, no. No. No.\n\nYou don't wanna do that. Then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel, and she exchanges every gift she ever gets. As me. That's not true. I got her lots of stuff she never took back.\n\nLike? Like that, gold necklace I got her last year. And when was the last time you saw her wear it? Well, she wore it all Christmas Day, and then, big dog. Now.\n\nHey. Hey. What are you doing? Sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt. Everything?\n\nEven the TV? No. I'm gonna put that in my room. Listen, Joey. I know what he did was wrong, but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?\n\nBack when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out? That's a good point. So, how long are you to punish him? 5 years. You've sentenced him?\n\nHey. Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. Joey, the guy's your best friend. Oh, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard.\n\nWith him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open. Who? Me? Yeah. Wow.\n\nI'm honored. You know what I'm gonna do is my 1st act as your best friend, I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler. Alright. But if you weren't my best friend Oh my god. Is it really that bad?\n\nI walk in a room, and he won't even talk to me. He just mumbles something in Italian. With you. And I know he only knows the bad words. I'm so so as Sorry.\n\nI feel responsible. It's not your fault. Hey, Gunther. Have you, have you seen Chandler? I thought you were Chandler.\n\nBut, What if he's over there? With Oh. Hey, Joe. I'll be right with you. Okay?\n\nThanks for coming in. Oh my god. How cute is the on call doctor? No. So cute that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.\n\nYou have best luck with eye doctors. As I know. Doctor Burke will see you now. Oh, no. No.\n\nNo. Not doctor Burke. Doc doctor Burke's out of town. The the on call doctor will see me now. Doctor Richard Burke is out of town.\n\nDoctor Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now. Ready? Hey. I'm sorry. That Where are you going?\n\nMy folks. Oh, when you when you coming back? I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment. What?\n\nYeah. You know, at first, I thought we could talk about this, you know, work it out, but, Seeing you 2 together, I don't Hey. Look. What do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?\n\nIt's not about her. Okay? But seeing you 2 together just Reminds me of what you did, and I don't wanna live with someone who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So let's see. Hey.\n\nLook. I know with What it is to be a friend. I just I screwed up. Yeah. You did, and that's why I'm leaving.\n\nWith Alright. Look. If you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them. Okay? They have had a very difficult a year, what with the robbery and all.\n\nThat chick used to be very cute. When that guy was robbing us when I was locked in the entertainment unit for, like, 6 hours, as Do you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down. Wow. Yeah.\n\nBut But if I didn't know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much. See you around. Alright. Wait. Come on.\n\nWait. Just wait one second. There has to be something that I can do. Something. If we still had that entertainment unit, I would get in there for 6 hours and think about how I let you down.\n\nWe got a box. I remember the last time I saw you. It was the morning I left for college, And you were just standing outside the Dairy Queen. I was probably waiting for it to open. Gotta tell you, you look great now.\n\nYou look great too. You're an excellent patient. So how does it look? Well, you've got a little scratch on your cornea. You're gonna Have to wear a patch for a couple of days.\n\nLike a pirate? That helps you. So how long have you been working with your dad? Come on. 1 of us had to mention him.\n\nOkay.
