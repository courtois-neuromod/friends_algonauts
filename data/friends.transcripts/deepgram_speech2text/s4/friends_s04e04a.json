Oh, oh, I'm sorry. It's a little old, but You're clogging up the chute. I just spent a half hour unclogging.\n\nI'm sorry. I didn't I don't coming here a lot. Yeah. Of course, you don't. No.\n\nBecause you're a little princess. Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of cats say happy birthday to me. Boy, you think you can just come in here, Make a mess of big man in the coveralls, or come and clean it up.\n\nWell, why don't you think of someone else for a change? It's okay. I'm sorry. God. You're gonna cry about it.\n\nWoah. Woah. Trigger made you crying? Yes. And you said really mean things that were only partly true.\n\nI'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson. Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best if we just forget about it. That's easy for you to say. You weren't almost just killed.\n\nAlright. That's it. School is in session. God. Is this a gym card?\n\nOh, yeah. Gym member. I'm trying to go 4 times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times. So why don't you quit? You don't think I've tried?\n\nYou think I like having $50 taken out of my bank account every month? No. They make you go all the way down there, then they use all these phrases and peppiness to try to confuse you. And then they bring out Maria. Who is Maria?\n\nOh, Maria. You can't say no to her. She's like this Lycra spandex covered gym treat. Do you need me to go down there with you and hold your hand? No.\n\nAlright. So you're strong enough to face her alone? Oh, no. You'll have to come.

Maybe you haven't heard of a little something called not making girls cry. Yeah. Well, maybe you haven't heard a little something called the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968.\n\nI have actually not heard of that. Yeah. Well, your friends are in violation of it. I've been a nice guy up until now, but, I don't need this grief. I'm gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally sublet their grandmother's apartment.\n\nYour friends are out of here, pal. Don't you tell me something I don't know. Please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today. What's the matter?

No.\n\nI can handle it. No. I'm a professional. Oh, fibs. Is that a new ankle bracelet?\n\nWell, and you got a pedicure. Your feet are all dressed up. Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table. You're gonna do some feet flirting. I don't know what you're talking about.\n\nThen how do you explain the toe ring? Because it's Arabian It says stay at work. Okay? Leave me alone. Oh, my hero.\n\nWhat happened? Well, I went down there, and I told him no one treats my friends like that, and he better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later. Wait a minute. What'd he say?\n\nHe said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally. So instead, what he's gonna do is have you evicted. I'll see you later. Don't you don't get it, Zalubnick. I told you not to go down there.\n\nBut he made Rachel cry. Rachel always cries. That's not true. You go down there and you suck up to him. I mean, you suck like you've never sucked before.\n\nAlright. I'll try. But if I can't, you stay with Chandler and I till he gets settled. Go. Alright.\n\nAlright. Alright. I mean, I'll have to check with him first, but I think he'll be cool. Woah. Woah.\n\nWoah. Woah. Hey. Now remember what we talked about. You gotta be strong.\n\nYes. Yes. One more time. Hey.

It's been killing me today. You mean the k.\n\nBy sciatic, you mean the towel covered portion? Yeah. Sure. Yeah. No.\n\nI can do that. Yeah. Because, you know, usually the muscles in the sciatic area can get, you know, real nice And tight. Yeah. So, tell me, Rick, How, how'd you injured the area?\n\nA 16 hour sit in for Greenpeace. Oh. Ow. Did you just bite me? No.\n\nWhat? Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out. This wasn't their fault. It was mine. You want me to kick you guys out instead?\n\nNo. You can't do that. Where would the chick and the duck live? You have pets? No.\n\nNo. No. No. Those are, nicknames. Yeah.\n\nI'm the chick, and Chandler's the duck. I would've thought it was the other way around.
