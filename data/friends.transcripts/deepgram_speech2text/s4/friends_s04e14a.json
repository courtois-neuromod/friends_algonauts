I I I think you look great. Good night. It was very nice to meet you all. Okay.\n\nPlease hurry. Okay. Don't I just love the way they talk? Oh, what? It kicked.\n\nI think the baby kicked. Oh my god.

No.\n\nShe was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. I can't believe this. All I wanted was just a few hours outside of work to see Joshua so that he could go ahead and start falling in love with me. Aw, Faves. Honey, that's your name.\n\nThat's short for Phoebe? I thought that's just what we called each other. Hey. You're wearing pants. That's right.\n\nWe're the guys. I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers. It's 9:30 in the morning. Can I get a breakfast buffet? Hello?\n\nOh, hey, Ross. Oh, let me talk to her. Oh my god. Well, can I just Shh? Wait.\n\nWhat? She's shushing me. It's my phone, and she's shushing. Please.
