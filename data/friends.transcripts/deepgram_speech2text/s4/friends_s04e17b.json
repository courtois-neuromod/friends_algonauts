Good one. It is not over because she's going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't is because her feelings were so strong that it scared her. And you go home and you wait for her calls. She could be calling you from the plane. Come on. Now go. Go. Okay. Okay. But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over. No. Wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, you know, to to see what's going on. And and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't, Then it's over. Way to be strong, man. Hi. Alright. Listen. Can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last 2 hours watching In N Out and In Again. So why don't you just turn it off? Because then we'd be the guys who turned off free porn. Yeah. But That's not like what you'd go by. Ritch, look. I wanna have a kid someday. Okay? And someday, that kid is gonna ask me if I ever turned off free porn. I don't wanna have to tell him that I did. Did you ever ask your dad that? I don't wanna talk about it. Oh, good. You're here. Okay. Hi. Hi. Well, what'd you got here? Oh, this? Well, I'm glad you asked. Now don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin Canned with an ordinary steak knife. Now I know what you're thinking.

Ross, there's something that I've I've got to tell you. There's there's someone else. Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America? She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy. So I told her when she figures it out, give me a call. Maybe I'll still be around. Okay. Just so I know, when you say Still around? Do you mean still around like you might be in a relationship or still around like you might have died waiting for the phone to ring? Oh, Oh, but it was so right. This isn't how it was supposed to go. I mean, there can't be another guy. Well, Of course, there's another guy. This is even more perfect. Now you have to prove your love. I'm not proving anything. Okay? I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the 1st place, I never would put my fist through the wall. You put your fist through the wall? No. I missed and hit the door, but it opened really hard. You have to go to London. What? Yeah. You have to go fight for her. Oh, yeah. Sure. That makes sense. Yeah. Because you already told her you loved her, and she didn't say it back. Then she called you and told you there was another guy. So, yeah, go to London. That'll scare her. When Rachel was with Paolo, what did you do? I made fun of his accent. You sat back and let him have her. You You didn't fight at all. Am I right? I just told you. I made fun of him behind his back. I see. You want the same thing to Happen with Emily? No. Alright then. Go fight for her. Woah. Yeah. It's like a snake pit. I mean, that could be you and Emily. That, but but nicer. Just go to London. Really? Come on. Surprise her. Show him at her doorstep. Don't let her go without a fight. Alright. Alright. I'm gonna do it. Alright. I'm gonna I'm gonna go to London, and I am gonna fight for her. Okay. Good luck. Ross. Ross. If you're going to the airport, can you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars? Oh, oh, I did it. I did it. I figured out way to make money. I'm gonna open up my own massage place, and Frank's gonna help me. And we can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school. That sounds great, but how are you gonna be able to afford it? Well, we were walking down the street, and we saw that van that you guys used Catering, and we realized But I'm telling, and I'm telling it. Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages To relax, so I just figured we could combine the 2. Okay. I give the massages, and Frank drives. I can fix up the van, bolt a table in the back, and you know what I've got? A place that no one will ever get out of alive? No. Think about it. It's a taxi that people take when they need to relax. Relaxy taxi. The name was my favorite part. Well well, I came up with it. You did not. No. You came up with relaxing cab. Well, that's not good. Hello. Hey. Oh my god. Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised? No. Because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night. She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm a stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her place. What was that? So I just I just put my fist through another wall. Tell the guys. Alright. When is when is the next flight out? About 4 hours. Okay. Just stay there a couple more hours, and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home. Oh, because I just remembered, there's a girl at the restaurant that would be perfect for you. Tell him about relaxi taxi, and I'd ask him if he thinks that's better than relaxi cab. It's not relaxi cab. It's relaxi cab like taxi cab. Oh, that is better. Do you have any eights? Nope. Are we in London? What are you doing here? You can't be here. I've, I've come to talk to Rot. What? Nothing. No. Enough. I was gonna call him, but You came to tell him you love him. I knew it. I was right. I'm right. Right? I'd really rather talk to him. I've been to his apartment, and he's not there. And, I need to talk to him. So do you have any idea where he is? Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this, but I'm gonna talk anyway. I'm in the States with your sister and your friends, and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that and to tell Yes, Joey. You can have all the chocolate you want. Just take it. I came here To tell you that I love you. I love you too. I'm I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth. You can't hear me. I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that. I suppose I've just either told you that I love you or I've given my neighbors a good laugh. Missus Newman, if you're listening, bugger off. This is none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did hear that, and There's the call waiting, so I should go. Oh, well. Hello? Hi. Ross, I love you. Thank you. Hi. Hey. I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault. Same kinda thing happened to me.

Okay.\n\nGood one. It is not over because she's going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't is because her feelings were so strong that it scared her.

Okay.\n\nYou know how people need transportation, but they also need massages To relax, so I just figured we could combine the 2. Okay. I give the massages, and Frank drives. I can fix up the van, bolt a table in the back, and you know what I've got? A place that no one will ever get out of alive?\n\nNo. Think about it. It's a taxi that people take when they need to relax. Relaxy taxi. The name was my favorite part.\n\nWell well, I came up with it. You did not. No. You came up with relaxing cab. Well, that's not good.\n\nHello. Hey. Oh my god. Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?\n\nNo. Because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night. She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm a stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her place. What was that?\n\nSo I just I just put my fist through another wall. Tell the guys. Alright. When is when is the next flight out? About 4 hours.\n\nOkay. Just stay there a couple more hours, and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home. Oh, because I just remembered, there's a girl at the restaurant that would be perfect for you. Tell him about relaxi taxi, and I'd ask him if he thinks that's better than relaxi cab. It's not relaxi cab.\n\nIt's relaxi cab like taxi cab. Oh, that is better. Do you have any eights? Nope. Are we in London?\n\nWhat are you doing here? You can't be here. I've, I've come to talk to Rot. What? Nothing.\n\nNo. Enough. I was gonna call him, but You came to tell him you love him. I knew it. I was right.\n\nI'm right. Right? I'd really rather talk to him. I've been to his apartment, and he's not there. And, I need to talk to him.\n\nSo do you have any idea where he is? Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this, but I'm gonna talk anyway. I'm in the States with your sister and your friends, and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that and to tell Yes, Joey.\n\nYou can have all the chocolate you want. Just take it. I came here To tell you that I love you. I love you too. I'm I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth.\n\nYou can't hear me. I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that. I suppose I've just either told you that I love you or I've given my neighbors a good laugh. Missus Newman, if you're listening, bugger off. This is none of your business.\n\nI suppose there's not much chance you did hear that, and There's the call waiting, so I should go. Oh, well. Hello? Hi. Ross, I love you.\n\nThank you. Hi. Hey. I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault. Same kinda thing happened to me.\n\nWoman pizza delivery guy comes over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, And leaves. What? No, like, nice apartment, but the bedrooms are huge? Nothing. You know what?\n\nWe have to turn off the porn. I think you're right. What do you like? Alright. Ready?\n\n1, 2, 3, 1. That's kinda nice. Yeah. It's kind of a relief. You wanna see if we still have it?\n\nYeah. There's 1, 23. Oh my god. Oh, that's so beautiful. I can't believe it.\n\nI know. I like the middle one the best. Don't worry. I won't let the other 2", "paragraphs": [{"sentences": [{"text": "What do I do now?", "start": 2.6399999, "end": 4.02}, {"text": "You play hard to get.", "start": 4.24, "end": 5.62}, {"text": "She
