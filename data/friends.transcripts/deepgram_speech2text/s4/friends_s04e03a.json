I just told my mom I'd cater a party for her. Come? Because I need the money, and I thought it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little smidgen of self respect. Come on. I think this is a good thing. I don't think mom would have hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do. You don't have to stick up for her. She can't hear you. Hey. Do you guys have any juice? Just pickle. Hey, Rach. Funny story. I bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday. My boss, Joanna? Wow. That must have been awkward. Well, no.

Why did you hire me? Oh, well, Richard raved about the food at his party. Of course, he was sleeping with him. Then I heard the food. The lesbian wedding is very nice. I assume you weren't sleeping with anyone there. So at least that would be something. Oh my god. Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good. Okay. I didn't hear that. Yeah. She didn't hire me out of pity. It wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends. She actually thinks I'm good. Wow. And, hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian. Good afternoon.

Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap, and some of it is not even popped. Could we be more white trash? How desperate am I?\n\nOh, good thing Chandler's not here. He always wins at this game. I just told my mom I'd cater a party for her. Come? Because I need the money, and I thought it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little smidgen of self respect.\n\nCome on. I think this is a good thing. I don't think mom would have hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do. You don't have to stick up for her. She can't hear you.\n\nHey. Do you guys have any juice? Just pickle. Hey, Rach. Funny story.\n\nI bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday. My boss, Joanna? Wow. That must have been awkward. Well, no.\n\nActually, she, asked me if I wanna get a drink. You, didn't say yes to that, did you? No. No. Hello, Rachel.\n\nWell, not at first. What is What's she doing here? I don't understand. Last time you went out with her, you said was a big doll dud. Well, I think I judged her too quickly.\n\nAnd this time, we were able to take the relationship to the next level. Well, last time, I almost got fired. You must end it. You must end it now. Oh, come on.\n\nIt's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me. I mean, usually, I'm pretty much just in there by myself. Taylor, promise. Rachel, aren't you running late? No.\n\nYou are if you're picking up a bagel. Okay. Chandler, promise you will end this now. Okay. I promise I'll end it.\n\nThank you. But I hope you know what I'm giving up for you because she's not just the boss in your office. You know what I mean? Oh, I'm Sorry. I I knew what he meant.\n\nHow's the hired help? Doing great. Kiesha's are coming along. What's this? Blue nail polish?\n\nYeah. Thought it was cute. It's what your grandmother's house looked like when we found her. Let let me ask you a question. Why did you hire me?\n\nOh, well, Richard raved about the food at his party. Of course, he was sleeping with him. Then I heard the food. The lesbian wedding is very nice. I assume you weren't sleeping with anyone there.\n\nSo at least that would be something. Oh my god. Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good. Okay.\n\nI didn't hear that. Yeah. She didn't hire me out of pity. It wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends. She actually thinks I'm good.\n\nWow. And, hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian. Good afternoon. Are you the decision maker of the house? Do you, currently own a set of encyclopedias?\n\nNo. No. But, try the classifieds. People sell everything in there. Actually, I'm not buying.\n\nI'm selling. Let me ask you 1 question.

I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my mom wouldn't give me grief about fighting them. Oh, no. I mean, it's weird that you only have 9 now.\n\nOh my god. Wait a minute. I had it when I put Oh my god. It's in the quiche. Oh my god.\n\nOkay. Don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store. I'm gonna get you another set of nails. No one's gonna know, and you're gonna look Oh.\n\nOh, it's because they're gonna eat. That's the problem. Honey, don't bite your nails. Okay. Please don't freak out.\n\nBut, there's a blue fingernail in in one of the quiche cups, And there's no way to know which one. And whoever finds it wins the prize. I'm not freaking out. Why are you laughing? It's nothing.\n\nIt's just that now your father owes me $5. What? You bet I'd lose a nail? Oh, no. Don't be silly.\n\nI just bet that I made these. Frozen lasagnas? You bet that I'd screw up? It's all that stuff about hiring me because I was good with No. That was all true.\n\nThis was just in case you pulled Emonika. You promised doctor Weinberg you'd never use that phrase. Mommy, come on. Have a sense of humor. You're never able to laugh at yourself.\n\nThat's right. My mom doesn't have any faith in me. Oh, that's hilarious. I don't get it. No.\n\nI have faith. No. You have lasagnas. Oh, the are ready. I really don't think we should be doing this.\n\nOkay.

What are you doing? I'm getting dressed. Why?\n\nWhen I walk outside naked, people throw garbage at me. Wait. I wanna show you something. What is it? Just a little gag gift somebody gave me.\n\nPut your hands together. You're not the boss of me. Yeah. You are. Sassy.\n\nYou're, you're gonna leave me like this? Knowing you're here waiting for me, I think that's kind of exciting, don't you? Okay. But if you don't come back Oh, and there's pretty much nothing I can do about it. Oh, Hi.\n\nI brought you back a macaroon. Oh, great. I'll keep it in my butt with your nose. That's weird. She locked the door.\n\nYou know why? She's got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning. Okay. Swear, you won't tell, but when Mark left, he gave me a key to him in his office.\n\nYou wanna see the lid? Yeah. Hi. How are you? Hello, Joanna?\n\nThis office? I'm really sorry, but I may be a little while longer. How little? A couple hours. I feel awful.\n\nLook. This isn't funny. You get back here right now. No. I can't.\n\nWhy not? I'm in my boss's car. What? Tunnel. What?\n\nRachel, can I see you for a moment? Okay. Here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door.
