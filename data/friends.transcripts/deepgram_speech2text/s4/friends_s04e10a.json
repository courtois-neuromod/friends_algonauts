Hey. Hi. Sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything? Well, Joey's stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. 15? Your personal best. So where were you? Oh, on a date. Yeah. I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate. Oh. Yeah. And I made her. Museum. No. Answer his. Oh, yeah. It was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door so she'd Have to pass by me if she wanted to, like, switch cars. She was totally at my mercy. Were you so late because you were burying this woman? No. I'm getting back now because she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's, like, 2 and a half hours away. How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? K. That joke woulda killed in Albany. John, I did it. Yeah. A little stupid now, Hey. Look at this. They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight. That paper's 2 weeks old. Alright. Who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash? I really wanna take Kathy to this. I can't believe I missed it. Hey. You know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with. Hate being alone this time of year. Next thing you know, it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang. Before you know it, they're lighting the damn tree again. I want somebody. You know, I want a man. I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship. You know? Just like a fling would be great. Really? I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling. Well, let me tell you something. It's been a long time since I've been flung. Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas. You know what? There's some nice guys in my office. You want me to set you up? Yeah. Wait a minute. It's been a long time that I've been Single. How come you've never offered this before? Well, I have a girlfriend. I'm I'm happy. So I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy. Okay. No accountants. Oh, and no one from, like, legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs. Oops. Oh, and Ross was like, what? A lion tamer? Hey. Hey. What's going on, Lauren? Everybody at the restaurant still hates me. Is it because of the review you wrote or something new? It's the review. I thought thought I was making headway. Everyone was smiling at me all day, and then I get off work and find out that they wrote this On my chef's hat. Hey. Maybe they meant to ride quiet, bitch. Hey, honey. What's the matter? Fine. Just trying to be nice. I mean, I have not been picked on this much since I was in kindergarten, and They had to bring in someone from junior high to do the seesaw with me. Oh. I mean, They're trying to do everything they can to make me quit. And if there were any other job, I would, but this is something I've been waiting for my whole life. Oh, honey. Wait a minute. You're the boss. Yes. Why don't you just yell at them or fire them? I would love to, but I can't. But I just can't. You know I'm not good at confrontation. Hey. You know what you could do? I remember reading about this director. I think it was, Orson Welles, who at the beginning of a movie would hire somebody just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know who was boss. Hey. Come on. I'm not doing anything. Why don't you fire me? It's a good idea. Do you know how to waiter? Good enough to get fired. Alright. You're hired. Hey. Oh. That must be why I got fired last week. Does this Orson Welles guy direct Burger King commercials? Yes. I say, Drew, are you seeing anybody right now? Oh, I'm I'm not asking for me. I've you know, I'm not I'm not gay. I'm not asking you out. I'm I'm not gay. I didn't think you were gay. I do now. See, my friend my friend Rachel, she wants to be set up. You know, I just got out of a big relationship. I'm not looking for anything serious. Well, you know, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling. That might be alright with Rachel. Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah. Is this hot Rachel that you took to the Christmas Rachel? Oh, by the way, that is her full name. Oh, wow. I'm free for her. Wait a second. I didn't say I wasn't free. Hey, Chandler. Why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow? Mhmm. Hold on. You know, I just got a box of Cubans. Maybe I bring them by our office around, 5? Well, that's a little later than I, generally care to stay, but sure. Maybe before the game, we can enjoy some 8 year old small batch basil hadans. Oh, I don't know what that is, but, it's a pretty nice jack. Kinda like that tie too. Keep your pants on, man. Hey. You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you wanna hear it? Yeah. Of course. Okay. Happy Hanukkah, Monica. May your Christmas be snowy, Joey. That's great. Oh, yay. But, you know, Rachel doesn't rhyme with Dreidel. I know, but it's so hard. Nothing rhymes with your stupid name. Oh, what are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel, Mayo, jail, bail, cable, maple. All good. Thanks. Do you maybe have, like, a nickname that's easier to write? Oh. Did your dad used to call you pumpkin? Oh, yeah. Pumpkin. Yeah. But did he ever call you, like, Budolph? Hello, children. Hey. Hi. Have I got the 50 guys For you. Really? Oh, yeah. I just showed them this picture of you, and guys are throwing themselves at me. They're buying me drinks. They're giving me stuff. Next tonight?

Oh, I like swimmer's bodies. Oh, yes. And his father invented that magnetic strip on credit cards. Oh, I like credit cards. See? Not bad at this fixing up thing. So what does he do? He works in the fine foods division. Your company has a fine foods division? It's a big company. I don't if you I now wait a second. You make food and robots? No. The robots just work for them. Alright. I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that? Yeah, lady. I do. I got a problem with that. You want a problem, I'll give you a problem. What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me? You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you. See you later. Thanks. Oh, well, I should get going. I've I've got a date tonight. Oh, yeah? With who? Do you know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie? Yeah. Yeah? Not her. Yeah. This is someone else I met, and I I can't decide between the 2 of them. You know, the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a 2 hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right off town. You know? She's, well, she's she's just as pretty. I guess she's smart. She's not fun. She's no fun. Why do wanna date her at all? Well, I I wanna give her another chance. You know? She lives so close. And at the end of the date, the the other time, she She said something that was, if she was kidding, was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist. Hey. Hey. Hey, man. Hey. Oh, how was your 1st day working at the restaurant? Damn. Hey. Hey. Oh, what happened to your fancy chef jacket? They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm I'm gonna call a meeting. I'm gonna fire you tonight. You got it. Whoop. Whoop. What are you doing? Still a tiny bit on fire there. Oh, good job. Thanks. Listen. I think you got it. Chandler, you have the best taste in men. Well, like father likes them. Patrick and I had such a great time last night. I mean, I think this could maybe turn into something serious. Really? I I thought you weren't even looking for something serious. I thought you were looking for some kind of, fling. Well, you know, possibly. You didn't tell him that though. Right? No. You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?

Hey. Hi. Sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything?\n\nWell, Joey's stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. 15? Your personal best. So where were you? Oh, on a date.\n\nYeah. I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate. Oh. Yeah. And I made her.\n\nMuseum. No. Answer his. Oh, yeah. It was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door so she'd Have to pass by me if she wanted to, like, switch cars.\n\nShe was totally at my mercy. Were you so late because you were burying this woman? No. I'm getting back now because she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's, like, 2 and a half hours away.\n\nHow can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? K. That joke woulda killed in Albany. John, I did it. Yeah.\n\nA little stupid now, Hey. Look at this. They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight. That paper's 2 weeks old. Alright.\n\nWho keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash? I really wanna take Kathy to this. I can't believe I missed it. Hey. You know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with.\n\nHate being alone this time of year. Next thing you know, it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang. Before you know it, they're lighting the damn tree again. I want somebody. You know, I want a man.\n\nI mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship. You know? Just like a fling would be great. Really? I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.\n\nWell, let me tell you something. It's been a long time since I've been flung. Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas. You know what? There's some nice guys in my office.\n\nYou want me to set you up? Yeah. Wait a minute. It's been a long time that I've been Single. How come you've never offered this before?\n\nWell, I have a girlfriend. I'm I'm happy. So I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy. Okay. No accountants.\n\nOh, and no one from, like, legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs. Oops. Oh, and Ross was like, what? A lion tamer?\n\nHey. Hey. What's going on, Lauren? Everybody at the restaurant still hates me. Is it because of the review you wrote or something new?\n\nIt's the review. I thought thought I was making headway. Everyone was smiling at me all day, and then I get off work and find out that they wrote this On my chef's hat. Hey. Maybe they meant to ride quiet, bitch.\n\nHey, honey. What's the matter? Fine. Just trying to be nice. I mean, I have not been picked on this much since I was in kindergarten, and They had to bring in someone from junior high to do the seesaw with me.\n\nOh. I mean, They're trying to do everything they can to make me quit. And if there were any other job, I would, but this is something I've been waiting for my whole life. Oh, honey. Wait a minute.\n\nYou're the boss. Yes. Why don't you just yell at them or fire them? I would love to, but I can't. But I just can't.\n\nYou know I'm not good at confrontation. Hey. You know what you could do? I remember reading about this director. I think it was, Orson Welles, who at the beginning of a movie would hire somebody just so he could fire them in front of everybody.\n\nThen they would all know who was boss. Hey. Come on. I'm not doing anything. Why don't you fire me?\n\nIt's a good idea. Do you know how to waiter? Good enough to get fired. Alright. You're hired.\n\nHey. Oh. That must be why I got fired last week. Does this Orson Welles guy direct Burger King commercials? Yes.\n\nI say, Drew, are you seeing anybody right now? Oh, I'm I'm not asking for me. I've you know, I'm not I'm not gay. I'm not asking you out. I'm I'm not gay.\n\nI didn't think you were gay. I do now. See, my friend my friend Rachel, she wants to be set up. You know, I just got out of a big relationship. I'm not looking for anything serious.\n\nWell, you know, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling. That might be alright with Rachel. Woah. Woah. Woah.\n\nWoah. Woah. Is this hot Rachel that you took to the Christmas Rachel? Oh, by the way, that is her full name. Oh, wow.\n\nI'm free for her. Wait a second. I didn't say I wasn't free. Hey, Chandler. Why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?\n\nMhmm. Hold on. You know, I just got a box of Cubans. Maybe I bring them by our office around, 5? Well, that's a little later than I, generally care to stay, but sure.\n\nMaybe before the game, we can enjoy some 8 year old small batch basil hadans. Oh, I don't know what that is, but, it's a pretty nice jack. Kinda like that tie too. Keep your pants on, man. Hey.\n\nYou guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you wanna hear it? Yeah. Of course. Okay.\n\nHappy Hanukkah, Monica. May your Christmas be snowy, Joey. That's great. Oh, yay. But, you know, Rachel doesn't rhyme with Dreidel.\n\nI know, but it's so hard. Nothing rhymes with your stupid name. Oh, what are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel, Mayo, jail, bail, cable, maple.\n\nAll good. Thanks. Do you maybe have, like, a nickname that's easier to write? Oh. Did your dad used to call you pumpkin?\n\nOh, yeah. Pumpkin. Yeah. But did he ever call you, like, Budolph? Hello, children.\n\nHey. Hi. Have I got the 50 guys For you. Really? Oh, yeah.\n\nI just showed them this picture of you, and guys are throwing themselves at me. They're buying me drinks. They're giving me stuff. Next tonight? Sure.\n\nWhere are the seats? Wherever. I've got, like, 20. So will I like any of these guys? Oh, you know what?\n\nI'm gonna, I'll play the field just a little bit more. Guys are signing over their 4 zero one k's to me. You work with robots? Yes. Okay.\n\nThere is this 1 guy, Patrick. I think you're gonna like him. He's really nice. He's funny. He's a swimmer.\n\nOh, I like swimmer's bodies. Oh, yes. And his father invented that magnetic strip on credit cards. Oh, I like credit cards. See?\n\nNot bad at this fixing up thing. So what does he do? He works in the fine foods division. Your company has a fine foods division? It's a big company.\n\nI don't if you I now wait a second. You make food and robots? No. The robots just work for them. Alright.\n\nI'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that? Yeah, lady. I do. I got a problem with that.\n\nYou want a problem, I'll give you a problem. What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me? You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you. See you later.\n\nThanks. Oh, well, I should get going. I've I've got a date tonight. Oh, yeah? With who?\n\nDo you know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie? Yeah. Yeah? Not her. Yeah.\n\nThis is someone else I met, and I I can't decide between the 2 of them. You know, the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a 2 hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right off town. You know? She's, well, she's she's just as pretty.\n\nI guess she's smart. She's not fun. She's no fun. Why do wanna date her at all? Well, I I wanna give her another chance.\n\nYou know? She lives so close. And at the end of the date, the the other time, she She said something that was, if she was kidding, was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist. Hey.\n\nHey. Hey, man. Hey. Oh, how was your 1st day working at the restaurant? Damn.\n\nHey. Hey. Oh, what happened to your fancy chef jacket? They baked it. I can't take this anymore.\n\nI'm I'm gonna call a meeting. I'm gonna fire you tonight. You got it. Whoop. Whoop.\n\nWhat are you doing? Still a tiny bit on fire there. Oh, good job. Thanks. Listen.\n\nI think you got it. Chandler, you have the best taste in men. Well, like father likes them. Patrick and I had such a great time last night. I mean, I think this could maybe turn into something serious.\n\nReally? I I thought you weren't even looking for something serious. I thought you were looking for some kind of, fling. Well, you know, possibly. You didn't tell him that though.\n\nRight? No. You told this guy that I was looking for a fling? You don't tell the guy that.
