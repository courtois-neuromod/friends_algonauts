Joe Tribiani. America. Hello? Hey. I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding. We don't have to. Oh, oh, what? You found a place? No. But Monica and I were talking, and and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down. And she suggested that we just put the wedding off for a bit. She said what? She said if I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we can find in a day, well, then we should just postpone it. Postpone it. Emily, do you think Monica realizes how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you think my sister's teeny, tiny, little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to 1,000 of miles to be here. This isn't right. I realize that people are gonna be disappointed, but I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right. Well, I can't ask people to do that. Would you ask people to do that? Don't you point your pants at me. We have no choice. Anywhere that's half decent will have been bought months ago. Ross, don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about. The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married. So what are you saying? It's now or never? No. I'm saying it's now. Or? There's no or in mine. What is wrong with these pants? It's not the pants. It's you that moves backwards. And if and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well, then perhaps we shouldn't be getting married at all. What the hell? And we go. Wait. Stop. And we plead to Oh. Dang. Hi. So did shopping help you feel any better about Ross? Manhattan does not have enough stores. Well, I think I can help you get over him. You can? Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross K. And, a small piece of chocolate And a glass of tepid water. Oh, is this one of those things where you throw a bunch of stuff in a bed with some graveyard dirt and then hang it from a north facing tree? Only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah. The pictures are for you. The chocolate and the water is for me. I just didn't feel like getting Okay. I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all the bad things about him. Alright? Really Focus on his flaws. I can do that. Certainly did that while we were going out. Okay. Before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross. I think he is such a great guy. Okay. Now close your eyes and imagine that you're with Ross. Okay? And imagine that you're kissing Mhmm. And you're you're running your hands all over his body, and then you run your hands through his hair, but, oh, ew, gross. It's Some kind of grease. It's gross. I don't know. I don't his, his hair never bothered me that much. And, you know, it was it was always more crunchy than it was greasy. Okay. Harder than I thought. Let's try some, aversion therapy. Okay? Okay? Alright. Alright. So, yeah, look at the picture. Okay. Alright. And Hey. How do you feel now? Well, I'd like you less. Wow. This is just as boring in England. Hey. Sorry. No. No. You know what? I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me. I mean, that really wasn't Cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day. Me too. Yeah? No. They had the best day ever. Dude, check this up. I'm never gonna fast forward past the part with you because it is boring. Hey. Okay. So say hi to my friend and tell me you like my hat. Okay. So, what's your friend's name? Chanda. Cool. Hi, Chanda. That's Okay. It's really good. It's burgundy. Jerry says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kinda dashing. So I hear you're single now. Yeah. I didn't even have that much. How did you when did you Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace. Right? So I'm in my map, and and hey. Hey. Hey. I understand you had a little talk with Emily. Yes. I did. And you are welcome. Am I? And was it your idea to postpone the wedding? Hey. Hey. Since you're the fix it lady, here's a pickle. What do you do when the bride says she doesn't wanna have the wedding at all? She said that? Yeah. Why? I don't know. I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone, and she, like, flipped out. Oh my god. You're even dumber than I am. Excuse me? Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding? I don't know. A month? Emily has probably been planning it since she was 5 ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did. We dreamed about the perfect wedding in the perfect place With the perfect 4 tiered wedding cake with the little people on top. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was. I had no idea. And that that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun. Sometimes we work. Come on. You're gonna help me figure out what to do. Okay. Come on. Well, pretty intense. Yeah. Yeah. Hope Bras didn't think we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here. I hope he did. Oh, I thought of a good flaw. Ross pops his gum. Right. Wait a minute. I do that too. Yeah. I know. It drives me crazy. I'll get it. Hello? Hey, Pheebs. It's Joey. Hey, Joey. Hey. Oh, oh, I just saw someone, that looks just like you on the Subway. And I was gonna go over and say hi, but then I figured he doesn't care he looks like you. That just cost me $4. But, listen. I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing. Oh, they're having a great time with their aunt Phoebe. Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So do you miss me? Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun. Oh, so you're not homesick yet? No. I don't think so. Alright. Well, the 7 of us miss you. Who's 7? You know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies. All the babies miss me? Of course, they do. Oh, I'm just really hungry. Oh, the pizza guy's here. Wait. You ordered pizza without me? Yeah. But, you know, we were thinking about you. You know, we ordered the Joey special. Two pizzas? Yep. Okay. Gotta go. Talk to you later. Wait. Wait. Where did you get it from? Where everybody knows your name. I don't know it's Monica, why Have you brought me here of all places? We'll see. I tell you, this wedding is not gonna happen. Okay. But but imagine a lot more lights. Okay? And and, you know, fewer bricks and and and flowers And candles. Okay. And the musicians, they can go over here. Okay? And the chairs, they can face this way, and you go. But but if you don't love this, then we'll do it any other place, any other time. Really. It's fine. Whatever you want. It's perfect. And I don't know. If it starts to rain Well, then we'll get wet. Oh, I even have a date. Eaves? Yeah? Do You remember where the duck food is? Yeah. It's in the guy's apartment under the sink. Why? Because I'm going to London. What? What do you mean you're going to London? Yeah. I have to tell Ross that I love him. No, honey. You take care, and you don't have those babies till I get back. But what about all the finding his flaws Stuff we've been doing. Yeah. That didn't work. Rachel, you can't go. Ross loves Emily. Yeah. I know. I know. I know he does, but I have to tell him how I feel. He deserves to have all of the information, and then he can make an informed decision. That's not how you're going. You're going because you hope he's gonna say, yeah. I love you too, Rach. Forget about that British chippy. Do you think he will? No. Because he's in love with the British chippy. If you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding. You know? It's too late. You missed your chance. I'm sorry. I know this must be really hard. It's over. You know what? No. It's not over until someone says I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. Ugh. I feel like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter. The Waltham residence. Oh, yes.

Joe Tribiani. America. Hello? Hey.\n\nI just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding. We don't have to. Oh, oh, what? You found a place?\n\nNo. But Monica and I were talking, and and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down. And she suggested that we just put the wedding off for a bit. She said what? She said if I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we can find in a day, well, then we should just postpone it.\n\nPostpone it. Emily, do you think Monica realizes how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you think my sister's teeny, tiny, little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to 1,000 of miles to be here. This isn't right. I realize that people are gonna be disappointed, but I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.\n\nWell, I can't ask people to do that. Would you ask people to do that? Don't you point your pants at me. We have no choice. Anywhere that's half decent will have been bought months ago.\n\nRoss, don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about. The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married. So what are you saying?\n\nIt's now or never? No. I'm saying it's now. Or? There's no or in mine.\n\nWhat is wrong with these pants? It's not the pants. It's you that moves backwards. And if and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well, then perhaps we shouldn't be getting married at all. What the hell?\n\nAnd we go. Wait. Stop. And we plead to Oh. Dang.\n\nHi. So did shopping help you feel any better about Ross? Manhattan does not have enough stores. Well, I think I can help you get over him. You can?\n\nYeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross K. And, a small piece of chocolate And a glass of tepid water. Oh, is this one of those things where you throw a bunch of stuff in a bed with some graveyard dirt and then hang it from a north facing tree? Only if you have the hiccups too.\n\nYeah. The pictures are for you. The chocolate and the water is for me. I just didn't feel like getting Okay. I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross.\n\nOkay? And you're going to remember all the bad things about him. Alright? Really Focus on his flaws. I can do that.\n\nCertainly did that while we were going out. Okay. Before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross. I think he is such a great guy. Okay.\n\nNow close your eyes and imagine that you're with Ross. Okay? And imagine that you're kissing Mhmm. And you're you're running your hands all over his body, and then you run your hands through his hair, but, oh, ew, gross. It's Some kind of grease.\n\nIt's gross. I don't know. I don't his, his hair never bothered me that much. And, you know, it was it was always more crunchy than it was greasy. Okay.\n\nHarder than I thought. Let's try some, aversion therapy. Okay? Okay? Alright.\n\nAlright. So, yeah, look at the picture. Okay. Alright. And Hey.\n\nHow do you feel now? Well, I'd like you less. Wow. This is just as boring in England. Hey.\n\nSorry. No. No. You know what? I'm sorry.\n\nI really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me. I mean, that really wasn't Cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day. Me too. Yeah?\n\nNo. They had the best day ever. Dude, check this up. I'm never gonna fast forward past the part with you because it is boring. Hey.\n\nOkay. So say hi to my friend and tell me you like my hat. Okay. So, what's your friend's name? Chanda.\n\nCool. Hi, Chanda. That's Okay. It's really good. It's burgundy.\n\nJerry says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kinda dashing. So I hear you're single now. Yeah. I didn't even have that much. How did you when did you Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace.\n\nRight? So I'm in my map, and and hey. Hey. Hey. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.\n\nYes. I did. And you are welcome. Am I? And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?\n\nHey. Hey. Since you're the fix it lady, here's a pickle. What do you do when the bride says she doesn't wanna have the wedding at all? She said that?\n\nYeah. Why? I don't know. I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone, and she, like, flipped out. Oh my god.\n\nYou're even dumber than I am. Excuse me? Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding? I don't know. A month?\n\nEmily has probably been planning it since she was 5 ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did. We dreamed about the perfect wedding in the perfect place With the perfect 4 tiered wedding cake with the little people on top. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was. I had no idea.\n\nAnd that that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun. Sometimes we work. Come on. You're gonna help me figure out what to do. Okay.\n\nCome on. Well, pretty intense. Yeah. Yeah. Hope Bras didn't think we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here.\n\nI hope he did. Oh, I thought of a good flaw. Ross pops his gum. Right. Wait a minute.\n\nI do that too. Yeah. I know. It drives me crazy. I'll get it.\n\nHello? Hey, Pheebs. It's Joey. Hey, Joey. Hey.\n\nOh, oh, I just saw someone, that looks just like you on the Subway. And I was gonna go over and say hi, but then I figured he doesn't care he looks like you. That just cost me $4. But, listen. I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing.\n\nOh, they're having a great time with their aunt Phoebe. Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So do you miss me? Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun. Oh, so you're not homesick yet?\n\nNo. I don't think so. Alright. Well, the 7 of us miss you. Who's 7?\n\nYou know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies. All the babies miss me? Of course, they do. Oh, I'm just really hungry. Oh, the pizza guy's here.\n\nWait. You ordered pizza without me? Yeah. But, you know, we were thinking about you. You know, we ordered the Joey special.\n\nTwo pizzas? Yep. Okay. Gotta go. Talk to you later.\n\nWait. Wait. Where did you get it from? Where everybody knows your name. I don't know it's Monica, why Have you brought me here of all places?\n\nWe'll see. I tell you, this wedding is not gonna happen. Okay. But but imagine a lot more lights. Okay?\n\nAnd and, you know, fewer bricks and and and flowers And candles. Okay. And the musicians, they can go over here. Okay? And the chairs, they can face this way, and you go.\n\nBut but if you don't love this, then we'll do it any other place, any other time. Really. It's fine. Whatever you want. It's perfect.\n\nAnd I don't know. If it starts to rain Well, then we'll get wet. Oh, I even have a date. Eaves? Yeah?\n\nDo You remember where the duck food is? Yeah. It's in the guy's apartment under the sink. Why? Because I'm going to London.\n\nWhat? What do you mean you're going to London? Yeah. I have to tell Ross that I love him. No, honey.\n\nYou take care, and you don't have those babies till I get back. But what about all the finding his flaws Stuff we've been doing. Yeah. That didn't work. Rachel, you can't go.\n\nRoss loves Emily. Yeah. I know. I know. I know he does, but I have to tell him how I feel.\n\nHe deserves to have all of the information, and then he can make an informed decision. That's not how you're going. You're going because you hope he's gonna say, yeah. I love you too, Rach. Forget about that British chippy.\n\nDo you think he will? No. Because he's in love with the British chippy. If you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding. You know?\n\nIt's too late. You missed your chance. I'm sorry. I know this must be really hard. It's over.\n\nYou know what? No. It's not over until someone says I do. I do. I do.\n\nI do. I do. Ugh. I feel like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.\n\nThe Waltham residence. Oh, yes.
