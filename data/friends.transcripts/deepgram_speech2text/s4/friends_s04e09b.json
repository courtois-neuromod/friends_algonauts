I got a whole bunch of, of stuff in this area, but, I'm I'm getting the feeling that you don't wanna deliver. No. Okay.

Oh my goodness. You haven't heard. Heard what? Joanna passed away last night. Oh my god. How? Well, she was leaving work, and she was hit by a cat. Oh my god. Oh, I cannot believe it. I know. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. I didn't realize that you were so close. Yes. So close. Missus Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time for all of us. Well, by any chance, did Joanna send any paperwork your way before it happened? No. Nothing. Imagine if she just stepped off that curb a few seconds later. Oh, yes. Yes. Just a few seconds, and she'd still be with us. Nothing about an assistant buyer. I'm I'm okay. I have to come. Good morning. Oh, Sophie. Guess you didn't hear about Joanna. I sure did. I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emilio, it is like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please tell your father how much we're going to miss him. Now I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place. Well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new Head chef.

You can have your own office and a raise effective tomorrow. I need an expense account. Done.\n\nAnd an assistant. Sophie, get in here. However, now it seems like a lifetime, doesn't it? It started to refuse Hey. What are you guys doing here?\n\nI thought you'd be out partying with Gandalf for It's Gandalf, and he's not coming. So you've just been sitting around here all morning? Exchanging the vows with her ex husband. I balanced my checkbook. Yeah.\n\nAnd I I gave first names to all the foosball players. I can't believe he didn't come. So what if he didn't come? We could still go out and party ourselves. I don't know.\n\nYou know what? Gandalf would be out all night. Yeah. We'd meet we'd meet total strangers and hang out with them. Well, we could do that.\n\nThere was other stuff too. We'll do it all and better. Look. After tonight, Gandalf, I wanna party with us, dude. Come on.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not like we don't know how to party. Yeah.\n\nAlright. Let's go. And may maybe we could end up on a boat again? Yeah. Oh, no.\n\nHey. Hey. When, when were we on a boat? Remember that really cold morning when you woke up and those dogs were licking your face? Yeah.\n\nYeah. Those were seals, man. Hey, Juan. Little question for you. How do you think the suit would look on an assistant Okay.\n\nThe owner, Valis Sanders, came over here to yell at me, but instead, I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef. Oh my god. You just ruined the thing. I was the whole way home, but I'm so happy. Can you believe it?\n\nI finally get to run my own kitchen. Oh, you Waited so long. No. Oh, totally. Yay.\n\nHey, Phoebes. Quick question for you. Yeah. How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's? I don't know.\n\nI totally depend on her coloring. And, you got the job. You got the job. Why didn't you tell me? Oh, it's gonna be so great.\n\nI'm gonna get to Decide what we sell. I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything.

Well, I I I think it might be time for me to take a step back from the catering. But we've only had 1 job.\n\nI know. But now we have the second one, and it just it feels like it's snowballing. You know? Yeah. What are you saying?\n\nI got offered the head chef job at Alessandro's. What? It's okay. Because you know what? If you think about it, you don't really need me for the business.\n\nYou're the cook. Without you, it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and Skip for money. Alright. But, Well, I'll I'll I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van. For what?\n\nI can't believe this. Gotta get out of here. Phoebe, wait a minute. I'm an assistant buyer. Here.\n\nAlright. So we'll get a little coffee. We'll get energized, and we'll head back out. Alright. Okay.\n\nSo we're having fun. Right? We don't need that wizard guy. We'll hit a couple of clubs, talk to some strangers, and, after this, we'll go down to the docks and see about that boat thing. I'm kinda beeped.\n\nActually, me too. Are you serious? Yeah. Thank god. I'm exhausted.\n\nSo you guys want coffees? Yeah. But, I don't wanna be up too late, so I'll have a decaf. Yeah. Me too.\n\nActually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? Hey. Strain my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud? I can't hear a word you're saying.\n\nMy ears are ringing so bad. I was glad I brought that extra pair of socks. You know? I used them as mittens. I didn't wanna touch a thing in that last play.\n\nHow sad are we? Yeah. I know. You know what? We're not sad.\n\nThat's sad. We're just not 21 anymore. You know? I'm 29 years old, damn it, and I wanna sit in a comfortable chair and watch television and go to sleep at a reasonable hour. Yeah.\n\nYeah. And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I could talk to my friends. Yeah. Yeah. And so what if I'd like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath.\n\nWe're 29. We're not women. Oh, there you are. K. I'm I'm glad that you decided to hear me out.\n\nOkay. I'm hearing. Okay. I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot.\n\nAnd, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses that you can do with your van. K. You could be a flower delivery person. What? Or a bakery delivery person.\n\nPizza. Alright. I got a whole bunch of, of stuff in this area, but, I'm I'm getting the feeling that you don't wanna deliver. No. Okay.\n\nAnd I'm guessing if you don't wanna deliver, you probably don't wanna pick up stuff either. No. You know what? Let's do the catering business. Really?\n\nAre you sure? Yeah. You know, I I made a commitment to you, and, you know, it it'd be fun. Oh, it will be fun. It's true.\n\nYay. Okay. Oh, let's plan the wedding reception. Okay. Wow.\n\nYou really wanted me to do something with this van. You know what? I want you to take the chef job. Really? Yeah.\n\nThat's what you really want. Yeah. I don't wanna be the reason you're unhappy. That would just make me unhappy, and I really don't wanna be the reason I'm unhappy. Thank you.\n\nBesides, it might be kinda fun to form the new a team. Oh, hi, missus Lynch. Is Joanna in already? Oh my goodness. You haven't heard.\n\nHeard what? Joanna passed away last night. Oh my god. How? Well, she was leaving work, and she was hit by a cat.\n\nOh my god. Oh, I cannot believe it. I know. Oh god. Oh god.\n\nOh god. I didn't realize that you were so close. Yes. So close. Missus Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time for all of us.\n\nWell, by any chance, did Joanna send any paperwork your way before it happened? No. Nothing. Imagine if she just stepped off that curb a few seconds later. Oh, yes.\n\nYes. Just a few seconds, and she'd still be with us. Nothing about an assistant buyer. I'm I'm okay. I have to come.\n\nGood morning. Oh, Sophie. Guess you didn't hear about Joanna. I sure did. I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us.\n\nAlthough I do feel bad about having fired chef Emilio, it is like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please tell your father how much we're going to miss him. Now I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place. Well, you all read the review.\n\nSo without much further ado, I present to you our new Head chef. I just wanna say, that with a pinch of excitement, a dash of hard work, and a dab of cooperation, We can have the recipe.
