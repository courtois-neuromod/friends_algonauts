You don't tell the guy that. Why not? I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get oh, I see. Between you telling him I wanna have a fling and me putting out on the 1st date, oh, he's still gonna get the wrong idea.\n\nHey, Joey. Could you pass the juice? Yeah. Listen, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey because since I don't know anyone here, I thought it might be fun to try out a cool work nickname. Hey, dragon.\n\nHere's your tips for Monday and Tuesday. Oh, Looks like there's, like, $300 in this one. Yeah. People get pretty generous around the holidays, and it never hurts to wear tight trousers. Okay.\n\nCould the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay. 1st, there's a Chilean sea bass prepared with a mango relish Jonna Beth, why is nobody writing these down? Because we can remember them. And because you're all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?\n\nWell, sure. That too. Okay. Forget the specials for a minute. Are you here's the thing.\n\nFor the last 2 weeks, I have, tried really hard to create a positive Atmosphere. Can't hear you. Positive atmosphere. But I I I've had it up to here. From now on, it is going to be my way or the highway.\n\nAlright? Does anybody have a problem with that? Hey, new guy. I said, does anybody have a problem with that? No, ma'am.\n\nHey. He has a name. It's dragon. You wanna know your name? Check your hat.\n\nYou get the hat. Right? What the hell just happened? I am so, So sorry. I I was gonna do it, really.\n\nBut then I was standing there with $327 in one hand and $238 in the other hand, and I was thinking, wow. It's been a long time since I had 3127 plus $238. Joey, we had a deal. That that's why you're here. I've got to fire you.\n\nAnd I gotta pay rent. Look. How how about this? You don't fire me. Instead, I stay here, I gain their trust, and then they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.\n\nKinda things you've been saying. Well, well, nothing yet. They really hate you, and I wanna fit in. Happy, happy Hanukkah, Chandler and Monica. Mary, Mary, and You know you know what, Pheebs?\n\nWhat? I'm not Jewish. So So Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining, do you? Bad dream? I wasn't sleeping.\n\nOh, yeah? Then, what was Phoebe's song about? It's, the one with the cat. I gotta go. I got another date.\n\nOh, so did you pick 1 yet? No. It turns out the one from Uptown was making a joke, but it was a different joke than I thought. It wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn.\n\nWell, look. You know, you don't really like the one from uptown, and you're too exhausted from dating the one in Poughkeepsie. So I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie, and you break up with her.\n\nAnd on your way back, you break up with Uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done. You know what? You're right. Thank you.\n\nYeah. Well, I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague. Frog? So much you don't know. Handler, Patrick just, ended things with me.\n\nDid you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship? I did. I absolutely did. You idiot. I'm sure you're right, but why?\n\nYou don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship. You don't tell the guy that. Now you scared him away. Oh, man. I am sorry.\n\nI am so, so sorry. You know, You should never be allowed to talk to people. I know. I know. Oh, teachers, and now I'm right back where I started.\n\nOh, this Sucks. Being alone sucks. You know what? You're you're gonna meet somebody. You're a great catch.\n\nYou know, when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once. Really? Yeah. You graduated Magna Cum Laude. Right?\n\nNo. It doesn't matter. Hey. You know what? I got 2 tickets to tonight's Ranger game.\n\nYou wanna come with me? Cute guys in little shorts? Sure. Well, actually, it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth. Well, that sounds fun too.\n\nThank you. Okay. Have you ever been with a woman? What? Chandler, what is the matter with you?\n\nSo there is no good time to ask that question. Station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie. Ross? Ross?\n\nWake up. Ross? Ross? Ross? Ross?\n\nSauce? Sauce? I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish? I don't speak English.\n\nYou did a minute ago. Well, I don't know what to tell you. Fine. Okay. Very funny.\n\nSomebody let me out, please? Come on. I'm cold. I'm covered in marinara sauce. Come on.\n\nLet me You found that handle, did you? It's not funny. Well, that's not true. I'm a good person, and I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara stuff all over me. You know what?\n\nIf you want me to quit this band, then all you have to Hey. Chef Geller. That little speech you made the other day, well, I got a problem with it. You do? You bet I do.\n\nI just, Wasn't listening then. That's all. Well, if you want a problem, I'll give you a problem. What are you gonna do here? Are you gonna fire me?\n\nYou bet your ass I'm gonna fire you. Then get out of my kitchen. Get out. Alright. Anybody else got a problem?\n\nHow about you, Chuckles? You think this is funny now? No. How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? You think it's funny now?\n\nNo. It's really good. Good. Then take those salads to table 4, and you get the swordfish, And you, get a haircut. Last stop, Montreal.\n\nThe stop is What? I made a bet with myself that you had beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win. We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?\n\nAre we really in Montreal? Yes. We are. So coffee? Coffee sounds great.\n\nWait. So so you live in Montreal? Oh, no. But it's just a 2 hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia. Well, I guess I should've thought about my wife and It's before I talk back to chef Gellahan.\n\nThanks. Yep. Looks like it's gonna be a lean Christmas at the dragon house this year. Enough. Ling.\n\nLing. Ling. So, this is a a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me. Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap, Asked him to bring my friends all kinds of crap. Said all you need is to write them a song.\n\nThey haven't heard it yet, so don't try to sing along. No. Don't sing along. Monica, Monica, have a happy Hanukkah. Saw Santa a class.\n\nHe said hello to Ross. And please tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy. Blender.
