Can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her?\n\nYeah. Thank you. Hate it when Ross is right. He is right, isn't he? You know what?\n\nI think this might be one of the times when he's wrong. Think? Oh, no. He's right. Hi.\n\nHi. Hey. Pheebs, about your mom. Yeah? How's that going?\n\nSo great. We took a nap together today. My mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred. That's so sweet. I'm gonna get some coffee.\n\nWhat'd you say, Joe? I'll be right there. Pheebs, I just feel so Alright. I don't know. Already.\n\nHello, Chip. Hey, Reg. How are you doing? I'm great. I'm great.\n\nGot a great job at Bloomingdale's. I have wonderful friends.

It was funny till I started feeling like I was in a coffin. No.\n\nYou you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough. Oh, yeah? If I can't, I'll knock $5 off the price of the unit.
