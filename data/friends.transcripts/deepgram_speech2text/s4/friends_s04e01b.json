But this breakup was not all my fault. And she she says here, if you accept full responsibility Full responsibility. I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do? Does it? No. That's not Look, Ross. You have what you want. You're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now, you're gonna wreck the best thing that ever happened to you. Yeah. I know. I I know. You're right. Yeah. I guess I'll let it go. But you you understand Stan, how how hard it is to forget about this. Sure. It's hard to forget, but that doesn't mean you have to talk about it. A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never ever talk about. What the hell happened on that beach? It's between us and the sea, Ross. Hi, Ursula. Hey. Okay. Well, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but, okay. Our mom is not our birth mom. This this other lady is our birth mom. Right. Okay. The one that lives in Montauk. Mhmm. You know her?

I've seen this thing on the Discovery Channel. Wait a minute. I saw that on the Discovery Channel. Yeah. About jellyfish and how if you Ew. You peed on yourself? Ew. You can't say that. You you don't know. I mean, I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain. Anyway, I I tried, I but I I couldn't been that way. So That's right. I stepped up. She's my friend, and she needed help.

I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do? Does it?\n\nNo. That's not Look, Ross. You have what you want. You're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now, you're gonna wreck the best thing that ever happened to you.\n\nYeah. I know. I I know. You're right. Yeah.\n\nI guess I'll let it go. But you you understand Stan, how how hard it is to forget about this. Sure. It's hard to forget, but that doesn't mean you have to talk about it. A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never ever talk about.\n\nWhat the hell happened on that beach? It's between us and the sea, Ross. Hi, Ursula. Hey. Okay.\n\nWell, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but, okay. Our mom is not our birth mom. This this other lady is our birth mom. Right. Okay.\n\nThe one that lives in Montauk. Mhmm. You know her? No. I, I read about her in mom's suicide note.\n\nThere there was a suicide note? Do you still have it? Hang on. I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note.

I came back with nothing all over me. Come on. What happened, Joey?\n\nAlright. No. Joey, we swear we'd never tell. They'll never understand. Well, we have to say something.\n\nWe have to get it out. It's eating me alive. Monica got stung by a jellyfish. Alright. Alright.\n\nI got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I I couldn't walk. We were 2 miles from the house.\n\nWe were scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it. I was in too much pain. And I was tired from digging the huge hole. And then Joey remembered something.\n\nI've seen this thing on the Discovery Channel. Wait a minute. I saw that on the Discovery Channel. Yeah. About jellyfish and how if you Ew.\n\nYou peed on yourself? Ew. You can't say that. You you don't know.

If I had to, I'd pee on any one of you.\n\nOnly, I couldn't. I got to stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was just too much pressure. So so I, I turned to Chandler. Joy kept screaming at me.\n\nDo it now. Do it. Do it. Do it now. Sometimes late at night, I can still hear the screaming.\n\nThat's because sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out. Maybe there's somebody that you guys could talk Who? Now who? It's not like they have a group for people like us. Yeah.\n\nNo. There's this guy, Owen. He's the best. I might have his card.
