Can can you hold on just 1 minute? No. You have to let me in right now.\n\nAre you alone? Yes. Alright. This sucks. Didn't know I had to stay up all night before I go to this stupid sleep clinic?\n\nI'm so tired. It's 6 o'clock. Hi. Hey. I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's I think that's really cool.\n\nYeah, Rach. I think you're handling that really well. Handling it? I didn't mean handling it. There's nothing to handle.\n\nYou know, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. You know, they're not gonna get married anyway. What? Come on. They rushed into this Thanks so fast.\n\nIt's ridiculous. I mean, they're gonna be engaged for, like, what, a year. And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realize what they've done, and they're gonna call the whole thing off. I'm telling you, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at theirs. You know, I don't dance at weddings.\n\nWhy not? Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this. Hey, man. Hey. So what are you guys doing 4 weeks from today?\n\nNothing. Nothing. I am Free. Great. Because Emily and I are getting married in a month.\n\nWhat? Yep. In a month? Yeah. You mean you mean 30 days?\n\nYeah. From now? Yeah. That's great. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it's gonna be torn down. So, I mean, I I know it's crazy, but everything up to now has been so crazy, and I don't know. It it just feels right. You know?\n\nHey. That's the day after I start menstruating.
