And you said it was gonna be fun, which it kind of is. Also, you said there were gonna be other guys here. There are no other guys here.\n\nChandler, there's a guy right over there. That's a mailman. That's our mailman. Chandler, don't worry. This doesn't make you any less of a guy.\n\nThat does. What am I sitting on? I'd hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off. Hey. You know, who used to have nails like that?\n\nOh. Oh My god. Joey, let me ask you a question. This has been driving me crazy. What does the slight switch do?\n\nNothing. Did it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did? I know what it did. Nothing. They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something.\n\nHow can you not care? Like this. Well, here's another question for you. Do you know what that little silver knob on the toilet does? Sure.\n\nFlushes it. Okay. Good. Now the since you know, when you come over, would you mind actually using it? Hello?\n\nHey. Oh my god. Wow. Guess who we ran into today? Jonas?\n\nIs this amazing? How have you been? Well, I'm divorced. Wow. Yeah.\n\nI'm riding the alimony Lamony pony. Oh, there it is. I just came up to say hi. Hi. And you, sweetie, I'll see you later.\n\nOkay. I'll see you tonight. Okay. Bye. Bye.\n\nBye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.\n\nBut I'm fine. I can't stand the woman. What? I thought you were crazy about her. I know.\n\nBut you know those little annoying things that she did before we fell in love, you know, like her her voice and her laugh and her personality, they're all back. You know? And she's picked up, like, 9 new ones. So what are you doing bringing her here? There's people here.\n\nDon't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight. You are not. You have never been able to break up with her. Well, I don't have to break up with her this time.\n\nWe're not involved. I'm gonna do a preemptive strike. I'm gonna end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen. Yeah.\n\nTry sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm telling you. I can't believe you really walk alone here at night. I mean, you hear such stories about New York. No.\n\nIt's it's really not that bad. I mean, I I, for 1, feel perfectly safe. Liam. Help. Help.\n\nHelp. No. No. No. Ross.\n\nRoss, these are friends mine from home. Liam Devon, this is Ross. Hi, mate. Hey. How are you, man?\n\nThat was a good one. Help. Help. So how are you? I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived, but, well, I've been rather busy.\n\nDo you realize we have not seen each other since the night that U2 concert? Oh my god. I think you're right. Well, actually, the last time you and I saw each other was the next morning. Oh, Liam.\n\nOh, Liam. So, what? Were you guys Playing soccer or some or or should I call it football? We were playing rugby. In fact, we're playing a game at the park tomorrow.\n\nYou're welcome to play too if you want. Ross play rugby? I don't think so. What? What's so funny about that?\n\nWell, I mean, you're American to start with. You don't really have rugby here. Well, we didn't have freedom here until 17/76 either, Osama. So good then. We'll see you at Riverside Pocket 2.\n\nCheers. Cheers. Oh, boy. I I just love to sing. Yes.\n\nI I know that you do. I think one of the reasons people were complaining, though, was because most of the people had paid to hear the actor saying old man river. Oh, look at us. Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails? Okay.\n\nWe have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious Relationship. I know. And I'm just getting out of a marriage. I mean, talk about meant to be.\n\nRight. But I just think this is happening too soon. Oh, too soon. Too shmoon. Makes it, honey.\n\nI am not letting you get away this time. I hear you. But, unfortunately, my company He's transferring me overseas. Oh, no. Where to?\n\nTo Paris? No. No. Not not Paris. Oh, to London?\n\nOh, you're Rome, Vienna. Oh, oh, Barcelona. Okay. Could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen.\n\nThat's right. Yes. I'm being transferred to Yemen. When? I don't know exactly.\n\nWell, I will just Have to soak up every ounce of Chandler Bing until that moment comes. But I do know it's sometime tomorrow. Done? Yep. Hey.\n\nHey. Hey. What's up? The switch thing has been driving me crazy, so I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now 4 of them don't work, which means 1 of them has to be controlled by the switch.\n\nSo I plugged in things, then all 4 outlets that that make noise. That way when I turn it on, I just follow the noise and find out which one it is. I better stop listening for you, dude. You know, you you also you could've used, lamps and then followed the light. Yeah.\n\nWell, I'm using noise. K. Alright. So everybody ready? Here we go.\n\nI hear something. I hear something. Where is it? It's coming from Joey. Oh my god.\n\nThat's so freaky. Turn him off. Goes back to England with the set scrum on set field. Oh, hey. Hi.\n\nCould we put on the news? I think it might be raining. No. Just hold on a sec. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN.\n\nI don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport. Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport. Hey there, Ross. Hey.\n\nJanice. You know, You really didn't have to help me pack. Oh, well, when you said all you were gonna be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you really didn't leave me much choice, did you? Well, I thought I did, but I I guess I did not. Hey.\n\nWhat's going on? Oh, I'm packing. You know, I'm I'm packing because I'm moving to Yemen Tomorrow. Thanks for telling me. I'm gonna pretend moving to Yemen.\n\nOkay? It's the only way I can get rid of her. Oh, good one. And Yemen, that actually sounds like a real country. Hey, Chandler.\n\nCome on. I'm gonna show you how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver. Yeah. No.\n\nI do that because it makes me look taller. Okay, Chandler. Come on. Okay. Joey, treat lies at me.\n\nNope. Man, look at this. Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean, look how brutal this is. Hey.\n\nI can handle it. Alright? Please, Ross. You you got hurt playing badminton with my dad. That's because your mom's dog kept kept Looking at me.\n\nOkay, Ross. Look. Look. Look. Look.\n\nLook. Look. Look. Right here.

It's so funny.\n\nOh, I see. You did that. Alright. Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was, like, hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am.\n\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right. You're right. You are a tough guy.\n\nYou are the toughest paleontologist I know. Alright. Well, look. Ross could take care of himself.
