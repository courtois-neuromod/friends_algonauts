Now see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and, Frank wants to name 1 of the boy babies Frank Junior Junior.\n\nWouldn't that be Frank the third? Don't get me started. Anyway, Since there are 3 babies and, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honored if you would name the other Boy baby. Oh, wow. That's so nice.\n\nOh. Oh, cougar. You think about it. Left your bra drive on the shower, Rod. You don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatized?\n\nHey. Mommy can have a wife. Daddy can have a bra. Oh, it's time to go. Oh, no.\n\nNo. No. See, that that clock's a little fast. We we still have 17 minutes. What can we do in 17 minutes?\n\nTwice. Oh, that's ambitious. K. You can ignore that. It's That's Carol with your son.\n\nBelieve me. When he's older, he'll understand. I'll be right there. Hello. Hello.\n\nHey. Hi. Emily, this is Carol and Susan. Hey. It's so nice to finally meet you.\n\nGood to meet you. You know, Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week. Yeah. I'm so excited. I've never been there.\n\nOh, well, I'll show you around. Oh, that'd be great. Also, I was, hoping to catch a show, so if you can make any suggestions. Oh, there's tons of terrific stuff. I'll go with you.\n\nOh. Oh, look at you 2 bonding, making us late for the airport. So Are you alright? Oh, it's fine. It's fine.\n\nIt's just us getting along is difficult for him because he doesn't like me. What? Oh, come on. That's that's It's true. How did we lose?\n\nHey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Do we have a baby name No.\n\nIt's so hard. I went through this whole book and found nothing. I want a name that's really, like, you know, Strong and confident, you know, like like Exxon. Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid. Oh.\n\nOh, thanks. You want a strong name? How about the Hulk? Oh, I'm I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name Starting with the. Oh, what a good name.\n\nGo with Joe. Joe is your pal. Joe is your buddy. Where is everybody? Well, they're hanging out with Joey.\n\nYou know what? If you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on. Chandler's funny. He's sophisticated, he's very lovable once you get to know him.\n\nWell, hey. Joey's lovable too, but the thing about Joey is if you need him, he'll be there. Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, he might be a little late. But but he'll be there, and he'll bring you some cold soda if What you need him for is that you're really hot.\n\nHey. What did he say? What did he say? Well, I I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are both great names. Alright.\n\nI don't maybe I will just name him the Hulk. Oh, I shouldn't have mentioned it. That's what I wanted to name my kid. Hey, man. If you were hoping to sleep with Joshua for the 1st time tonight, which one of these would you wanna be wearing?\n\nYou know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes. Sorry. I'm just so excited. Been waiting for this for months.\n\nGot my hair colored. Got new sheets. Making him a very fancy meal. Mhmm. What am I making him, by the way?\n\nWell, you're making him a frisee salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, Wild rice, roasted asparagus, and salmon encrut. I thought I was making them filet mignon. Yeah. You were, but then you decided to make salmon because you had some leftover at the restaurant. And then you realized if you bitched about it, then you would stop Cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.\n\nWow. I really get crabby when I cook. I don't even know why you're going through all this trouble anyway. He's a guy. You'd actually serve the potato, and he'd still wanna have sex with you.\n\nYeah. Well, That is not how I operate. We gotta get a new game. Hey. Hey.\n\nHey. So, Emily called last night, and now you're giving me the message? Turns out that Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah. They're going to the theater together.\n\nThey're going to dinner. They're going horseback riding. God. Susan is so fun. Look.\n\nThis is just a little too familiar. Okay? For for, like, 6 months before Carol and I split up, all I heard was, My friend Susan is is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great.\n\nYou actually think that something could happen between Emily and Susan? Hey. They're going to the gym together. 2 women Stretching. You know, they they take a stand together.\n\nThings get a little playful. Didn't you see personal best? No. But I'm gonna. Hi.\n\nHi. You're crazy. Okay. This is Emily. Emily is straight.\n\nHow do you know? I mean, we thought Carol was straight before I married her. Yeah. Definitely. I don't like the name Russ.\n\nWhat a weird way to kick me when I'm down. No. No. No. I just I meant for the baby.\n\nOh, what's wrong with rice? Well, it's just, know, something like this would never happen to, like, the Hulk. You know? Actually, that that's not true. In the Incredible Hulk, number 72, doctor Bruce Banner found found you know, never mind.\n\nMy girlfriend's a lesbian. So I just said I'm definitely gonna go with either Joey or Chandler. Oh. Oh. Oh.\n\nOh. What? You gotta pick Joey. I mean, name 1 famous person named Chandler. Raymond Chandler.\n\nSomeone you didn't make up. There are no famous Joeys Except for Joey Buttafuoco. Yeah. That guy really hurt us. Well, how about a compromise then?\n\nOkay? What if it's, you know, Chanoe? Hey, look. Joey, come on. Think about it.\n\nFirst of all, he'll never be president. I mean, there's never gonna be a president Joey. Alright. Look, man. I don't wanna bring this up, but Chandler is the Stupidest name I ever heard in my life.\n\nIt's not even a name. It's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not. And then you put it together with Bing and forget about it.\n\nIt's a stupid, stupid, non name. Wow. You're you're right. I have a horrible, horrible knee. I'm sorry, man.\n\nI didn't I'm I'm sorry. I'm sorry. So I guess it's Joey then. I mean, This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.\n\nOh, please. Cooking soothes me. So dig in. Right. Oh, it all looks so good.\n\nOh my god. Oh, I know. My god. This is so this rice is I am so good. Behind you.\n\nOh, yeah. Sorry. They used to live here, and sometimes they migrate back over. Is there, is there some way that they could, Not be here. It's just that, a farm bird's really kinda freaking me out.\n\nOkay. Okay. Hey. How'd you do that? All gone.\n\nSo farmbirds, Yeah. It's it's it's my only weird thing. I swear. And I I I would've told you about it, but I didn't know that they would be here. So alright.\n\nOkay.
