So, here's my number. 555-9323.\n\nGive me a call later. Chip is Chip Matthews. The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you? Because I ran into him at the bank.\n\nHe is still so cute.

I just I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my mother. You mean, the mom you met Montauk? She was a cat? Well, that makes the fact that she owns beachfront property all the more impressive.\n\nNo. No. No. She was a human lady. This is the Spirit of my mom, Lily, the one that killed herself.\n\nAre you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glaucoma medicine again? No doctor skip tease mode. I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. Okay.\n\nAnd for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case, which is lined with orange felt? My mother's favorite fish was orange ruffy. Cats like fish. You had me with orange felt. Hi, mommy.\n\nOh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years. Dude, Phoebe's mom's got a huge blow. Let it go. Hey. When are you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?\n\nNow? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews? No. It's not okay.

Come on.\n\nThat was back in high school. How could that still bother you? Oh, yeah. You're right, Monee Cow. Okay.\n\nI hear you. I mean, why, of all people, do you have to go out with Chip? Look. You and I went to different high schools. K.\n\nThat doesn't help me because we went to the same high school. You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off on Chip's motorcycle and wears Letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform that you had to have specially made. We had to have that specially made? Project for one of the home ec classes.\n\nOh my god. They told us that was for the mascot. Back then, I thought that I would never ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews. And now he's he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go.\n\nI I owe her this. I never let her eat. We go out with Really? Yeah. But just if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?\n\nI'll try. So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?

Joy has a very careful screening process.\n\nApparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails. Stop it. Stop it. She keeps Squirming and trying to get away just like when she was alive. So, Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?\n\nWell, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she, you know, gets used to the fact that there's, you know, a new mom. Yeah. I think she's worried that she's gonna she's gonna be replaced. Well, that's not gonna happen, is it?\n\nNo. Okay. I have to return a call in the other room. Why can't you use the phone in here?
