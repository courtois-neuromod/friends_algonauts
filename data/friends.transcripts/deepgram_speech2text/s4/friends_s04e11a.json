I can't believe my little brother's marriage. What? Why? You guys, why did you tell me you were eloping? Because it just sorta happened. You know, we were at the courthouse. We were having lunch. Wait. Wait. Why are we at the courthouse? We were having lunch. Yeah. And then all of a sudden, we were like, hey. You know, we're here. We're having lunch. Let's get married. Right? A year and a half ago, I didn't even know I had a brother. Now I have a sister too. Oh. Oh, great. Oh. Okay. Okay. Stop it. Don't. So I'm gonna get you a gift now. Is there anything you need? Yeah. We've been trying to get pregnant, pretty much ever since we got engaged. Thought that would get a jump on things. You know, no one's getting any younger. Because the thing is we, we're not able to, you know, conceive. You know? I and we've tried everything. We've seen bunch of doctors. Yeah. And they and they say that their their only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg, and put it together in a dish, And then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into. It's a really nice gift. I was thinking of, like, a gravy boat. We know. We we know it's a lot to ask. We don't have anyone else to go to. We could pay someone to do it, but we don't have that kind of money. Plus, you know, you have family and, you know, I I don't know. I just don't want my baby to grow into some chick. I don't know. We know. Don't give us an answer yet. Think about it. And, if you say no, We will totally understand. Okay. K. Oh, and, also, we were wondering if you could give us a ride down train station. Well, actually, we kinda need an answer to that one right now. Hey. You guys, check it out. Check it out.

Well, you you know what I meant. Oh, you messed up. You're stupid. So what job did you get, Joe? Oh, tour guide at the museum. Yeah. Ross got it for me. Well, how can you be a tour guide if you don't have to be a dinosaur expert or something? No. Not really. They give you all the information. It's, it's like memorizing a script. Yeah. And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period. Very nice. Yeah. Actually, Juliet's the Cretaceous period. Yeah. But I can pronounce Jurassic. Hey. Hey. Guess what? Frank Junior and Alice got married. Oh my god. And they're gonna they have a baby. Oh. And and they want me to grow it for them in my uterus. My god. Are you serious? Yeah. You're really thinking of having sex with your brother? Why? Ew. And oh, no. It's they just they want me to be the surrogate. It's her it's her egg and his sperm, and I'm I'm just the oven. Totally their bun. What did you tell them? Well, they said that I had to think about it 1st, but, what is there to think of? I'm gonna be giving someone the greatest gift you can possibly give. You're gonna carry their child and get them a Sony PlayStation? Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about. Yeah. I mean, you'd be pregnant. I mean, pregnant. I know. Babes, you're talking about putting your body through an awful A lot. I mean, morning sickness, labor, and it's all for somebody else. Yeah. What's your point? Well, the stuff I just mentioned. Wow. I don't know if I could ever do that. You know? I always figured the first time I had a baby, It would be with someone I love, and that baby was, you know, a keeper. You know, you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture. Well, Peeves, listen. If you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy. Yeah. We just want you to think it through. Yeah. Honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby, like your mom. My mom never gave birth. Oh, But my birth mom did. I love this tushy. Take it to work with him? Yeah. Sure. It's not mine anyway. Came with the pants. Oh. I am so jealous. You guys are really just right there, aren't you? Yes. Right where? Beginning where, you know, it's all sex and talking and sex and talking. Yeah. You you gotta love the talking. And the sex? Alright. We haven't had sex yet. David, what's the big deal? You know? This is special, and I want our love to grow before we move on to the next level. Chandler, that is so nice. That is really nice. Lying? No way is that the reason. Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that? No. He's right. I'm totally lying. Then what is it? Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey. And you're afraid you won't be able to Fill his shoes. No. I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him. Yeah. I was going for the metaphor. Yes. And I was saying the actual words. Well, big deal. So Joey's had a lot of girlfriends. It doesn't mean that he's great in bed. We We share a wall. So either he's great in bed or she just like to agree with him a lot. Loudly and a lot. All night long, she'd agree. Sweetie, with you, it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great because you you guys are in love. Yeah? Yeah. Just go for it, Chandler. Yeah. You should. You should. Alright. Alright. I'll sleep with my girlfriend, but I'm just doing it for you guys. Okay. Now the mastodon is from the semi late Jurassic period. Is it the mastodon for the play scene epic? This is a museum. No talking. Yeah. Right down here, we have A large foot. And over here, we have Ross Geller. Everyone wave hi to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists. Look at him hard at work. Okay. Moving right along. It's open. Come in. Hi. Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. Oh, that's okay. It gave me time to finish up blazing my nipples. Wow. Can we go all out when you're expecting company? Now I was working on my pottery. Oh. Oh. Oh, I didn't know that you did pot. Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my 2 passions, pottery and erotica. Oh. Oh, oraderie. Hey. Okay. Well, thanks for coming out to see me. I just I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. You know? I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe. Why not? Well, because you'd be giving up a baby. And I I really don't I don't know if there's anything that I could say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, oh, no. No. No. I understand the pain. Don't don't hurt the puppy. No. No. No. The the puppy is yours. Oh, I get a puppy? Well, yeah. I mean, yeah, but for only 3 days. Why? You know, I I realized that I don't have any right to start getting all parenty on you and everything now, but, Baby, would you please look at me and not the puppy? It's great for our time. Okay. I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up 2 babies, and I only wish that I had someone there who had given up babies that could have told me How terrible it is to give up babies. I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first. That's okay. Now we're listening. I just think that It would be something that you would regret every single day for the rest of your life. So however hard it is for you to give up this puppy. It would be like a 1000000 times harder to give up a child. Okay. Fair enough. 3 days. It's time to take my ass Oh, would you mind sitting there? I'm saving this seat for My friend Ross. You mean doctor Geller? Doctor? Oh, I didn't know he had a nickname. Oh, he won't sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, and only the people in the blue blazers sit over here. How how come? That's just the way it is. That's crazy. Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, But you not in a perfect world. You in a museum now. See that scientist with the glasses? He and I used to play together all the time in grade school. But now, Peter. Hey, Peter. It's me, is Rhonda from PS 129? I shared my pudding with you, man. I gave you my snack pack. See? He pretend he don't even hear me. I I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look.

I can't believe my little brother's marriage. What? Why? You guys, why did you tell me you were eloping?\n\nBecause it just sorta happened. You know, we were at the courthouse. We were having lunch. Wait. Wait.\n\nWhy are we at the courthouse? We were having lunch. Yeah. And then all of a sudden, we were like, hey. You know, we're here.\n\nWe're having lunch. Let's get married. Right? A year and a half ago, I didn't even know I had a brother. Now I have a sister too.\n\nOh. Oh, great. Oh. Okay. Okay.\n\nStop it. Don't. So I'm gonna get you a gift now. Is there anything you need? Yeah.\n\nWe've been trying to get pregnant, pretty much ever since we got engaged. Thought that would get a jump on things. You know, no one's getting any younger. Because the thing is we, we're not able to, you know, conceive. You know?\n\nI and we've tried everything. We've seen bunch of doctors. Yeah. And they and they say that their their only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg, and put it together in a dish, And then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.\n\nIt's a really nice gift. I was thinking of, like, a gravy boat. We know. We we know it's a lot to ask. We don't have anyone else to go to.\n\nWe could pay someone to do it, but we don't have that kind of money. Plus, you know, you have family and, you know, I I don't know. I just don't want my baby to grow into some chick. I don't know. We know.\n\nDon't give us an answer yet. Think about it. And, if you say no, We will totally understand. Okay. K.\n\nOh, and, also, we were wondering if you could give us a ride down train station. Well, actually, we kinda need an answer to that one right now. Hey. You guys, check it out. Check it out.\n\nGuess what job I just got? I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black. What? Blue blazer back. He he wants it back.\n\nWhy? Wait. You said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black? Well, you you know what I meant.\n\nOh, you messed up. You're stupid. So what job did you get, Joe? Oh, tour guide at the museum. Yeah.\n\nRoss got it for me. Well, how can you be a tour guide if you don't have to be a dinosaur expert or something? No. Not really. They give you all the information.\n\nIt's, it's like memorizing a script. Yeah. And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period. Very nice. Yeah.\n\nActually, Juliet's the Cretaceous period. Yeah. But I can pronounce Jurassic. Hey. Hey.\n\nGuess what? Frank Junior and Alice got married. Oh my god. And they're gonna they have a baby. Oh.\n\nAnd and they want me to grow it for them in my uterus. My god. Are you serious? Yeah.

It's her it's her egg and his sperm, and I'm I'm just the oven.\n\nTotally their bun. What did you tell them? Well, they said that I had to think about it 1st, but, what is there to think of? I'm gonna be giving someone the greatest gift you can possibly give. You're gonna carry their child and get them a Sony PlayStation?\n\nHoney, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about. Yeah. I mean, you'd be pregnant. I mean, pregnant. I know.\n\nBabes, you're talking about putting your body through an awful A lot. I mean, morning sickness, labor, and it's all for somebody else. Yeah. What's your point? Well, the stuff I just mentioned.\n\nWow. I don't know if I could ever do that. You know? I always figured the first time I had a baby, It would be with someone I love, and that baby was, you know, a keeper. You know, you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.\n\nWell, Peeves, listen. If you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy. Yeah. We just want you to think it through. Yeah.\n\nHoney, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby, like your mom. My mom never gave birth. Oh, But my birth mom did. I love this tushy. Take it to work with him?\n\nYeah. Sure. It's not mine anyway. Came with the pants. Oh.\n\nI am so jealous. You guys are really just right there, aren't you? Yes. Right where? Beginning where, you know, it's all sex and talking and sex and talking.\n\nYeah. You you gotta love the talking. And the sex? Alright. We haven't had sex yet.\n\nDavid, what's the big deal? You know? This is special, and I want our love to grow before we move on to the next level. Chandler, that is so nice. That is really nice.\n\nLying? No way is that the reason. Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that? No.\n\nHe's right. I'm totally lying. Then what is it? Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey. And you're afraid you won't be able to Fill his shoes.\n\nNo. I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him. Yeah. I was going for the metaphor. Yes.\n\nAnd I was saying the actual words. Well, big deal. So Joey's had a lot of girlfriends. It doesn't mean that he's great in bed. We We share a wall.\n\nSo either he's great in bed or she just like to agree with him a lot. Loudly and a lot. All night long, she'd agree. Sweetie, with you, it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great because you you guys are in love.\n\nYeah? Yeah. Just go for it, Chandler. Yeah. You should.\n\nYou should. Alright. Alright. I'll sleep with my girlfriend, but I'm just doing it for you guys. Okay.\n\nNow the mastodon is from the semi late Jurassic period.

I just I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. You know? I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe.\n\nWhy not?

No.\n\nNo. I understand the pain. Don't don't hurt the puppy. No. No.\n\nNo. The the puppy is yours. Oh, I get a puppy? Well, yeah. I mean, yeah, but for only 3 days.\n\nWhy? You know, I I realized that I don't have any right to start getting all parenty on you and everything now, but, Baby, would you please look at me and not the puppy? It's great for our time. Okay.

You mean doctor Geller? Doctor? Oh, I didn't know he had a nickname.\n\nOh, he won't sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, and only the people in the blue blazers sit over here. How how come? That's just the way it is. That's crazy.\n\nMaybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, But you not in a perfect world. You in a museum now. See that scientist with the glasses? He and I used to play together all the time in grade school. But now, Peter.\n\nHey, Peter. It's me, is Rhonda from PS 129? I shared my pudding with you, man. I gave you my snack pack. See?\n\nHe pretend he don't even hear me. I I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look.
