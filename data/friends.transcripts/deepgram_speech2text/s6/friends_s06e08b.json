He said, Rachel, I can't Do this even though you are a very, very, very beautiful woman. I can't do this. I'm married, and I'm sorry. And then I don't know why, but he said, and you will never get promoted, especially not above Kim who was an integral Cog in the Ralph Lauren machine. You expect me to believe hi, Ralph. Kim? Oh my god. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen it's like he hates you. Then it is true. Of course, it's true, and it hurts so Ed. Oh, honey. Come here. Oh, it'll be okay.

You know what?\n\nI'm I'm gonna I'm gonna go over to Joey's. Wait. We're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer. Yes. But I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today.\n\nYou know? In fact, I think we're 2 sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple. You know what? This has been kind of a girly day. You're right.\n\nI'm sorry. No. No. It's okay. I just I I feel like I need to be in a guy place, you know, do kind of a, like, a man thing.\n\nYeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall. You know when guys hang out, they don't just drink beer and hammer up drywall. When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear.\n\nI'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that. Hey, Chandler.\n\nCome on in. We're knitting pot holders. No. Thanks, Josephine. Hey, Ross.\n\nI was wondering if Oh my god. Where are all the men? Oh, hi, Kim. Hi, Rachel. Yeah.\n\nRemember that thing I told you that happened yesterday?

Well, it turns out that's not true. That's not true. Oh, that's interesting. Because I checked, and only one key card was used to access the coffee machine yesterday during lunch, and that key card belonged to you, Rachel.\n\nOh, no. No. No. No. Oh, god.\n\nYou think I out with him. Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is gonna get you my job, you are sadly mistaken. Oh, no. No.\n\nI don't I don't I Watch your job. I don't. I oh, this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him.\n\nI did not use my key card yesterday. I don't even know how to use my key Hi, Ralph. Hi, Kim. Yeah. Nothing happened.\n\nYou could cut the sexual tension in with a knife. And after that, what could I do Seth become a chef. Mhmm. And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant. You know, You're a really great listener.\n\nMost guys I go out with, they just talk and talk. After a while, it's just like Shut your mouth. You know? I've probably been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you a little Come on.\n\nI wanna know. Okay. I, I'm from Long Island. I, came to the city for college. I, I have a a 5 year old son, And I in my spare time, I I like to read spy novels.\n\nBut but let's talk more about you. So what's really neat is if you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer. Joey, that is such a Great tip. Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.\n\nOkay. Oh, but, Joey, come over later because I'm gonna teach you how to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter. Aw. I love birds. What is the matter with you?\n\nWhat?

So now she thinks that I made out with him and that I did it to get her job. But why didn't you just tell her the truth? I did, but she doesn't think that anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the coffee guy With Ralph Lauren.\n\nHey. What if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know? What if what if what if Kenny that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man. Did she ever think of that?\n\nYou were with Kenny today, weren't you? Just for a sec. Oh, Phoebe, what am I gonna do? Well, The only thing you can do is sleep with Ralph Lauren. I I'm not gonna sleep with Ralph Lauren.\n\nI mean, I could, but I wouldn't. Oh, sleep with Kenny. That wouldn't help me. Oh, yes. It would.\n\nI've had a really good time tonight. Mhmm. You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the 1st date. Me neither. I I've had a really good time too.\n\nYou know? Are you gonna eat that bread? Oh, I I I just like the smell. You make me laugh. Would you like to move over to the couch?\n\nMhmm. Maybe I'll just turn down the lights a little. How about all the way? Wow. Cool poster, Or should I say groovy poster?\n\nSo, Where were we? Are those your teeth? Oh, you you can see them. Yes. They're insanely white.\n\nI I did that for you. What's the matter with you? What's the matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1990 Hi.\n\nOh, Good. Kim, hi. Hi, Rachel. Oh, I've been meaning to ask you.

Ralph and I were an item, We're not anymore. Oh, really? Yep.\n\nHe dumped me. He said, Rachel, I can't Do this even though you are a very, very, very beautiful woman. I can't do this. I'm married, and I'm sorry. And then I don't know why, but he said, and you will never get promoted, especially not above Kim who was an integral Cog in the Ralph Lauren machine.\n\nYou expect me to believe hi, Ralph. Kim? Oh my god. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen it's like he hates you. Then it is true.\n\nOf course, it's true, and it hurts so Ed. Oh, honey. Come here. Oh, it'll be okay. We've all in there.\n\nYou were you and Ralph? Kenny, the A copy boy. Hey. Hey. I need to talk to you.\n\nWhat's the matter? You upset? Would you like me to get a pint of ice cream and 2 spoons? No. No.\n\nNo. No. No. No ice cream. Look.\n\nI'm sorry, but we gotta get rid of all this girly stuff in here. I, I gotta be a man. Okay? The living room has to remain a guy place. Okay?\n\nJust the way it has to be. Oh, if that's what you want, I'll just put it all in my room. Good. Great. Oh, great.\n\nAnd, hey. Thanks for, being so understanding. I mean, I didn't wanna make a a big deal out of this. You know? But well, but you could, put the picture of the famous baby in my room.\n\nI mean, if you want to. Okay.
