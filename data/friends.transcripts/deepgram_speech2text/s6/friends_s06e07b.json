Oh, come on. Come on. It can't be that bad. It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I might even try to get out of here early. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. It sounds like, they really need you down there. Alright. You're just hanging out with Ross? It's all good. Okay. Bye bye. She's gonna kill me. Well, the phone is facing the other way, and that goes back up there. Okay. This is good. This is under control. You know what we should do? We should start with the big stuff. You know? That'll be the easiest. So, let's start with the couch. I got it. Yeah. That that doesn't look right. What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet, and then I could just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on okay. Okay. Here's what we do. We just, move the couch closer to the coffee table. Oh, but then the back of the couch won't line up with the back of the carpet. Okay. Well, here. We'll just, we'll move the coffee table closer to the couch. No. Woah. Woah. Woah. But then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area. Just for the coffee dinner, it doesn't match. It's too much. Hi. Look. What am I gonna do? I'm not flirting, but still, I'm I'm I'm drawing her to me like like like a moth to a flame. What the hell is going on over here? Monica's gonna kill you. Look. I need your help. Okay? I have to do something to to repel this woman. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You guys repel women all the time. Hey. I've been married 3 times. No. No. No. No. No. No. I've seen it happen. You you you get a rapport going with a woman, but somehow you managed to kill it time after time after Time after time. What's your secret? Look. We do not repel women. Okay? That is Completely untrue. Oh, no. Yes. We do, my man. Remember when we were back in college, we went to that spring dance, and you walked right after that girl you liked, and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine. Yeah. Yeah. Well, what about you? You weren't so, you know, hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go. Yeah. Monica doesn't like that either. Maybe I should stop doing that. Well, you know what? Girls don't like it when when I start talking about science. That's not specific to girls. This is great. This is great. What what else? What else? Oh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar. And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny. You know, they don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you. Man, I am so lucky I have Monica. I'm never gonna find love again. Hey. Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second? Sure. Okay. I Phoebe, look. I just wanted to say that I'm Sorry. Okay? I handled the situation horribly, and and I should not have lied to you. So what should you have done? Well, I I should have told you the truth. Which is? Well, You know, the reason that I didn't wanna go running with you is because, well, you know, the way that you run is just a little So? Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy. Why do you care? Because they're people. But people that you don't know and will never sing again. Yes. But still, they are people with eyes. Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to miss. But oh, okay. No. No. I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah. Okay. You're uptight. I I am not uptight. Listen. I am not Uptight, man. That's okay, Rachel. I'm not judging you. That's just who you are. Me, I'm more free. You know? I run like I did when I was a kid because it's the only way it's fun. You know? I mean, didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off, you know, like, when you were, like, running toward the swings or or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog. Okay. Is this lamp in the place. Who cares? I repel women. Do it. No. No. No. You can't come here. Ross is naked. What? What? I couldn't say why I was naked because she's allowed to see me naked. Why does anyone have to be naked Why is Ross naked? I I had to show Chandler something. Naked? Yeah. I I, I guess I have a, a guy problem. Is it the same thing that Chandler had? Look. Just just come back later. We'll get everything squared away, and you can come back later. Okay. Hey. Listen. There's still some of Chandler's medicine left under the sink in the bathroom. Bye. Bye. Thank god. Dude, what'd you have? Look. We have no time. Okay. We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place. The photo album. There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go Threw it and match everything to the pictures. That's perfect. That's brilliant. So, really, what'd you have? Hey, Joey. Got some beer for you. Don't don't you mean for whom? Sure. Listen. I was gonna order some pizza. You wanna share 1? Pizza. It's not like I never had that before, but I'm bummed. Is there something wrong? Yeah. I'm depressed about that Irish potato famine. No. I mean, with me because you seem to be acting really weird around me. Alright. Alright. Let let let's just get this out in the open. Okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly, there's a vibe going on between us, but We're roommates, and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road. Joe No. No. No. I'm telling you. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket, and you will understand. Okay? So the question is, What do we do? Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean, I I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that. Oh. No. I mean, you're a really nice guy, and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend. I'm just, You know, I just don't feel that way about you. Oh, I see what happens. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me. You'd feel a lot different if I turned it on. I didn't think so. Oh, I do. How you doing? I'm okay. What? What? Oh, dear god. I'm so sorry. You're right. This feels great. See? And you don't care if people are staring. It's just for a second because then you're fine. You're fine. I mean, it's amazing things. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey. Watch out for the horse. Is it okay for me to come in now? Uh-huh. Why is everything different? Bye. Well, I don't I don't I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. It probably. End table is wrong. The couch looks bizarre, and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets. Okay. Well, don't don't be mad. Okay? But after I unpack the boxes, I wanna do something nice for you. So I I I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around, and then I I forgot where it Where it went back, and I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something? Do you want me to be afraid of you? Oh, gosh. Not. My gosh. Chandler, what you did, it's a wonderful thing, and I I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I would never expect you to worry about that. Really? Of course. Oh, you're the best. You come here to me. Alright. Hold on. Okay? Thank you. 1st thing's first. Okay. Now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked? So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So, theoretically, you could download your thoughts And your memories into this computer And live forever as a machine. So, Deneen, do you you know what you know what we're doing right now? You and I, we're we're interfacing. Yeah.

Oh, come on. Come on. It can't be that bad. It's worse.\n\nThe only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I might even try to get out of here early. No. No. No.\n\nNo. No. No. No. No.\n\nNo. It sounds like, they really need you down there. Alright. You're just hanging out with Ross? It's all good.\n\nOkay. Bye bye. She's gonna kill me. Well, the phone is facing the other way, and that goes back up there. Okay.\n\nThis is good. This is under control. You know what we should do? We should start with the big stuff. You know?\n\nThat'll be the easiest. So, let's start with the couch. I got it. Yeah. That that doesn't look right.\n\nWhat are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet, and then I could just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on okay. Okay. Here's what we do. We just, move the couch closer to the coffee table.\n\nOh, but then the back of the couch won't line up with the back of the carpet. Okay. Well, here. We'll just, we'll move the coffee table closer to the couch. No.\n\nWoah. Woah. Woah. But then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area. Just for the coffee dinner, it doesn't match.\n\nIt's too much. Hi. Look. What am I gonna do? I'm not flirting, but still, I'm I'm I'm drawing her to me like like like a moth to a flame.\n\nWhat the hell is going on over here? Monica's gonna kill you. Look. I need your help. Okay?\n\nI have to do something to to repel this woman. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You guys repel women all the time. Hey.\n\nI've been married 3 times. No. No. No. No.\n\nNo. No. I've seen it happen. You you you get a rapport going with a woman, but somehow you managed to kill it time after time after Time after time. What's your secret?\n\nLook. We do not repel women. Okay? That is Completely untrue. Oh, no.\n\nYes. We do, my man. Remember when we were back in college, we went to that spring dance, and you walked right after that girl you liked, and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nWell, what about you? You weren't so, you know, hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go. Yeah. Monica doesn't like that either.\n\nMaybe I should stop doing that. Well, you know what? Girls don't like it when when I start talking about science. That's not specific to girls. This is great.\n\nThis is great. What what else? What else? Oh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar. And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.\n\nYou know, they don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you. Man, I am so lucky I have Monica. I'm never gonna find love again. Hey. Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?\n\nSure. Okay. I Phoebe, look. I just wanted to say that I'm Sorry. Okay?\n\nI handled the situation horribly, and and I should not have lied to you. So what should you have done? Well, I I should have told you the truth. Which is? Well, You know, the reason that I didn't wanna go running with you is because, well, you know, the way that you run is just a little So?\n\nWell, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy. Why do you care? Because they're people. But people that you don't know and will never sing again.\n\nYes. But still, they are people with eyes. Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to miss. But oh, okay. No.\n\nNo. I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah. Okay. You're uptight.\n\nI I am not uptight. Listen. I am not Uptight, man. That's okay, Rachel. I'm not judging you.\n\nThat's just who you are. Me, I'm more free. You know? I run like I did when I was a kid because it's the only way it's fun. You know?\n\nI mean, didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off, you know, like, when you were, like, running toward the swings or or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog. Okay. Is this lamp in the place. Who cares?\n\nI repel women. Do it. No. No. No.\n\nYou can't come here. Ross is naked. What? What? I couldn't say why I was naked because she's allowed to see me naked.\n\nWhy does anyone have to be naked Why is Ross naked? I I had to show Chandler something. Naked? Yeah. I I, I guess I have a, a guy problem.\n\nIs it the same thing that Chandler had? Look. Just just come back later. We'll get everything squared away, and you can come back later. Okay.\n\nHey. Listen. There's still some of Chandler's medicine left under the sink in the bathroom. Bye. Bye.\n\nThank god. Dude, what'd you have? Look. We have no time. Okay.\n\nWe must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place. The photo album. There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go Threw it and match everything to the pictures.\n\nThat's perfect. That's brilliant. So, really, what'd you have? Hey, Joey. Got some beer for you.\n\nDon't don't you mean for whom? Sure. Listen. I was gonna order some pizza. You wanna share 1?\n\nPizza. It's not like I never had that before, but I'm bummed. Is there something wrong? Yeah. I'm depressed about that Irish potato famine.\n\nNo. I mean, with me because you seem to be acting really weird around me. Alright. Alright. Let let let's just get this out in the open.\n\nOkay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly, there's a vibe going on between us, but We're roommates, and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road. Joe No.\n\nNo. No. I'm telling you. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket, and you will understand. Okay?\n\nSo the question is, What do we do? Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean, I I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that. Oh. No.\n\nI mean, you're a really nice guy, and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend. I'm just, You know, I just don't feel that way about you. Oh, I see what happens. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right?\n\nBelieve me. You'd feel a lot different if I turned it on. I didn't think so. Oh, I do. How you doing?\n\nI'm okay. What? What? Oh, dear god. I'm so sorry.\n\nYou're right. This feels great. See? And you don't care if people are staring. It's just for a second because then you're fine.\n\nYou're fine. I mean, it's amazing things. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey. Watch out for the horse.\n\nIs it okay for me to come in now? Uh-huh. Why is everything different? Bye. Well, I don't I don't I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.\n\nIt probably.
