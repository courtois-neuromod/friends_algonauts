Oh, wake up, Chandler.\n\nThe one you picked is gone. It's over. What? Some guy bought it. I'm sorry.\n\nI tried to stop it, but they put me in jail. They put you in jail? The little Jay on between the doors. Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring. I know.\n\nI'm sorry. But, you know, this ring is better, Monica never even saw the other ring. Yeah. But when he proposed to me with the ring, I got goosebumps. Maybe it was the guy.\n\nIt was the ring. Hey. So, was he excited about the tickets? No. He blew us off.\n\nWhat? I know. Can't believe it. Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.\n\nMay I tell you something? Me too. You know what? He didn't wanna talk to us about being angry, Or maybe we don't talk to him at all. Oh, freeze him out.\n\nThat's right. I like it. Yeah? We'll show him. From now on, It's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends.\n\nOkay. We're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler. What? Woah.

No.\n\nWhatever happened to that many dude. So full of dreams. I don't care about the little dude. I can't. I cannot listen to any more of this.\n\nYou know the only person who would wanna listen to this is a mental health professional, and that is only because they get paid $100 an hour. Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000. And you know what? I figured that out while you were talking.\n\nI I can't believe you're trying to stifle me when just 14 hours ago, we figured out that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me. I'm sorry. I I I don't mean I didn't mean to stifle you. This is all just a little overwhelming. Oh, Rachel.\n\nHi. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that when those gates open, it's hard Hard to close them, but they are closed now. Believe me.\n\nI'm so glad. I'm so glad You shared, and I'm glad that you're done. So what do you say we I really like that. That was So good. Oh.\n\nOh. Hey. I can't believe I let you talk me into buying the Stupid gumball machine looking ring. It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring. It's a beautiful ring.\n\nNo. It's not. When I looked at the other ring, I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her. You know? And I could see her saying yes.\n\nWhen I look at this ring, all I see is a ring. Unless I look at it really closely, and then I can see my own eye. Look. This is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.\n\nOkay. There may be a way that we could get the other ring back because I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was gonna propose. So maybe we could get him to trade rings or something. Can't do that. Well, you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.\n\nAlright. Where was he going? Yeah. It's a restaurant. It's the rainbow something.\n\nRainbow room? Yep. Rainbow grill? Yep. Somewhere over the Laplace.\n\nRainbow Laplace. No. No. Just Laplace. Would love to know how you got from Rainbow to La Paz.\n\nNo. You wouldn't. You don't wanna get in here. There he is. Okay.\n\nAnd he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger. Wow. You're good. After this, we should solve crimes. Yeah.\n\nOkay. Go go go get him. Oh, okay. Excuse me, sir. Could you come with me, please?\n\nYou have a phone call. Who is it? It is your office. Do you know who went my office? John.\n\nOh, John. Great. Hi. Hi. Okay.\n\nThere was a slight mix up at the jewelry store. The ring you're about to propose with was Supposed to be held for me, so I'm gonna need to have that back. But in exchange, I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Wow. I would trade.\n\nIt is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one. Now if you'll excuse me. No. No. See, this is my fiance, and her heart was set on that ring.\n\nYou don't wanna break her heart now, do you? Yeah. Do you wanna break a dying woman's heart? You're dying? Yeah.\n\nShe's dying of a cough, apparently. Yes. And it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring, then my spirit is going to wander the netherworld for all Okay. That's enough money.\n\nI don't know. Alright. Let me see the ring. Great. Okay.\n\nHere. Alright. I'll do it. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nThank you. And you are about to marry a wonderful man. Hey.

And you should know.\n\nYou've bought, like, a 1000000000 of them. Humor based on my pain. Hey. You know what's funny? Of all of your wives, I'm the only one who never got a ring.\n\nThis, big issue for you? No. But it, you know, would have been nice to have a little memento of our married time together. Something other than the divorce papers and the hangover. Ross is obviously not gonna get you a ring, But ask for a musket.\n\nAsk for a musket. Hey. When we were married, do you know what I never got? Sex.
