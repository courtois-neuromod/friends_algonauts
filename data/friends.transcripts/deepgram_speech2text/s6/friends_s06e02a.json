That was my scariest voice. You're very brave. Hey. Hey. Ugh. The worst day. You know, you think you're finally making progress at work, and then your boss calls you Raquel. Hey. Listen. For the 1st 4 years of my work, everybody called me. Seriously? I believe you. So it was right in the middle of a Staff meeting. So, of course, no one else wants to correct her, so everyone else is calling me Raquel. By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky.

We'll be waiting for you. See? Once you know the stories, it's not that bad. 1st marriage, wife's Hidden sexuality, not my fault. 2nd marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. 3rd marriage, well, they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face. Nevada's fault. Okay. So what do you think, ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't wanna date him? Well, the divorces don't bother me. I'd date him, but not while he's still married. Okay. What about you? Wouldn't you wanna date actually, I'm not dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were, you know, like, bad for me. So I decided that until I could work that out, those demons Whatever. What about you, Meg? Well, I don't care about the divorces either, but I wouldn't date him. Normally, he doesn't sweat this much. It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl. What? She said he's obviously still in love with it. This is crazy. I mean, yes yes.

I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be 4 divorce guy, murderer guy, and and Geologist. Ross, you're being ridiculous.\n\nOkay? You are cute and smart and sweet, and that is much more important than three Stupid divorces. Oh, yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who's been divorced 3 times?

I just gotta tell her I have to get it over with. I've told Ross and Phoebe, and she's the only one left.\n\nOkay. That's it. So everybody knows. It's official. We're moving in together.\n\nNo turning back. Are you scared? Are you? No. Wow.\n\nThat was my scariest voice. You're very brave. Hey. Hey. Ugh.\n\nThe worst day. You know, you think you're finally making progress at work, and then your boss calls you Raquel. Hey. Listen. For the 1st 4 years of my work, everybody called me.\n\nSeriously? I believe you. So it was right in the middle of a Staff meeting. So, of course, no one else wants to correct her, so everyone else is calling me Raquel.

We'll be waiting for you.\n\nSee? Once you know the stories, it's not that bad. 1st marriage, wife's Hidden sexuality, not my fault. 2nd marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. 3rd marriage, well, they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face.\n\nNevada's fault. Okay. So what do you think, ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't wanna date him?\n\nWell, the divorces don't bother me. I'd date him, but not while he's still married. Okay. What about you? Wouldn't you wanna date actually, I'm not dating at all anymore.\n\nSee, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were, you know, like, bad for me. So I decided that until I could work that out, those demons Whatever. What about you, Meg? Well, I don't care about the divorces either, but I wouldn't date him. Normally, he doesn't sweat this much.\n\nIt's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl. What? She said he's obviously still in love with it. This is crazy. I mean, yes yes.\n\nRachel is my good friend, and I I have loved her in the past, but now she is just my wife.", "paragraphs": [{"sentences": [{"text": "Hey.", "start": 3.12, "end": 3.62}, {"text":
