Hi. Hey. What's the matter? Well, it's just it's one of these situations that I just hate. You know, a massage client gave me 3 tickets to the helmet pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase Museum. Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him. No. No. It's just that he gave me 3 tickets, and there are 6 of us. Don't give up my ticket. Me too. Okay. That's so generous. And I think Ross is generous too. Great. Okay. Then it's just us girls. Great. Yeah. So what what is the exhibit? It's mostly just photographs of, lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches. Oh, man. Hey. Hi there. Hey. Hey. Ross. Listen. Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend. Thanks, but I have plans. Elizabeth and I are going out of town. Oh, that's great. Yeah. I mean, think about all the money that you're gonna make. Why? What? Well, her father pays you for babysitting. Right? Oh, no. No. No. That's funny, but maybe it's time to move on. You know? Let it go. Stop it. Besides, Rachel's going out with Elizabeth's father, so, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils. Ross, all that does is remind that you are interested in fossils. Okay. Okay. Well, Rachel's gonna need to yell, sweet nothing's in his ear. Boss. Oh, come on, you guys. That's Funny. You know? Because he's gonna need he's got, like, a hearing aid, you know, because because because he's all old. K. Look, Ross. Just so you know, since Lizzie likes you so much, decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her. Really? That okay. That's Great. Yeah. But then I changed my mind. Funny like that. So I told Lizzie. Now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore. Alright. Look. I I realize it upsets you. Yes. It does. But Elizabeth and I are are both adults, and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it. I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired. Oh, a man with a plan. Oh, this is so exciting. It's great. You get your picture back up on the wall of fame. I know. He's got All the big actors. Yeah. He was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi just be cracking up about something. Then I get fired up days of our lives, and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him. That smug Belushi bastard. Oh, Okay. Maybe when they put your picture back up, they could put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him just smiling at me. Yeah. I know. We'd be great together. Oh, just talk. Hey. So I'm back. Who are you? Joey Tribbiani from The Wall. Okay. Maybe this will jog your memory. Okay. Anyway, I'm ready to go back Up on the wall on the star of a new TV show. Show me in the TV book.

Hi. Hey. What's the matter? Well, it's just it's one of these situations that I just hate.\n\nYou know, a massage client gave me 3 tickets to the helmet pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase Museum. Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him. No. No. It's just that he gave me 3 tickets, and there are 6 of us.\n\nDon't give up my ticket. Me too. Okay. That's so generous. And I think Ross is generous too.\n\nGreat. Okay. Then it's just us girls. Great. Yeah.\n\nSo what what is the exhibit? It's mostly just photographs of, lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches. Oh, man. Hey. Hi there.\n\nHey. Hey. Ross. Listen. Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend.\n\nThanks, but I have plans. Elizabeth and I are going out of town. Oh, that's great. Yeah. I mean, think about all the money that you're gonna make.\n\nWhy? What? Well, her father pays you for babysitting. Right? Oh, no.\n\nNo. No. That's funny, but maybe it's time to move on. You know? Let it go.\n\nStop it. Besides, Rachel's going out with Elizabeth's father, so, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils. Ross, all that does is remind that you are interested in fossils. Okay.\n\nOkay. Well, Rachel's gonna need to yell, sweet nothing's in his ear. Boss. Oh, come on, you guys. That's Funny.\n\nYou know? Because he's gonna need he's got, like, a hearing aid, you know, because because because he's all old. K. Look, Ross. Just so you know, since Lizzie likes you so much, decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.\n\nReally? That okay. That's Great. Yeah. But then I changed my mind.\n\nFunny like that. So I told Lizzie. Now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore. Alright. Look.\n\nI I realize it upsets you. Yes. It does. But Elizabeth and I are are both adults, and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it. I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.\n\nOh, a man with a plan. Oh, this is so exciting. It's great. You get your picture back up on the wall of fame. I know.\n\nHe's got All the big actors. Yeah. He was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi just be cracking up about something. Then I get fired up days of our lives, and he takes me down.\n\nNow he's just laughing at me. Look at him. That smug Belushi bastard. Oh, Okay. Maybe when they put your picture back up, they could put you next to Matt Lauer.\n\nLook at him just smiling at me. Yeah. I know. We'd be great together. Oh, just talk.\n\nHey. So I'm back. Who are you? Joey Tribbiani from The Wall. Okay.\n\nMaybe this will jog your memory. Okay. Anyway, I'm ready to go back Up on the wall on the star of a new TV show. Show me in the TV book. Oh, well, it's not on TV yet.\n\nWell, then it's not on the wall yet. Okay. Fine. I will bring you a tape. So, now Do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here, maybe?\n\nJust the ones that haven't been cleaned yet? Good. I love museums. Mhmm. Soaking up all the culture.\n\nYeah. Where Where do you wanna start? Oh, the gift shop. Yeah. Wait.\n\nAnd then lunch. Uh-huh. Oh, wait. Yes. But I can't eat too much.\n\nPaul's taking me out to dinner tonight. He said he has a big surprise plan. Oh, wow. But do you think maybe he's gonna tell you he's gay? What?\n\nNo. Why? No reason. That would just be a really big surprise. Right?\n\nWell, you could put the aisle over here and then have the wedding ceremony right over here. I didn't know you could get married here. Mhmm. This would be a beautiful place to get married. Yeah.\n\nYeah. But I wouldn't even put the aisle there, and I would never have the Ceremony there, and you'd you'd have the ceremony under this big, beautiful arch. May I help you? Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.\n\nJust such a beautiful space. Do you do a lot of weddings here? Yes. We're very popular. There's a 2 year waiting list.\n\nSorry. Monica, you should totally put your name down for this place. What? Are you crazy? I'm like getting married.\n\nI'm I'm not even engaged. No. There's a 2 year wait. And then what if you get engaged in 2 years, and then you've gotta wait another 2 years for this place? That's 4 years.\n\nTamara's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else. You know? Someone someone who did put their name on the list. Mhmm.\n\nYeah. I know it can't hurt to put your name down. If in 2 years, you're not engaged, you just don't use it. Well, I mean, I guess there is no harm in putting my name down. I'm gonna do it too.\n\nMe too. Really? Who who would you marry? I don't know. I don't have anyone right now.\n\nYou know? Oh, Eebes. Don't Feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay. Phoebe, that's not really Don't even get me started on yours.\n\nHey. So did you watch the tape of my show? I did. Alright. Let's Get me back up there.\n\nNo. You don't go up on the wall. What? But you saw the show? Yes.\n\nIt was very offensive to my people. Dry cleaners? Russians. You'd show them as terrorists and villains. Okay.\n\nOkay. Look. You you you you got Harrison Ford up there. That's right. Mister Ford is a very good customer.\n\nHe brings us a lot of claws. You bring us nothing. Okay. Well, that may be true. But in in air force one, okay, the Russians were terrorists And evil.\n\nAnd plus he kills a bunch of them. Now that that's offensive to Russians.
