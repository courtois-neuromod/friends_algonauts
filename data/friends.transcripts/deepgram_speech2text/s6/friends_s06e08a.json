You blasted all? Yay. Good for you. But, dude, you you could still use the copy machine where I actually work, but just come by at lunch so that my boss doesn't see you because Kim will just freak out, and she already doesn't like me very much. That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either. I don't think mine likes me either. Maybe it's a universal thing. Yeah. Or maybe it's because you're all hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday. Yeah. Let's head off to work. Thank you. Shiloh.

Look, Janine, I I really want you to feel at home here, but Some of this new stuff, it's just it's too girly. Oh, like what? Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. You can't have that. Joey, it's Angie. She's a famous artist. Look. I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. And I don't wanna be a jerk, but you you're changing too much around here. I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try and make the place a little nicer. Yeah. But it's it's too much stuff. You know? Like, you got the candles and the the foofy Schmoofer thing here. And over here, you got a picture of a watering can. Well, I just thought. I'm sure It's a famous watering can. Okay. Come on. And what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom? It's a curling iron. Well, that's okay then. But okay. My towels, for instance. Okay? I come into the bathroom here, and my towel is not on the floor where I keep it. Up here on some hook, and smells different. It's clean. Yeah. Well, it it feels different. It's Brian. Alright. I can make my piece with the clean, dry towels. And, okay, also, Sean.

So here, Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in Coffee Room. Tell me everything. Hey, guys. Hey. What's up? You know, oh my god. What happened to your teeth? I whiten them. Really? Yeah. What what do you think? Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them. Come on. Seriously. Why is it really, really, really white? Yeah. What was wrong with your old human teeth? I I did leave the gel on a little longer than it said to. How much longer? A a day. Josh. You know that tonight is your date with Hillary. I know. That's why I did it. Come on. Are they really that bad? No. No. No. No. You'll you'll be fine. Hillary's blind. Right? She will be after tonight. Oh, hey. Hey, Rich. Do you notice anything? Your teeth? Yes. I saw them from outside. You guys are never gonna believe this, but Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. My wife? Good. Yeah. I know she ran into him at my this, and they just made out. And the craziest thing is now my boss likes me because I told her about it, and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year. I am proud of all my friends today. Rachel, I can't believe BB made out with Ralph Lauren. I'm so jealous. Hi. I'm Chandler, your live in boyfriend. Chandler, please. Come on. Look at him. Well, I am no woman, but that is one tasty dish. Charlie. I'm here. Oh, who's the silver fox? That is your make out buddy. Don't you recognize him? Oh, wait. Oh, Phoebe, I love you. Kiss me, please. That's not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him, though. What? Yeah. No. Ralph's doesn't look anything like that guy. He's he's young, and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack. Oh my god. Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the coffee guy. What? Oh, and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her. She is gonna hate me even more. Phoebe, why would the coffee guy say that he's Ralph Lauren? To get you to make Out with him. Oh, Make your teeth look less white. Nope. No? Okay. So, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple. Do you wanna try this highlighter Ken. No. I think it poisoned me a little. The date starts in, like, an hour. What am I gonna do? Hey.

What is it's like a guy never lived in here. Look.\n\nYou gotta be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already. It is? Yeah.\n\nIs this your pretty pink pillow on the couch? I don't know. Is that your tiny little box that's too small to put anything in? No. No.\n\nOkay. This is not good. You are a guy. Okay? This is a guy's place.\n\nIf you let this go, you're gonna be sitting around with your fingers soaking and stuff, and your head's gonna be under a big round drying big drying rads. Not good. Alright.

Yeah.\n\nThe one that always stares at me when I come in? But, no, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way. Still, I could tell. She was into me. Chuck.\n\nWhy don't you set us up? Oh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress? Come on, Monica. I'm serious.\n\nOkay. I'll do it. But as long as you promise you won't marry her. Fine.

But, dude, you you could still use the copy machine where I actually work, but just come by at lunch so that my boss doesn't see you because Kim will just freak out, and she already doesn't like me very much. That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either. I don't think mine likes me either.\n\nMaybe it's a universal thing. Yeah. Or maybe it's because you're all hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday. Yeah. Let's head off to work.\n\nThank you. Shiloh. Now you will not believe this, but I was in the copy room making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in. Oh my god. Did you talk to him?\n\nYeah. A little. He seems really nice. Good kisser. What?\n\nWhat? You kissed him? Totally. Phoebe, are you serious? Yeah.\n\nI was just in there. He came in. He introduced himself, and then next thing I know, we're make out. You know? Phoebe, I mean, you do know he's married.\n\nNo. Phoebe, what am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No. Yeah.\n\nI should. Hey, Joey. Hey. Can I talk to you for a second? There's a kid in this picture.\n\nDo you, you know this kid? Is that, like, a relative or something? Well, I just thought it was cute. Yeah. That's what I was afraid of.\n\nOkay. Look, Janine, I I really want you to feel at home here, but Some of this new stuff, it's just it's too girly. Oh, like what? Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know.\n\nYou can't have that. Joey, it's Angie. She's a famous artist. Look. I don't know this baby.\n\nI don't know if she's a famous artist or not. And I don't wanna be a jerk, but you you're changing too much around here. I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try and make the place a little nicer. Yeah.\n\nBut it's it's too much stuff. You know? Like, you got the candles and the the foofy Schmoofer thing here. And over here, you got a picture of a watering can. Well, I just thought.\n\nI'm sure It's a famous watering can. Okay. Come on. And what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom? It's a curling iron.\n\nWell, that's okay then. But okay. My towels, for instance. Okay? I come into the bathroom here, and my towel is not on the floor where I keep it.\n\nUp here on some hook, and smells different. It's clean. Yeah. Well, it it feels different. It's Brian.\n\nAlright. I can make my piece with the clean, dry towels. And, okay, also, Sean. What is with these chips you bought? I don't No.\n\nNo. No. It's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it. Well, that's like somewhere in a ball.\n\nOh, Kim. Hi. Uh-huh. So, you know, I I I handed in that marketing report, and I and I never got to hear what you thought. I didn't read it.\n\nDrew. So, wow, the spring line, it's really gonna be great this year. Yeah. So here, Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in Coffee Room. Tell me everything.\n\nHey, guys. Hey. What's up? You know, oh my god. What happened to your teeth?\n\nI whiten them. Really? Yeah. What what do you think? Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.\n\nCome on. Seriously. Why is it really, really, really white? Yeah. What was wrong with your old human teeth?\n\nI I did leave the gel on a little longer than it said to. How much longer? A a day. Josh. You know that tonight is your date with Hillary.\n\nI know. That's why I did it. Come on. Are they really that bad? No.\n\nNo. No. No. You'll you'll be fine. Hillary's blind.\n\nRight? She will be after tonight. Oh, hey. Hey, Rich. Do you notice anything?\n\nYour teeth? Yes. I saw them from outside. You guys are never gonna believe this, but Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. My wife?\n\nGood. Yeah. I know she ran into him at my this, and they just made out. And the craziest thing is now my boss likes me because I told her about it, and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year. I am proud of all my friends today.\n\nRachel, I can't believe BB made out with Ralph Lauren. I'm so jealous. Hi. I'm Chandler, your live in boyfriend. Chandler, please.\n\nCome on. Look at him. Well, I am no woman, but that is one tasty dish. Charlie. I'm here.\n\nOh, who's the silver fox? That is your make out buddy. Don't you recognize him? Oh, wait. Oh, Phoebe, I love you.\n\nKiss me, please. That's not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him, though. What? Yeah.\n\nNo. Ralph's doesn't look anything like that guy. He's he's young, and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack. Oh my god. Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren.\n\nThat's Kenny the coffee guy. What? Oh, and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her. She is gonna hate me even more.\n\nPhoebe, why would the coffee guy say that he's Ralph Lauren? To get you to make Out with him. Oh, Make your teeth look less white. Nope. No?\n\nOkay. So, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple. Do you wanna try this highlighter Ken. No. I think it poisoned me a little.\n\nThe date starts in, like, an hour. What am I gonna do? Hey.
