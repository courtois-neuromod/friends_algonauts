Why is everybody using these tiny little lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights. That's a good story, grandpa. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wow. Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree. Did someone get her drunk again? Or Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love. That is nice, and we're done. Tada. I don't know what it is. Just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me. Oh, yes. See, now it feels like Christmas. And that's the story of the dreidel. Now some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the Shortest day of the year symbolizing life's triumph over death. Now that was, like, 4000 years ago. So pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story. Hey, you guys. Hey, Joe. It's me. I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is, like, stretching all over the place. You know? Everywhere I look, she's like I can see why that's hard to resist. I like her so much. Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie, that she doesn't feel the same way. I know. She's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair. You are aware that she's not a monkey. Right? I am so over Janine. I mean, I, yeah. At first, I thought she was hot, but now she's like old news. Hey, guys. Janine. I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve.

But she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey. I'm I'm sorry, but I don't think that that was a romantic thing. Maybe. But, hey. I know how I can find out. Well, we're going on a New Year's Eve party. Right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And she kisses me back, great. You know? And and she says, dude, what the hell are you doing?

ask you. Why is everybody using these tiny little lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights. That's a good story, grandpa. Hey.\n\nHey. Hey. Wow. Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree. Did someone get her drunk again?\n\nOr Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love. That is nice, and we're done. Tada. I don't know what it is.\n\nJust doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me. Oh, yes. See, now it feels like Christmas. And that's the story of the dreidel. Now some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the Shortest day of the year symbolizing life's triumph over death.\n\nNow that was, like, 4000 years ago. So pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story. Hey, you guys. Hey, Joe. It's me.\n\nI had to get out of the apartment. Janine is, like, stretching all over the place. You know? Everywhere I look, she's like I can see why that's hard to resist. I like her so much.\n\nOh, I'm sorry, sweetie, that she doesn't feel the same way. I know. She's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair. You are aware that she's not a monkey.\n\nRight? I am so over Janine. I mean, I, yeah. At first, I thought she was hot, but now she's like old news. Hey, guys.\n\nJanine. I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of dick and rock and Dickie Eve. Hold it. Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Years Rockin' Eve?\n\nYeah. That's what I said. Oh my god. We love that show. Bigross, and I've been watching it So I I so I can remember.\n\nYeah. You're still just a little fat girl inside, aren't you? Well, I'm gonna be out of this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people. What?\n\nYou're gonna be a party person? Those guys rock the most. Well, they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner? Totally.\n\nI would love to spend New Year's with you. No. Well, See, they're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why. Oh, well, you see, how it works is the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, But they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time.\n\nYeah. Not a lot of people know that. Yeah. Well, do you guys wanna come too? Are you serious?\n\nWe are there. Hang on. Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her? Well, thanks. Great.\n\nSo we can all go together. I gotta run. I'll catch you later. Bye. Bye, Janine.\n\nDid she just ask me out on a date? I don't think so. What what are you talking about? He she just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium. Yeah.\n\nBut she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey. I'm I'm sorry, but I don't think that that was a romantic thing. Maybe. But, hey.\n\nI know how I can find out. Well, we're going on a New Year's Eve party. Right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And she kisses me back, great.\n\nYou know? And and she says, dude, what the hell are you doing? I can say it wasn't me. It was New Year's.
