Phoebe, will you will you help me out here? Well, I thought you loved her when you when you married her. We were drunk. I would have married, Joey with that amount of alcohol. Hey. You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani. I'm sorry, But you guys are wrong. I just don't wanna be divorced 3 times. Yes. And now he's using this 3 divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say well done. Bravo, Meg. Okay. Fine. Fine. If this is what you think, Forget about the whole 3 divorce thing. Okay? I I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled. Okay? That means she means nothing to me. Not Nothing. Okay. Now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy. I am so attracted to him right now. Okay. When are we tell Rachel what actually is going to happen. Soon. I I just couldn't before. I mean, you saw how upset Joey got. I couldn't do that to her. My best friend. Well, Joey's my best friend. I'm not your best friend? You just shit. Of course, you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel, though? Alright. Alright. At least I'm prepared. Okay. Oh, yes. Hey. Hey. Hey. These aren't for you? Are you upset? I am now. Hey, roomie. Okay. Bye. Rach, there's something, important I have to tell you. Are you pregnant? No. But I'm throwing this shirt away. I think there's a little, misunderstanding before. Mhmm. When I said that, that Chandler and I wanted to, live together, We met alone together. Oh my god. Oh, that's funny. I can't believe I did that. Oh, no, sweetie. No. You know what? This is my fault. I I wasn't clear. I I'm really sorry. And, Ayla, listen. You take as much time as you need to move out. Okay? There's absolutely no rush. Okay. Okay. Don't you want a cookie? Sure. Thanks. Maybe do you need a tissue? Margaret, where did you get these? I made them. Oh, god. Just so yummy. Okay. Who whose is this? It's mine. What about this? Whose is this? That's mine. Okay. Whose dishwashing soap is this? That was here when we moved in. Well, I guess it really is concentrated. Gosh. It could be weird, like, when I come home and you're not here. You know? No more Julian Chans. No more JNCs. Wanna go over to Julian Chambers? Can't. It's not there. I'm just gonna be across the hall. We can still do all the same stuff. Yeah. But we won't be able to, like, get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings in the future. Not once did we do that. Don't you remember that night? It was late, and I was feeling sick, and you said I would feel better tomorrow. Oh, yeah. I don't know. I'm just Just gonna miss living with you. Yeah. Me too, man. What the hell is that? That's disgusting. Hi. Hey. Hey. So I I told Rachel that it just wouldn't be the 2 of us. Oh, yeah? Well, how'd she take it? Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah. She she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad. And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry? I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion. Is that too much to ask after 6 years? And what? Are are Rachel and I not as close as you guys? I mean, did we not have as much fun? Don't I deserve a few tears? We we told Joey he cried his eyes out. Hey. He did not cry my eyes out. Come on. It's like the end of an era. No more J. Mann and Channies. Okay. I gotta ask. Who calls us that? You got married Again. Yes. So that's your 2nd marriage in 2 years? Yes. 2nd in 2 years. 3rd, overall Ross, I have been a divorce Attorney for 23 years and never have I had so much business from 1 client. Why don't you tell me what happened? Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas, and we got drunk. I mean I'm sorry. Is this the same Rachel whose name you said at the altar in the second marriage? Yes. Yes. Yes. But I I do not love her. Oh, that's better then. This was just a drunken mistake, and I I need to get it annulled. I see. Have you considered therapy? I think just the annulment for today. There are a couple of forms to fill out. Easy. And we'll need to have witnesses who testify that you were not of a sound mind. No problem. And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge. Oh, there's no way to do this without her? Because I kinda already told her, it was it was taken care of. Of course, you did. Look, Ross. You can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both There. Uh-huh. What about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy. Hey. Hey. So, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff. Okay. No. No no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore. Okay. Hey, Rach. Yeah. What about this? Who gets this? See, I I don't know if I want it because, you know, it might be too many memories. What the hell is that? I don't know. Which one? How about the big plate? I want you to have the big plate. Oh, wow. Monica, thanks. I love this plate. Something to remember me by. Come on. Honey, you're not dying. I'm just moving out. You know, I mean, we're gonna see each other all the time, But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say. Are you okay? You're not blinking. Fine. I just I was thinking about how it's it's an end of an era. Oh, alright. But, you know, I gotta say, I don't I don't think 6 years counts as an era. An era is defined as a significant period of time. And if it was significant for me, maybe it wasn't significant to you. What is the matter with you? What the matter with you? Why are you more upset? Aren't you gonna be sad that we that we're not living together anymore? Hey. Aren't you gonna miss me at all? Monica. Alright. But don't get mad at me. I it's it's just a little hard to believe. That's hard to believe. Well, you know, I mean, it's you guys. You you do this kind of stuff. You know? I mean, you you you were gonna get Married in Vegas, and then you backed out? It's I I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you actually going through with it. I'm sorry. Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here, But I I'm gonna wait. Wait. Just let me finish. Okay? This isn't something that we just just impossibly decided to do in in Vegas. This is something that we both really want, and it is going to happen. It is? Really? Yes. Really? You know, we're we're not gonna live together anymore? No. What? Oh my god. I miss you so much. I love it too. I mean, it's the end of an era. I know. Gabe, bye. Oh, no. So did you get the annulment? I couldn't. I knew it because you love Rachel. It's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I complicated because of the love. I I do I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay. Would I do that if if I loved her? I've never been more convinced of your love for her. I do not have feelings for Rachel. Okay? Oh, what's wrong? Monica and Chandler are really moving in here, and I have to move out, and everything is changing. Oh, my god. Come here. Come here. It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. Thank you. Of course. So Ross and Rachel got married. Monica and Chandler almost got married. Do you think you and I should hook up? We do, but not just yet. Really? For when? Okay. Well, first, Chandler and Monica will get married And be filthy rich, by the way. Yeah. But, it won't work out. Wow. I know. Then I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money, And you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids. Great. But then we ditch those 2, and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids, and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem. Don't worry. What about Rose? I don't wanna go into the whole thing, but, we have words and I kill him.", "confidence": 0.99850637, "words": [{"word": "is", "start": 0.39999998, "end": 0.48, "confidence": 0.98672,

I have loved her in the past, but now she is just my wife. Phoebe, will you will you help me out here? Well, I thought you loved her when you when you married her. We were drunk. I would have married, Joey with that amount of alcohol.\n\nHey. You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani. I'm sorry, But you guys are wrong. I just don't wanna be divorced 3 times. Yes.\n\nAnd now he's using this 3 divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say well done. Bravo, Meg. Okay. Fine.\n\nFine. If this is what you think, Forget about the whole 3 divorce thing. Okay? I I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled. Okay?\n\nThat means she means nothing to me. Not Nothing. Okay. Now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy. I am so attracted to him right now.\n\nOkay. When are we tell Rachel what actually is going to happen. Soon. I I just couldn't before. I mean, you saw how upset Joey got.\n\nI couldn't do that to her. My best friend. Well, Joey's my best friend. I'm not your best friend? You just shit.\n\nOf course, you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel, though? Alright. Alright. At least I'm prepared.\n\nOkay. Oh, yes. Hey. Hey. Hey.\n\nThese aren't for you? Are you upset? I am now. Hey, roomie. Okay.\n\nBye. Rach, there's something, important I have to tell you. Are you pregnant? No. But I'm throwing this shirt away.\n\nI think there's a little, misunderstanding before. Mhmm. When I said that, that Chandler and I wanted to, live together, We met alone together. Oh my god. Oh, that's funny.\n\nI can't believe I did that. Oh, no, sweetie. No. You know what? This is my fault.\n\nI I wasn't clear. I I'm really sorry. And, Ayla, listen. You take as much time as you need to move out. Okay?\n\nThere's absolutely no rush. Okay. Okay. Don't you want a cookie? Sure.\n\nThanks. Maybe do you need a tissue? Margaret, where did you get these? I made them. Oh, god.\n\nJust so yummy. Okay. Who whose is this? It's mine. What about this?\n\nWhose is this? That's mine. Okay. Whose dishwashing soap is this? That was here when we moved in.\n\nWell, I guess it really is concentrated. Gosh. It could be weird, like, when I come home and you're not here. You know? No more Julian Chans.\n\nNo more JNCs. Wanna go over to Julian Chambers? Can't. It's not there. I'm just gonna be across the hall.\n\nWe can still do all the same stuff. Yeah. But we won't be able to, like, get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings in the future. Not once did we do that. Don't you remember that night?\n\nIt was late, and I was feeling sick, and you said I would feel better tomorrow. Oh, yeah. I don't know. I'm just Just gonna miss living with you. Yeah.\n\nMe too, man. What the hell is that? That's disgusting. Hi. Hey.\n\nHey. So I I told Rachel that it just wouldn't be the 2 of us. Oh, yeah? Well, how'd she take it? Really well.\n\nYeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah. She she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.\n\nAnd you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry? I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion. Is that too much to ask after 6 years? And what? Are are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?\n\nI mean, did we not have as much fun? Don't I deserve a few tears? We we told Joey he cried his eyes out. Hey. He did not cry my eyes out.\n\nCome on. It's like the end of an era. No more J. Mann and Channies. Okay.\n\nI gotta ask. Who calls us that? You got married Again. Yes. So that's your 2nd marriage in 2 years?\n\nYes. 2nd in 2 years. 3rd, overall Ross, I have been a divorce Attorney for 23 years and never have I had so much business from 1 client. Why don't you tell me what happened? Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas, and we got drunk.\n\nI mean I'm sorry. Is this the same Rachel whose name you said at the altar in the second marriage? Yes. Yes. Yes.\n\nBut I I do not love her. Oh, that's better then. This was just a drunken mistake, and I I need to get it annulled. I see. Have you considered therapy?\n\nI think just the annulment for today. There are a couple of forms to fill out. Easy. And we'll need to have witnesses who testify that you were not of a sound mind. No problem.\n\nAnd we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge. Oh, there's no way to do this without her? Because I kinda already told her, it was it was taken care of. Of course, you did. Look, Ross.\n\nYou can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both There. Uh-huh. What about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy. Hey.\n\nHey. So, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff. Okay. No. No no point in dragging it out.\n\nDragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore. Okay. Hey, Rach. Yeah. What about this?\n\nWho gets this? See, I I don't know if I want it because, you know, it might be too many memories. What the hell is that? I don't know. Which one?\n\nHow about the big plate? I want you to have the big plate. Oh, wow. Monica, thanks. I love this plate.\n\nSomething to remember me by. Come on. Honey, you're not dying. I'm just moving out. You know, I mean, we're gonna see each other all the time, But still, it's a big change.\n\nThe end of an era, you might say. Are you okay? You're not blinking. Fine. I just I was thinking about how it's it's an end of an era.\n\nOh, alright. But, you know, I gotta say, I don't I don't think 6 years counts as an era. An era is defined as a significant period of time. And if it was significant for me, maybe it wasn't significant to you. What is the matter with you?\n\nWhat the matter with you? Why are you more upset? Aren't you gonna be sad that we that we're not living together anymore? Hey. Aren't you gonna miss me at all?\n\nMonica. Alright. But don't get mad at me. I it's it's just a little hard to believe. That's hard to believe.\n\nWell, you know, I mean, it's you guys. You you do this kind of stuff. You know? I mean, you you you were gonna get Married in Vegas, and then you backed out? It's I I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you actually going through with it.\n\nI'm sorry. Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here, But I I'm gonna wait. Wait. Just let me finish.\n\nOkay? This isn't something that we just just impossibly decided to do in in Vegas. This is something that we both really want, and it is going to happen. It is? Really?\n\nYes. Really? You know, we're we're not gonna live together anymore? No. What?\n\nOh my god. I miss you so much. I love it too. I mean, it's the end of an era. I know.\n\nGabe, bye. Oh, no. So did you get the annulment? I couldn't. I knew it because you love Rachel.\n\nIt's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I complicated because of the love. I I do I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible.\n\nOkay. Would I do that if if I loved her? I've never been more convinced of your love for her. I do not have feelings for Rachel. Okay?\n\nOh, what's wrong? Monica and Chandler are really moving in here, and I have to move out, and everything is changing. Oh, my god. Come here. Come here.\n\nIt's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. Thank you. Of course. So Ross and Rachel got married.\n\nMonica and Chandler almost got married. Do you think you and I should hook up? We do, but not just yet. Really? For when?\n\nOkay. Well, first, Chandler and Monica will get married And be filthy rich, by the way. Yeah. But, it won't work out. Wow.\n\nI know. Then I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money, And you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids. Great. But then we ditch those 2, and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids, and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.\n\nDon't worry. What about Rose?
