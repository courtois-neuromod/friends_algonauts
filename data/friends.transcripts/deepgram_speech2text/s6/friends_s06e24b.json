Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center. I can't tell you how happy I am you brought him. Oh, It's always more why. Just out of curiosity, how much is that boat worth? I think it was valued at 19,000. Yeah. I was pretty close. So bad news. I can't buy the boat. I don't have any money. Joey. Joey, good one.

We are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference. Okay. Okay. Look. I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway. You know? They should just watch TV after school like I did, And I turned out fine. Not great. Boy, I'm helping the kids so much. I think I'm gonna throw up. So we're hiding in the bathroom. And then I sneak out, but before Where Monica can, her parents come in.

Yes. Or if you prefer, this table's available. That might be fun. What were you thinking?\n\nI didn't know it was an auction. I figured I'd take a guess. Help a charity. Free boat. Why would a charity give away a free boat?\n\nI don't know. Charity? Oh, I'll just buy the damn boat. Phoebe, Don't you don't you think you've had enough to drink? I'm just helping the kids.\n\nHow is you drinking helping the kids. Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink. Mister Tribbiani Hi. Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center. I can't tell you how happy I am you brought him.\n\nOh, It's always more why. Just out of curiosity, how much is that boat worth? I think it was valued at 19,000. Yeah. I was pretty close.\n\nSo bad news. I can't buy the boat. I don't have any money. Joey. Joey, good one.\n\nIt is silly. Very good. Very good. Good. Good.\n\nSo, listen. I think I'm gonna take off now. Hey. You cannot leave, Joey. You're afraid to buy that boat.\n\nAlright? It is a contract. And, plus, if you leave, My boss is gonna kill me. Well, what am I gonna do, rage? I don't have that kind of money.\n\nI know. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.\n\nAlright. Alright. This is what we're gonna do. We are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference. Okay.\n\nOkay. Look. I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway. You know? They should just watch TV after school like I did, And I turned out fine.\n\nNot great. Boy, I'm helping the kids so much. I think I'm gonna throw up. So we're hiding in the bathroom. And then I sneak out, but before Where Monica can, her parents come in.\n\nSo I hide in the shower, and then the next thing you know, they're going at it right on the bathroom floor. Oh my god. I got a good one. I got a good one. I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.\n\nIt's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast. As the poet once said, in the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for, In the dew of little things, the heart finds its morning and is refreshed. Oh, What? Oh my god, you guys.\n\nBefore you say anything, if we got a story for you, guess who we bumped into at dinner. Who? Richard. Oh. Oh.\n\nOh. Oh. That's right. That's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.\n\nOh, you knew that? Good. I thought you were going out with Elizabeth. Yeah. I was, but, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.\n\nOh, boy. Sometimes grown ups have commitments they just can't get out of. Maybe she is too young for me. When I was over there and she was Running around with their friends, I I felt like I was a babysitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about.\n\nI don't know what to do. Why don't you just weigh out the good about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean, that's what I did when I first started weighing stuff. Okay. Bad stuff.\n\nWell, I'm I'm 12 years older than she is. If the school finds out, you're fired. She's leaving for 3 months. Or a camp. Okay.\n\nGood stuff. Well, she's she's sweet and pretty. And And the sex is probably pretty great. Oh, woah. It's tender and respectful, if that's what you mean.\n\nLook, Ross. The only question you need to answer is, do you future. I mean, like, do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my god. You did it already.\n\nYou married her, didn't you? No. No. It didn't do that. It's just Oh.\n\nOkay. Honestly, no. I don't I don't see a Big future with her. K. Well, I I think that's your answer.\n\nI gotta talk to her. Oh, I hate this part. You have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean, if you're not careful, you may not get married at all this year.
