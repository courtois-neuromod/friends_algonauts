Yeah. I mean, we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. You you you're gonna bring the Barker Lounge over here? Is that a problem? Well, it's just that they're a set, and they should probably stay together. Well, that's cool. Then I'll just, bring them both over. See now? Now you're taking them away from their home. Okay. I get it. So I get nothing. Nothing here is mine. Everything is yours. I'll get up in the morning, put on your clothes, and head off to work. Yeah. Yeah. You know Yeah. Yeah. That's it. That's it. Everything will be mine. Nothing will be yours. That that's what I said. Oh, come on, Chandler. I'm talking about that bargain lounger. It just it doesn't match. Where is it gonna go? In the game room. Look. It is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly. Alright. That's fine. That's fine. I won't bring over the chairs. I won't bring anything over. I wouldn't wanna ruin the ambiance over here at grandma's place. Everything on your application looks really good. Oh, just One last question. Are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time, like, partying and hanging out? Oh, don't worry. I'm not really a party girl. Woah. Don't just be blurting stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. You can call up the roommate, sir. Hi. I'll be living here. Don't listen to him. He's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get Why did you take the shower curtain down? That thing was a hazard. I'm very safety conscious. Hey. Hey. Oh, I was just clearing some space for your stuff. Oh, thanks. But listen. I was just at Monica's, and she and Chandler had a big Fight, and they're not moving in. What do you mean they're not moving in? The they're still moving in. Right? No. No. They just had a big blowout over what to do with my Room? What? Over a stupid room? I know. I feel kinda bad for him, but I'm also really psyched because now I don't have to move in here. Oh, no. Yeah. No. That part's great. What's all this about you guys fighting? Is this really over a room? I mean, that is so silly. Ross, we can handle this. Well, Apparently not. And I can't just stand by and watch 2 people I care about so much be hurt by something that is so Silly. I mean, enough, of the silliness. Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly? Understand the beginning of the day. Okay. Okay. Two very good points. Look. I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you 1 millionth as happy as you've been since you got together. Do you really wanna throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. What's more important, love or silliness? Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love. Love is the best medicine. That's laughter. Why do you do it? I don't know. Okay. Alright. Now, Chandler, You you wanna live with Monica. Right? Yeah. I do. And, ma'am, you wanna live with Chandler, don't you? Yes. Good. A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York. So I understand you're looking for a place. No. No. I'm staying put. Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment. Why? Where are you gone? I don't know. Hey, Paige. Hi. You're never gonna believe it. Monica and Chandler moving in again. It's great news. Right? I mean, for them. Right? Oh, wow. Yeah. But on the bright side, we get to be roommates again. Yeah. You know, about that, Ross, I I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird? Why? Why? Why why would it why would it be weird? Well, you know, be because of us, Because of our history. No. No? No. No. It would only be weird if we were still in that Place. I mean, are you still in that place? No. Not at all. Good. Me neither. So it's not a problem. We're just 2 friends who happen to be roommates. Okay. But, Ross, eventually, you and I are gonna be dating. Really? We are. Well, yeah. I'm gonna have a boyfriend. You're gonna have a girlfriend. Oh, that'd be great. But you know what? If you think it's gonna be okay, we'll just work out a system. You know what it'll be like in college? I'll hang a hanger on door and put a sign, come back later. I'm getting lucky. Yeah. I I didn't think of that. So are you sure about This whole moving in thing, I mean, it's a really big step, and and what's the rush? That's very funny. He's being silly because he knows that we enjoy the silliness. No. I I I I'm serious. Okay? I mean, think about it. You move in. You start fighting over stupid game rooms. Next thing you know, you break up. Ross, you were right before. It was just a stupid fight about a room. Okay. There are no stupid fights. This isn't about the room. This is about what the room represents. And, unfortunately, This room could destroy you. Yeah. I'm not so worried. Yeah. No. Me neither. Fine. It's your life. I just don't wanna see you guys break up, you know, which you will do if you move in together. But if that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. Don't do it. You still wanna move in together. Right? Of course. Ross didn't scare you? Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him. Come here. Gonna show you something. Okay. Oh my god. Someone's killed Square Man. This is where I thought the barking lounger could go. You see, you can see the TV, And still, it's walking distance to the kitchen. Oh, that's so sweet. I wanna show you something too. Okay. You know those big big, road signs that say that say Merge. Mhmm. You know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed because that's you and I together. Merge. Oh my god. I love that. Really? No. I found you in my bed. How'd you wind up there? Are a mystery. Little black curly hair. Little black curly hair. Now Now if you wanna receive emails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer. So, where are the other guys? Well, let's see. Monica and Chandler are occupied. Fighting? No. The other thing. I really think it's great they work things out. Yeah. There's no breaking them up, is there? Hey. Can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy? Sure. Can. Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make Copy. There's no turning back. Yeah. I'm I'm sure. Now get out of here before I change my mind. Listen. Do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea? I've been back and forth. Yeah. Well, maybe you should go back. Okay? Rachel moves in, before you know it, you're right where you don't wanna be, back together. Yeah. I don't I don't think so, and she's really talking about, you know, dating other guys. That's not gonna work out. She's gonna come home all weepy, and you'll be telling her, oh, that's okay. You'll find someone. And then, bam, She finds you. What? Oh, may maybe you're right. I am telling you, Roshy is definitely gonna fall in love with you again. Now is that what you want? Is that what I want? Yes. Hold on. I'm gonna make your life much easier. Alright. Well, the place was closed. I'll just copy it later. Or not. Rach, why don't you just move in with me? Oh, woah. Woah. Joey. No. No. No. No. No. No. It's okay. I mean, I look, Rach. I know I scared you off with that whole naked Thursdays thing, but we don't have to do that. Well, It would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute. Unless you're thinking about naked Wednesdays. Thursday's clearly not good for you. Pick a day. Hi. Hi. Come on in. Thanks for coming back. Okay. There've been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down, and you are one of the Finalist. That's great. Okay. Now before I make my decision, I, I just wanna make sure that our personalities match. Okay? So I made up a little test. Now I'm gonna say a word, and then you say the first thing that comes to mind. I can do that. Okay. Here we go. Pillow. Fight. Very good. Okay. G. String? Excellent. Okay. Doggy. Kitten? Oh, sorry. So close, though. But okay.

"\nChanges? Yeah. I mean, we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. You you you're gonna bring the Barker Lounge over here? Is that a problem?\n\nWell, it's just that they're a set, and they should probably stay together. Well, that's cool. Then I'll just, bring them both over. See now? Now you're taking them away from their home.\n\nOkay. I get it. So I get nothing. Nothing here is mine. Everything is yours.\n\nI'll get up in the morning, put on your clothes, and head off to work. Yeah. Yeah. You know Yeah. Yeah.\n\nThat's it. That's it. Everything will be mine. Nothing will be yours. That that's what I said.\n\nOh, come on, Chandler. I'm talking about that bargain lounger. It just it doesn't match. Where is it gonna go? In the game room.\n\nLook. It is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly. Alright. That's fine. That's fine.\n\nI won't bring over the chairs. I won't bring anything over. I wouldn't wanna ruin the ambiance over here at grandma's place. Everything on your application looks really good. Oh, just One last question.\n\nAre you and your friends gonna be over here all the time, like, partying and hanging out? Oh, don't worry. I'm not really a party girl. Woah. Don't just be blurting stuff out.\n\nI want you to really think about your answers. You can call up the roommate, sir. Hi. I'll be living here. Don't listen to him.\n\nHe's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get Why did you take the shower curtain down? That thing was a hazard. I'm very safety conscious. Hey. Hey.\n\nOh, I was just clearing some space for your stuff. Oh, thanks. But listen. I was just at Monica's, and she and Chandler had a big Fight, and they're not moving in. What do you mean they're not moving in?\n\nThe they're still moving in. Right? No. No. They just had a big blowout over what to do with my Room?\n\nWhat? Over a stupid room? I know. I feel kinda bad for him, but I'm also really psyched because now I don't have to move in here. Oh, no.\n\nYeah. No. That part's great. What's all this about you guys fighting? Is this really over a room?\n\nI mean, that is so silly. Ross, we can handle this. Well, Apparently not. And I can't just stand by and watch 2 people I care about so much be hurt by something that is so Silly. I mean, enough, of the silliness.\n\nWell, why don't you tell her to stop being silly? Understand the beginning of the day. Okay. Okay. Two very good points.\n\nLook. I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you 1 millionth as happy as you've been since you got together. Do you really wanna throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. What's more important, love or silliness?\n\nWell, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love. Love is the best medicine. That's laughter. Why do you do it? I don't know.\n\nOkay. Alright. Now, Chandler, You you wanna live with Monica. Right? Yeah.\n\nI do. And, ma'am, you wanna live with Chandler, don't you? Yes. Good. A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York.\n\nSo I understand you're looking for a place. No. No. I'm staying put. Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.\n\nWhy? Where are you gone? I don't know. Hey, Paige. Hi.\n\nYou're never gonna believe it. Monica and Chandler moving in again. It's great news. Right? I mean, for them.\n\nRight? Oh, wow. Yeah. But on the bright side, we get to be roommates again. Yeah.\n\nYou know, about that, Ross, I I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird? Why? Why? Why why would it why would it be weird? Well, you know, be because of us, Because of our history.\n\nNo. No? No. No. It would only be weird if we were still in that Place.\n\nI mean, are you still in that place? No. Not at all. Good. Me neither.\n\nSo it's not a problem. We're just 2 friends who happen to be roommates. Okay. But, Ross, eventually, you and I are gonna be dating. Really?\n\nWe are. Well, yeah. I'm gonna have a boyfriend. You're gonna have a girlfriend. Oh, that'd be great.\n\nBut you know what? If you think it's gonna be okay, we'll just work out a system. You know what it'll be like in college? I'll hang a hanger on door and put a sign, come back later. I'm getting lucky.\n\nYeah. I I didn't think of that. So are you sure about This whole moving in thing, I mean, it's a really big step, and and what's the rush? That's very funny. He's being silly because he knows that we enjoy the silliness.\n\nNo. I I I I'm serious. Okay? I mean, think about it. You move in.\n\nYou start fighting over stupid game rooms. Next thing you know, you break up. Ross, you were right before. It was just a stupid fight about a room. Okay.\n\nThere are no stupid fights. This isn't about the room. This is about what the room represents. And, unfortunately, This room could destroy you. Yeah.\n\nI'm not so worried. Yeah. No. Me neither. Fine.\n\nIt's your life. I just don't wanna see you guys break up, you know, which you will do if you move in together. But if that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. Don't do it. You still wanna move in together.\n\nRight? Of course. Ross didn't scare you? Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him. Come here.\n\nGonna show you something. Okay. Oh my god. Someone's killed Square Man. This is where I thought the barking lounger could go.\n\nYou see, you can see the TV, And still, it's walking distance to the kitchen. Oh, that's so sweet. I wanna show you something too. Okay. You know those big big, road signs that say that say Merge.\n\nMhmm. You know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed because that's you and I together. Merge. Oh my god.\n\nI love that. Really? No. I found you in my bed. How'd you wind up there?\n\nAre a mystery. Little black curly hair. Little black curly hair. Now Now if you wanna receive emails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer. So, where are the other guys?\n\nWell, let's see. Monica and Chandler are occupied. Fighting? No. The other thing.\n\nI really think it's great they work things out. Yeah. There's no breaking them up, is there? Hey. Can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?\n\nSure. Can. Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make Copy.\n\nThere's no turning back. Yeah. I'm I'm sure. Now get out of here before I change my mind. Listen.\n\nDo you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea? I've been back and forth. Yeah. Well, maybe you should go back. Okay?\n\nRachel moves in, before you know it, you're right where you don't wanna be, back together. Yeah. I don't I don't think so, and she's really talking about, you know, dating other guys. That's not gonna work out. She's gonna come home all weepy, and you'll be telling her, oh, that's okay.\n\nYou'll find someone. And then, bam, She finds you. What? Oh, may maybe you're right. I am telling you, Roshy is definitely gonna fall in love with you again.\n\nNow is that what you want? Is that what I want? Yes. Hold on. I'm gonna make your life much easier.\n\nAlright. Well, the place was closed. I'll just copy it later. Or not. Rach, why don't you just move in with me?\n\nOh, woah. Woah. Joey. No. No.\n\nNo. No. No. No. It's okay.\n\nI mean, I look, Rach. I know I scared you off with that whole naked Thursdays thing, but we don't have to do that. Well, It would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute. Unless you're thinking about naked Wednesdays.\n\nThursday's clearly not good for you. Pick a day. Hi. Hi. Come on in.\n\nThanks for coming back. Okay. There've been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down, and you are one of the Finalist. That's great. Okay.\n\nNow before I make my decision, I, I just wanna make sure that our personalities match. Okay? So I made up a little test. Now I'm gonna say a word, and then you say the first thing that comes to mind. I can do that.\n\nOkay. Here we go. Pillow. Fight. Very good.\n\nOkay. G. String? Excellent. Okay.\n\nDoggy. Kitten? Oh, sorry. So close, though.
