Damn it. You know, this whole time, we were concentrating on the babies, and no one was watching Chandler. Okay. You 2 are asking the court for an annulment? Yes, your honor. And here are our forms all filled out. So based on your petition, you are Seeking an annulment on the grounds that mister Geller is mentally unstable. Fine. I'm mentally unstable. And based on the fact that mister Geller is an intravenous drug user? What? Yes. Heroin and crack. Crack isn't even an intravenous drug. Well, you would know. Now it also says here that you, lied about your sexual preference before marriage. Oh, come on. Cross, please. I found the magazines. Legazis. And finally, that you were unable to consummate the marriage? Well, that makes sense that you're gay and addicted to heroin. Okay. You know you know, this I'm sorry. This is insane. I I I'm not addicted to heroin. I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything. Look. I'll I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now. That won't be necessary. And when we were dating, We we consummated like bunnies. Now if you 2 were involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem. Your honor, Rest assured, that relationship ended 2 years ago, and can you please strike consummated like bunnies from the record? Is there anything in this record that is Truly true. Well, yes. We, we got married in Vegas, and, and the names, I think. That's not the way the legal system works. This process is based on an objective review of the facts, not of the lie. Objection. It doesn't work like that either. Overrule. Oh, stop it. Doesn't work like that either. Overruled. Oh, stop it. Well, based on what I've heard, you 2 certainly don't qualify for an enrollment. If you don't wanna be together, you'll have to file for divorce. That's great. You happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form. What? Me? What about you and your Consummated like buddies nonsense. And what and what are you typing that for? See what he said, we don't get the annulment. Don't type that. What? Stop typing. Hey. Stop typing. Stop typing. Stop typing. Okay. Okay. Do you see do you see what you are keeping me married to? You need to get out of my chambers. Alright. Look. Lady, here is the deal. I came here for an annulment, and I am not leaving here until I get one. Right. Would you like to spend the night in jam? Okay. Thank you for your time. So the Porsche guy took his car back. But you found the keys to his clothes? No. I just, I just love the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche. And people would think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes? Of course. Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have a car. That is true. Yeah. But only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun. Oh, I've been there. I am gonna go drive my Porsche. Joey, you know you don't actually have one. Come on. What are you doing? I'm in character. Will you talk to her? I think it just moved. It's really poking me. Alright. That's it. We're going to the emergency room. What? No. You can't you can't leave me here with them. We're babysitting. The babies are asleep. I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while. But you you can't leave me with them. We're we're a team. We're playing the zone. They're gonna triple team me. He's got something plastic lodged into his throat. We've gotta go to the at all. But no. Because a a doctor won't be able to help him, and it's just gonna, you know, naturally pass through his system in, like, 7 years. I think that's gum. I'm pretty sure it's gun. Hey. Listen. This really hurts. Let's go. But, Noah, come a real man wouldn't just run to the hospital. No. But what what would Grom do? Oh, why isn't that valet back with my Porsche? Maybe because you've got the keys. That's totally your fault. My fault? You threatened the judge. Well, you ripped the Paper on the court reporter's machine. That was the only way I could get him to stop typing. Hi. How are the Gellers? Don't call us that. The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment. Now we gotta get the bards, did a push throw up on you? Hey. Let's push up. We're taking care of you with no problem. You guys feel safe. Right? Yeah. I'm gonna take that spit bubble as a yeah. I do. Okay. Let's get rid of this dirty diaper, Leslie. I'll stay up with a nice clean one. Okay. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? Because let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it. Alright. Well, that's just the way things go. Okay. Good. Why are there only 2 of you? Where's Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you, Leslie? K. Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words. Well, look at you. Hey. You are a little bit mischievous. My gosh. Ow. Oh, you're a lot mischievous. It'll dry. Okay. You sit with your brother and sister now who aren't there. How do you feel? Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to Destroy the universe again in 12 to 14 hours. Okay. So I totally took care of the babies all by myself. I fed him, bathed him, and put him to bed. And protected them from a tornado? Oh my god. I know. The babies are asleep. Mimi, what what happened here. I did it. I took care of the babies all by myself. On my apartment. Was the setting of Phoebe's Triumph. With the mess is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself. Right. You're right. I shouldn't freak out because this is what it's gonna be like when you and I have babies. When will that be? Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess? Oh, honey. Thank god you're home. I was getting worried. I picked up the divorce papers. I've already signed everything, and I put little x's where you need to sign. Oh, little x's. Great. That makes up for everything. You know, you've done a lot of stupid stuff too. Okay? Oh, name 1 stupid thing that is as stupid as this one. Okay. How about you flew to London to stop my wedding? How about you told me you loved me after I was already married? Wait a minute. That was different. I did those think it's because I was in love with you. Yeah. Right. You're right. That's very different. So let's let's just sign the papers. What? Nothing. Okay. Can we just sign, please? Mhmm. Congratulations. Okay. Wait. Ross, we're wait a minute. I, kinda have a little confession. What? Well, you know, this whole marriage Interesting. Kinda my idea. Excuse me? Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married? Yeah. And, Yeah. I didn't really I didn't wanna say anything, but it just kinda kept coming back to me. And, remember we were in the casino, and for some reason, you thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a as a compromise, we decided first to get married And then To eat vodka. Grapes. So, Sorry. I got us into this whole thing. So then if if, I mean, if you think about it, this is all your fault. Yeah. Don't push it, though. I gotta say, I know we divorce a lot of women. Never thought I'd be divorcing you. I know. I always thought if you and I got married, that would be the one that stuck, and it wouldn't be a Secret. And we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut. Did I did I even treat? No. It was on the house. It was it was a newlywed special. That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. Right. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office. Yeah. Hey. Thanks, Ross, for taking care of all this. No problem. I'm gonna need a copy of those. Totally. Yep. Hey. Hey. Hey. Be careful around my Porsche. Hi, Joey. Hey. How are you doing? He has the most amazing Porsche under there. I'd love to show you, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping.

Damn it. You know, this whole time, we were concentrating on the babies, and no one was watching Chandler. Okay. You 2 are asking the court for an annulment?\n\nYes, your honor. And here are our forms all filled out. So based on your petition, you are Seeking an annulment on the grounds that mister Geller is mentally unstable. Fine. I'm mentally unstable.\n\nAnd based on the fact that mister Geller is an intravenous drug user? What? Yes. Heroin and crack. Crack isn't even an intravenous drug.\n\nWell, you would know. Now it also says here that you, lied about your sexual preference before marriage. Oh, come on. Cross, please. I found the magazines.\n\nLegazis. And finally, that you were unable to consummate the marriage? Well, that makes sense that you're gay and addicted to heroin. Okay. You know you know, this I'm sorry.\n\nThis is insane. I I I'm not addicted to heroin. I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything. Look. I'll I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now.\n\nThat won't be necessary. And when we were dating, We we consummated like bunnies. Now if you 2 were involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem. Your honor, Rest assured, that relationship ended 2 years ago, and can you please strike consummated like bunnies from the record? Is there anything in this record that is Truly true.\n\nWell, yes. We, we got married in Vegas, and, and the names, I think. That's not the way the legal system works. This process is based on an objective review of the facts, not of the lie. Objection.\n\nIt doesn't work like that either. Overrule. Oh, stop it. Doesn't work like that either. Overruled.\n\nOh, stop it. Well, based on what I've heard, you 2 certainly don't qualify for an enrollment. If you don't wanna be together, you'll have to file for divorce. That's great. You happy now?\n\nLook what you did with your funny, funny form. What? Me? What about you and your Consummated like buddies nonsense.

Okay.\n\nDo you see do you see what you are keeping me married to? You need to get out of my chambers. Alright. Look. Lady, here is the deal.\n\nI came here for an annulment, and I am not leaving here until I get one. Right. Would you like to spend the night in jam? Okay. Thank you for your time.\n\nSo the Porsche guy took his car back. But you found the keys to his clothes? No. I just, I just love the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche. And people would think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?\n\nOf course. Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have a car. That is true. Yeah. But only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.\n\nOh, I've been there. I am gonna go drive my Porsche. Joey, you know you don't actually have one. Come on. What are you doing?\n\nI'm in character. Will you talk to her? I think it just moved. It's really poking me. Alright.\n\nThat's it. We're going to the emergency room. What?

Listen.\n\nThis really hurts. Let's go. But, Noah, come a real man wouldn't just run to the hospital. No. But what what would Grom do?\n\nOh, why isn't that valet back with my Porsche? Maybe because you've got the keys. That's totally your fault. My fault? You threatened the judge.\n\nWell, you ripped the Paper on the court reporter's machine. That was the only way I could get him to stop typing. Hi. How are the Gellers? Don't call us that.\n\nThe judge wouldn't let us get an annulment.

Because let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it.\n\nAlright. Well, that's just the way things go. Okay. Good. Why are there only 2 of you?\n\nWhere's Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you, Leslie? K.\n\nLeslie, now would be a good time for your first words. Well, look at you. Hey. You are a little bit mischievous. My gosh.\n\nOw. Oh, you're a lot mischievous. It'll dry. Okay. You sit with your brother and sister now who aren't there.\n\nHow do you feel? Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to Destroy the universe again in 12 to 14 hours. Okay. So I totally took care of the babies all by myself. I fed him, bathed him, and put him to bed.\n\nAnd protected them from a tornado? Oh my god. I know. The babies are asleep. Mimi, what what happened here.\n\nI did it. I took care of the babies all by myself. On my apartment. Was the setting of Phoebe's Triumph. With the mess is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.\n\nRight. You're right. I shouldn't freak out because this is what it's gonna be like when you and I have babies. When will that be? Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess?\n\nOh, honey. Thank god you're home. I was getting worried. I picked up the divorce papers. I've already signed everything, and I put little x's where you need to sign.\n\nOh, little x's. Great. That makes up for everything. You know, you've done a lot of stupid stuff too. Okay?\n\nOh, name 1 stupid thing that is as stupid as this one. Okay. How about you flew to London to stop my wedding? How about you told me you loved me after I was already married? Wait a minute.\n\nThat was different. I did those think it's because I was in love with you. Yeah. Right. You're right.\n\nThat's very different. So let's let's just sign the papers. What? Nothing. Okay.\n\nCan we just sign, please? Mhmm. Congratulations. Okay. Wait.\n\nRoss, we're wait a minute. I, kinda have a little confession. What? Well, you know, this whole marriage Interesting. Kinda my idea.\n\nExcuse me? Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married? Yeah. And, Yeah. I didn't really I didn't wanna say anything, but it just kinda kept coming back to me.\n\nAnd, remember we were in the casino, and for some reason, you thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a as a compromise, we decided first to get married And then To eat vodka. Grapes. So, Sorry.\n\nI got us into this whole thing. So then if if, I mean, if you think about it, this is all your fault. Yeah. Don't push it, though. I gotta say, I know we divorce a lot of women.\n\nNever thought I'd be divorcing you. I know. I always thought if you and I got married, that would be the one that stuck, and it wouldn't be a Secret. And we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut. Did I did I even treat?\n\nNo. It was on the house. It was it was a newlywed special. That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. Right.\n\nI should probably get these to my lawyer's office. Yeah. Hey. Thanks, Ross, for taking care of all this. No problem.\n\nI'm gonna need a copy of those. Totally. Yep. Hey. Hey.\n\nHey. Be careful around my Porsche. Hi, Joey. Hey. How are you doing?\n\nHe has the most amazing Porsche under there. I'd love to show you, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping.
