He can destroy the universe. Well, Chandler, they could swallow one of those little parts. And, also, look at his smooth area. That's just gonna mess them up. It's just not an appropriate toy for 1 year olds or 30 year olds. They're not gonna swallow anything. You guys are being way too overprotective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just Throw me into a pile of broken glass. What? Glass, sand, whatever. Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep. Oh, it's so cute. I wonder what age it is that you stop being able to put both legs behind your head. Oh, I can I still do that? How are you still single? Alright. I thought about it, and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy. Oh, good. What made you change your mind? I swallowed a sonic blaster gun. How did that happen?

Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping, And, you know, Bond, you can be in charge of diapering, and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around them. That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping. Okay. I'm a rookie.\n\nI should not be in the end zone. Wow. So great. This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant. Yeah.\n\nWell, this is not what I ordered. Hey, guys. Hi. Hey. Hey, babies.\n\nOh, I'm having the best morning. That, that Porsche I've got the keys to, still there. Shocking since you Still have the keys. You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car. People are friendly.\n\nThey they wanna Talk and not just about the car. 1 guy gave me advice about my equity investments. What equity investments? The ones that got me the Porsche. Will you keep up?\n\nI figured if if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right, Monica? You got a bucket and some soap I can put on? Oh, yeah.\n\nI got I got soap and sponges and rags and carnauba Wax and polishing compound. You don't even have a car. I know.

And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining this is so easy.\n\nYeah. 2 hours a lifetime. That's the same. Check it out. Check it out.\n\nWhen the babies wake up, think of me, krug. What are you doing? That thing could put someone's eye out. He can do more than that. He can destroy the universe.\n\nWell, Chandler, they could swallow one of those little parts. And, also, look at his smooth area. That's just gonna mess them up. It's just not an appropriate toy for 1 year olds or 30 year olds. They're not gonna swallow anything.\n\nYou guys are being way too overprotective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just Throw me into a pile of broken glass. What? Glass, sand, whatever. Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.\n\nOh, it's so cute. I wonder what age it is that you stop being able to put both legs behind your head. Oh, I can I still do that? How are you still single? Alright.\n\nI thought about it, and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy. Oh, good. What made you change your mind? I swallowed a sonic blaster gun.\n\nHow did that happen?
