We actually missed it. Well, maybe you wouldn't have if you could run-in the chapel. I can't believe Ross and Rachel got married. I know. I didn't even know they were dating again. Well, I don't think there is much dating as they are 2 bottles of vodka walking around in human form. This is insane. That's the big deal. You know? It's not like it's a real marriage. You what? Yeah. If you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas. What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas, you're married everywhere. Really? Yeah. Oh my god.

Yeah. Yeah. That guy's finally gonna be able to put in that pool. Yeah. Okay. Now this one's free, right, because you paid for the first 2, so you get the 3rd one for free. Laugh it up, but the joke's on you because we don't need to get divorced. K? We we're just gonna get an annulment. An annulment? Ross, I don't think surgery is the answer here.

So say, Say you roll another 8? Then there's a definite sign that we should get married. Alright. 8, we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, we don't get married. Sounds great. Okay. Okay. Hey. We got a shoe dock. Money Blaze. Ready? Ready. Come on. 8? What happened? Yes. Yes. 8. 8. Easy 8. Wow. I believe I actually rolled an 8. That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married, I guess. That wasn't a hard eight. Last night, I rolled a hard eight. That's right. It was the wrong kind of eight. No wedding. Damn it. That is so bad. Stop. Wanna go pack? Yeah. We're doing the right thing. Right? Oh, of course, we are. We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married, there would be a clear cut sign. Okay. You have I have 19 questions left.

This is it. Are you sure you wanna do this? Hello, missus Brown. What are you, mister Rachel?\n\nHey, Joe. Woah. Oh my god. Mom, please hurry. Hurry.\n\nHurry. Hurry. Hurry. Okay. Oh my god.\n\nIs everybody getting married? There's no running in the chapel. Hey. Don't you give Me, any of your hey. Hey.\n\nHey. What are you guys doing here? Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married. Isn't that why you guys are here? Yes, sweetie.\n\nThat's what we asked. Else will we be here? Well, what happened? Did we miss it? We actually missed it.\n\nWell, maybe you wouldn't have if you could run-in the chapel. I can't believe Ross and Rachel got married. I know. I didn't even know they were dating again. Well, I don't think there is much dating as they are 2 bottles of vodka walking around in human form.\n\nThis is insane. That's the big deal. You know? It's not like it's a real marriage. You what?\n\nYeah. If you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas. What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas, you're married everywhere. Really?\n\nYeah. Oh my god. Well Why are we in bed together? I don't know. Did we?\n\nI don't know. Do do you have a do you have any clothes on? Yes. Really? No.\n\nBut we we didn't have sex, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about Last night, it was such a blur. Oh, I remember laughing. I laughed a lot. Said we didn't have sex.\n\nMhmm. Well, so what what did we do last night? I don't know, but I think it was a lot of fun. Yeah. Luckily, not too much fun.\n\nOh. Right? I don't think so. Oh, thank god. Oh.\n\nOh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid. Tell me about it. What Well, my movie has been officially canceled. Joey, I'm so sorry.\n\nYou want some of my breakfast? Too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in, like, 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just Fly home with you guys. What time does your flight?\n\nWhat about my cab? I don't need that anymore. Joey, you borrowed my cab. You have to drive it back. I don't wanna drive all the way back by myself.\n\nIt gets so lonely. Oh oh, how about if you come with me? I don't know. It's Such a long trip. It'll be great.\n\nWe we could talk and and play games. This could be our chance to, like, renew our friendship. Are you asking for me to have a renaissance? Sure. Alright.\n\nAlthough I don't think we really need 1, baby. I never stopped loving you. Hey. Hey. Hey.\n\nSo has anybody talked to doctor and missus Geller yet? Mhmm. Yeah. They left me a message. They should be here any minute.\n\nWhere is the waitress? I'm starving. It's a buffet, man. Here's where I win all my money back. I gotta talk to you.\n\nSure. What's up? Monica and I almost got married last night. My god. That's huge.\n\nHey. Wait a minute. Why wasn't I invited? And who's gonna be your best man? Don't say Ross.\n\nDo not say Ross. I just don't think that Monica and I are ready to get married yet. You know? I mean, I love her and everything, but seeing Ross and Rachel come out of that chapel was like a like a wake up call that Monica I are moving so fast. You know?\n\nAnd how do I tell her without crushing her? Yeah. Oh, Tell her she's not marriage material. What? Girls say it to me all the time.\n\nAnd believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved. How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon? If it's gonna break his heart, he's gonna think I don't love him anymore. Well, you don't. Yes.\n\nI do. Good. Good. I was just testing you. Hi.\n\nOh, hi. Hi. You know, we were just talking about bacon. No. We were talking about tennis.\n\nTennis is more believable. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hi.\n\nThank you. What? Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or Put her in last night. Nothing nothing, nothing happened last night.\n\nOh, good. Uh-huh. Ross invited us all to watch. What is the matter with you? Rachel, we weren't gonna miss our friends getting married.\n\nWho got married? You did? What? What? We hello?\n\nWe didn't get married? Married? That's Wait. Wait. Wait.\n\nWait. I remember being in a chapel. Oh, they they they would not let us get married when we were that drunk? They let you get married when you're drunk. Most people getting married in Vegas are drunk.\n\nNo. I'm Drunk right now. Oh, I can't have a mimosa with breakfast. I'm on vacation. What are you guys gonna do?\n\nOh, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer. Well, I think I think Ross already has one. Yeah. Yeah. That guy's finally gonna be able to put in that pool.\n\nYeah. Okay. Now this one's free, right, because you paid for the first 2, so you get the 3rd one for free. Laugh it up, but the joke's on you because we don't need to get divorced. K?\n\nWe we're just gonna get an annulment. An annulment? Ross, I don't think surgery is the answer here. Oh, well, that's your thing. What?\n\nYou're vain. You're vain. You know? The you're the guy who gets divorced. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I think that is. That's not my thing. I do not love getting divorced.\n\nYes. You do. This is your 3rd divorce. God, you love divorce so much I'm probably gonna marry it, and then and then it won't work out, so you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk.\n\nYou want to, play some pie gou? Maybe. But I I I kinda think we should Talk about last night. That's a good idea because I I I wanna talk about last night too, and I don't know what Pai Gow is. I see.\n\nSo what do you think we should do? I don't know. I I I know I love you. I know I love you. So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all of marriages thing?\n\nI love you. But that's a good question. Well, last night, we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave that to fate again. I love you.\n\nYes. We don't get married unless there's a sign. Okay? So say, Say you roll another 8? Then there's a definite sign that we should get married.\n\nAlright. 8, we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, we don't get married. Sounds great. Okay. Okay.\n\nHey. We got a shoe dock. Money Blaze. Ready? Ready.\n\nCome on. 8? What happened? Yes. Yes.\n\n8. 8. Easy 8. Wow. I believe I actually rolled an 8.\n\nThat was so unlikely. Well, let's get married, I guess. That wasn't a hard eight. Last night, I rolled a hard eight. That's right.\n\nIt was the wrong kind of eight. No wedding. Damn it. That is so bad. Stop.\n\nWanna go pack? Yeah. We're doing the right thing. Right? Oh, of course, we are.\n\nWe left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married, there would be a clear cut sign. Okay.
