We are very sorry to tell you this, But you, Phoebe, are flaky. That's true. I am flaky. So what you're just, you're just okay with being flaky? Yeah. Totally. Well, then I'm okay with being high maintenance. And yeah. And I am okay with being a pushover. That's great. Good for you guys. I am not my maintenance. I am not a pushover. Who said you were? You did. I'm flaky. I'll say anything. Hey, Gunther. Can you, can you cover for me? I just got an audition. No. I'm leaving to get my hair dyed. Really? I like your natural color. Don't wink at me. Come on, man. It's a great part. Look. Check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend, and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen. Listen. I'm sorry. That seat's saved. That's the whole part? Okay. Maybe he's not his best friend, but okay. I'll see you in an hour. Yeah. I could totally get that part. I'm sorry. The seat is taken. Oh, excuse me. No. No. No. I I didn't mean you. But, you believe me. Don't wink at me. I believed you were saving a seat for someone. So you'd hire me. Right? For what? Alright. Everybody, listen up. The coffee house is gonna be closed for about an hour. What? What? What's the Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's for the kids. Yep. To, keep the kids off drugs. Yep. It's a very important issue, and this must play, boy. I'm sure you all read about it. Hey. Hey. Don't you wanna keep guns away from kids? You said drugs. It's a vicious cycle. Get out. Go. It's my joke. My joke. It's my joke. Joke. You know, I don't think we're gonna settle this. Let's have Monica decide. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, Mon. Come on. Get out of here. Monica. Okay. Okay. You have to help us decide who Ashok this is. Why do I have to decide? Because you're the only one that can be fair. I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world. Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay. Let's go. Alright. Okay. We'll we'll each tell you, how we came up with the joke, and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth, me. Chandler, you go first. Okay. I thought of the joke 2 months ago at lunch with Steve. Oh, wait. Is he the guy that bed at Christmas? Can I finish my story? Do you want me to pick you? See, I would never snap at you like that. Continue. Okay. So Steve said he had to go to the doctor, and Steve's doctor's name is doctor Mumpy. So I said, doctor monkey? And that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up. Are you kidding? Okay. Look. I I study evolution. Remember? Evolution monkey into man. Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm doctor monkey. I'm not arguing with that. Alright. I've heard enough. I have made my decision. You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women And doctors and monkeys. You're right. You you shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit. You should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this Horrible joke upon the world. Now let it go. The joke sucks. It's your joke. It's not. Oh my god. Jean, Laura, there you are. Hi. Hi. Hey. It's baby and Rachel. Hey. Why don't you Tell them, what you're telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance. Monica is a self sufficient together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail And generosity of spirit. Wow. You know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard. Really? No. I've heard better. Wait. Wait. He came up with that himself. Tell him, Chandler. I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again? Look. I am not high maintenance. I am not, Chandler. You're a little high maintenance. You are on my list. I'm sorry, but you're not You're not easygoing, but you're you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good Making you feel better about that, and that's good too. So they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay because I like Maintaining new. I didn't even tell her to say that. Okay. Alright. You're off list. I'm our previous. Phoebe, it's okay that you don't wanna be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend. You know? Suddenly, I find you very attractive. Hey, buddy boy. How'd the audition go? Oh, not good. No. I I didn't get the part and, lost my job here. So Wow. That is a bad audition. Yeah. How how did you lose your job here? Well, I had the audition, but doctor said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So I went anyway, and then he fired me. He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge Marge, well, you've been working here for 2 days. That's not that's not right. Yeah. What are you gonna do? No, Julie. You can't let him get away that. But you know what? I'm not gonna let him get away with that. I'm gonna say something to no. I really shouldn't say anything. No. I should Say something to him, bitch. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair Then you have to wire him what? He can have his job back. That's right. He can have his job back. Glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey. Got your job back. That's great. Thanks, Rach. Yeah. Pretty nice. Yeah. Who's a pushover? Wait. You're in my seat.

Joey, what's going on? Why why didn't you tell us you work here? Well, It's kind of embarrassing. You know?\n\nI mean, I was an actor, and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction. So is your Don't wink at me. Apron, you're wearing it like a cape. I mean, the job's easy and the money's good.\n\nYou know? And I guess I'm gonna be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid Right? Just feel kinda weird serving you guys. You know?\n\nAw, it's actually crazy. Joey, come on. I did it, and it was fine. Yeah. Why would it be weird?\n\nHey, Joey. Can I get some coffee? Okay. I guess it doesn't seem that weird. Seriously, I I asked you before.\n\nYou still haven't gotten it. So now it's weird again. I think it's great that you work here. You're gonna lot of money, and here is your 1st tip. Don't eat yellow snow.\n\n215 Coffeehouse. Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom to. Let me tell you about a couple things I learned while working at the coffee house.\n\nFirst of all, the customer is always right. A smile Goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you, sneezemuffin. Thanks, rage. Hey.\n\nLook. You guys are just terrific, you know? And how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers? It's all about turnover. Joey.\n\nSeriously, can I get my coffee? I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin. Phoebe, we would like to talk to you for a second.\n\nOkay. So Maybe I am a little high maintenance, and maybe Rachel is is a little bit of a a pushover. But you know what we decided that you are? Yes. We are very sorry to tell you this, But you, Phoebe, are flaky.\n\nThat's true. I am flaky. So what you're just, you're just okay with being flaky? Yeah. Totally.\n\nWell, then I'm okay with being high maintenance. And yeah. And I am okay with being a pushover. That's great. Good for you guys.\n\nI am not my maintenance. I am not a pushover. Who said you were? You did. I'm flaky.\n\nI'll say anything. Hey, Gunther. Can you, can you cover for me? I just got an audition. No.\n\nI'm leaving to get my hair dyed. Really? I like your natural color. Don't wink at me. Come on, man.\n\nIt's a great part. Look. Check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend, and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen.\n\nListen. I'm sorry. That seat's saved. That's the whole part? Okay.\n\nMaybe he's not his best friend, but okay. I'll see you in an hour. Yeah. I could totally get that part. I'm sorry.\n\nThe seat is taken. Oh, excuse me. No. No. No.\n\nI I didn't mean you. But, you believe me. Don't wink at me. I believed you were saving a seat for someone. So you'd hire me.\n\nRight? For what? Alright. Everybody, listen up. The coffee house is gonna be closed for about an hour.\n\nWhat? What? What's the Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's for the kids.\n\nYep. To, keep the kids off drugs. Yep. It's a very important issue, and this must play, boy. I'm sure you all read about it.\n\nHey. Hey. Don't you wanna keep guns away from kids? You said drugs. It's a vicious cycle.\n\nGet out. Go. It's my joke. My joke. It's my joke.\n\nJoke. You know, I don't think we're gonna settle this. Let's have Monica decide. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nHey, Mon. Come on. Get out of here. Monica. Okay.\n\nOkay. You have to help us decide who Ashok this is. Why do I have to decide? Because you're the only one that can be fair. I can't be fair.\n\nYou're my boyfriend. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm your brother. We're family.\n\nThat's the most important thing in the world. Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay. Let's go.\n\nAlright. Okay. We'll we'll each tell you, how we came up with the joke, and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth, me. Chandler, you go first. Okay.\n\nI thought of the joke 2 months ago at lunch with Steve. Oh, wait. Is he the guy that bed at Christmas? Can I finish my story? Do you want me to pick you?\n\nSee, I would never snap at you like that. Continue. Okay. So Steve said he had to go to the doctor, and Steve's doctor's name is doctor Mumpy. So I said, doctor monkey?\n\nAnd that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up. Are you kidding? Okay. Look. I I study evolution.\n\nRemember? Evolution monkey into man. Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm doctor monkey. I'm not arguing with that.\n\nAlright. I've heard enough. I have made my decision. You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women And doctors and monkeys.\n\nYou're right. You you shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit. You should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this Horrible joke upon the world. Now let it go. The joke sucks.\n\nIt's your joke. It's not. Oh my god. Jean, Laura, there you are. Hi.\n\nHi. Hey. It's baby and Rachel. Hey. Why don't you Tell them, what you're telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance.\n\nMonica is a self sufficient together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail And generosity of spirit. Wow. You know what?\n\nThat is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard. Really? No. I've heard better. Wait.\n\nWait. He came up with that himself. Tell him, Chandler. I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?\n\nLook. I am not high maintenance. I am not, Chandler. You're a little high maintenance. You are on my list.\n\nI'm sorry, but you're not You're not easygoing, but you're you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good Making you feel better about that, and that's good too. So they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay because I like Maintaining new. I didn't even tell her to say that. Okay.\n\nAlright. You're off list. I'm our previous. Phoebe, it's okay that you don't wanna be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend. You know?\n\nSuddenly, I find you very attractive. Hey, buddy boy. How'd the audition go? Oh, not good. No.\n\nI I didn't get the part and, lost my job here. So Wow. That is a bad audition. Yeah. How how did you lose your job here?\n\nWell, I had the audition, but doctor said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So I went anyway, and then he fired me. He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge Marge, well, you've been working here for 2 days. That's not that's not right. Yeah.\n\nWhat are you gonna do? No, Julie. You can't let him get away that. But you know what? I'm not gonna let him get away with that.\n\nI'm gonna say something to no. I really shouldn't say anything.
