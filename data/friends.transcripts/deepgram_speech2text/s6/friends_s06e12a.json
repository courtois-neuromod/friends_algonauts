Well, she's not gonna find them lying in the grass that. Oh, yeah. Remember the days when you used to go the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over. Yeah. See now see now, I would date this girl. She's cute. She's outdoorsy. You know, when she knows how to build fire. I mean, that's gotta come in handy. Hey. I got a question. Mhmm. If you had to pick 1 of us to date, who would it be?

The doctor is a monkey. And monkeys can't write out prescriptions. Pictures. You are not allowed to laugh at my joke. Your joke? Well, I think the half would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for $100. So you stole my joke it, and you stole my money. You know, I was gonna stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer. Her. Well, she is gonna know that you stole the joke. Oh, what are you gonna do?

I'm gonna get a joke journal, you know, and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes. It's a good idea. Mhmm. You know what's a bad idea? Picking Rachel. That's right. Did you hear something? Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts. I thought it's coming from the living room. I finished my book. Hey, you guys. People. Hey. Oh, don't you guys look cute? You guys make such a cute couple? Hanukkah, what are you doing? Nothing. I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember when when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny. Yes. It was kinda funny. It wasn't funny at all. Why you do that? Why why didn't you pick me? Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you. It's just, you know, you're just kinda high maintenance. Okay. Let's go to lunch. That is completely True.

Oh, oh, no. You didn't.\n\nI did. Oh, yes. I did. I told it to Dan at at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard. Hey.\n\nTell Dan thanks. What? I'm sorry. I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.\n\nMonica, you. You remember me telling you that joke. Right? No. Seriously?\n\nWell, you tell a lot of jokes. Them. Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But, hey. If if it makes you feel any better, they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets this credit.\n\nRight? Yeah. I guess. Hey, guys. Hey, Joey.\n\nClint Wood printed my joke. What? No. No. It's mine.\n\nIt's my joke. You can call them. They'll tell you. It's my joke. It's my joke.\n\nPeople. Woah. Woah. Jokes?

Did your cable go out? No.\n\nNo. That's BH 1. I gotta tell you. The music these kids listen to today, it's like a lot of noise to me. I don't know.\n\nJoey, why is your cable out? Oh, because I, haven't really paid the bill. If you need money, would you it. Please please just let me loan you some money. No, Chan.\n\nLook. Forget about it. Okay? Look. I I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out.\n\nGod. Woah. I know. Yeah. Look.\n\nLook. I can handle it. Alright? I can, like, listen to the radio. And, Ross gave me this great book.\n\nYou wanna see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place? Sure. Paid your phone bill? Not so much. Hey.\n\nIt's only you. Wait. Wait. What are you doing? We are looking at a Playboy.\n\nOh, I wanna look too. Yikes. So do you think that these pictures are are they trying to tell a story? Oh, well, yeah. Sure.\n\nI mean, like, in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes. So so she rides naked on the horse. She's crying out. Where are they? Where are they?\n\nWell, she's not gonna find them lying in the grass that. Oh, yeah. Remember the days when you used to go the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over. Yeah. See now see now, I would date this girl.\n\nShe's cute. She's outdoorsy. You know, when she knows how to build fire. I mean, that's gotta come in handy. Hey.\n\nI got a question. Mhmm. If you had to pick 1 of us to date, who would it be? I don't know. Me neither.\n\nRachel. What? I don't know. Me neither. You know, you forget how many great songs.\n\nHard hands. Yeah. You know, Barracuda was the 1st song I learned to play on the keyboard. Them. So you heard it.\n\nYou repeated it. So that must mean you wrote it. Oh, you guys with this joke. Look. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got this.\n\nYou didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey. And monkeys can't write out prescriptions. Pictures. You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.\n\nYour joke? Well, I think the half would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for $100. So you stole my joke it, and you stole my money. You know, I was gonna stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer. Her.\n\nWell, she is gonna know that you stole the joke. Oh, what are you gonna do? Follow me down there? Yeah. Well, I'm not gonna go now anyway.\n\nOkay. Here we go, man. Oh. Donta? I can't pay for this right now because, I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like, paying for stuff.\n\nSo, Well, if you want, you can work here. I don't know. It's, it's just See, I was a regular on a soap opera. You know? And and to go from that to this, it's just just And and, plus, I, you know, I don't have to wait on all my friends.\n\nOkay. But the money's good. Plus, you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want. What? Flexible hours.\n\nOh, maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone? She picked Rachel. Him. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious.\n\nShe picked Rachel. He he took my joke. He he just took it. It's wrong. You know what else is wrong?\n\nPhoebe picking Rachel. You know who else picked Rachel? Ross. You know what else Ross did? He stole my joke.\n\nYou know what? I'm gonna get a joke journal, you know, and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes. It's a good idea. Mhmm. You know what's a bad idea?\n\nPicking Rachel. That's right. Did you hear something? Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts. I thought it's coming from the living room.\n\nI finished my book. Hey, you guys. People. Hey. Oh, don't you guys look cute?\n\nYou guys make such a cute couple? Hanukkah, what are you doing? Nothing. I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day.
