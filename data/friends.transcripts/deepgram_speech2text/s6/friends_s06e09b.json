And so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window. What? Why did you do that? I don't know. This was the first name that that popped into my head. I'm I'm sorry. I didn't I didn't think it didn't matter. How How could it not matter? How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you you'd be living with my sister? What about all that friends forever stuff? I don't know. I I was all high. Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned. Your parents I caught Ross smoking pot in college, and he blamed it on me. Ross, I can't believe you'd do that. The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me. Okay? So will you fix this? Okay. Okay. I'll tell them it wasn't Chandler who got high. K. Now who should I say it was? You. It's not like it's a big deal. You you don't still do it or anything. Alright. Alright. Now now who should I say tricked me into doing Nobody. You're gonna go out there and tell them exactly what happened. Really? Yes. Okay. Good. Oh, wait. Is there anything else I should know? No. Oh, yeah. You microwaved a bunch of my dad's records. Why? Evidently, you you weren't very good at handling your high. Dad, Please don't pick your teeth out here. Alright? And and if you're gonna put your feet up, what did you say? Leave him alone. Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers? And that they're gonna be drinking a lot. No. I did, but tell me again because it's so romantic. You're whipping so slow. Can't you do it any faster? Joey, come Come on. I don't wanna make any mistakes. Alright? This is the only dessert. And if I screw it up, everybody's gonna be like, oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle? So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle, and you just worry about eating it. Alright? Oh, I am. Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will. Okay. Fine. Ross, can I talk to you for a second? Oh, Can it wait a second, Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No. It can't. Okay. Okay. Look. I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert. What? What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not Truth day? Look. When everyone eats that that banana meat thing, they're all gonna make fun of her. You don't want that? Okay. Okay. We'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That that way, no one makes fun of her, and we still get to go to sweet potato pie. Dude, they're not objects. Just kidding. I'll talk to them. You just back. Hey, Rach. Can I talk to you outside for a sec? Okay. What's up, bros? So, Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us. Yeah. And, you look nice today. Oh, no. No, Ross. Don't do this. What? I just I don't think us getting back together is a good idea. I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know holidays can be rough. You know what? And it's probably really Hard for you to to be alone right now. You're alone. No. I I live with Phoebe. I mean, you're alone. Alone. And I just it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry. Oh, well. Can't blame a guy for trying. Okay. And, if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned some things in acting class. Try, rubbing your stomach For, I was saying, and, oh, oh, smiling. Okay. Yeah. I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore. Rachel, there you are. Come on. Let's serve that dessert already. Joey, You're gonna have to stop rushing me. You know what? You don't get any dessert. Really? No. I'm just kidding. I would never I'll do that to you. Okay, everybody. It's trifle time. So now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it? It sure is. Wow. So then did you make it with beef or eggplant? Beef. I can't have any. You know? I don't eat beef. Oh, wow. Alright, Monica. I want you to have the first taste. Really? Alright. You only got whipped cream in there. You gotta take a bite with all the layers. Okay. Oh, You want you to drop to pee? Well? It's good. Really? How good? It's so good that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it. I think we should have everyone taste how good it is, Especially Ross. Mhmm. Yeah. This is so good that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert. I've gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good This is from Monica's room. I'll help you dial. I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror As I eat it. Okay. Now what was that all about? Is it does it not taste good? Let me try it. Put no no. So good. Maybe Jam will have some left. It tastes like Deet. I like it. Are you kidding? What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Good. So a bird just grabbed it and then and then tried to fly away with it And then just dropped it on the street? Yes. But if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it. Rachel, come here. Okay. I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack. Phoebe, do I wanna hear this? I don't know. Let's see. So okay. I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left because he had to go fight a fire. And, so, okay, I went to a nightclub, and I saw him making out with a girl. Oh my god. He dreamed cheated on you. Yeah. But then Jacques Cousteau came, and he kicked his ass for betraying me. So cool. Then He took me diving, and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me. And, please, that is not gonna happen. Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today. 5 minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. No. Nothing. Well, not nothing. I am still a woman. Ross? Let's go. Oh, yeah. About telling mom and dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter. Right. You know what? That's it. You've had your chance. What? Mom, dad, Ross smoked pot in college. What? You are such a tattletale. Mom, dad, you remember that that time you walked in my room and Smelled marijuana? Yes. Well, I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot, but it was me. I'm sorry. It was you? Yeah. And, dad, Chandler didn't melt your records. Ross did. Is that true? And, dad, you know that mailman that you got fired? Didn't steal your Playboys. Ross did. Yeah. Well, hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing. Monica did. Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year. Monica and Chandler are living together. Boss married Rachel in Vegas and got divorced again. I love Jacques Cousteau. I wasn't supposed to put beef in a trifle. I wanna go. That's a lot of information to get in 30 seconds. Alright. Joey, if you wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no. You weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, Why you felt you had to hide the fact that you're in an important relationship is beyond me. And we kind of figured about the porch When? Ross, drugs, divorced again. What happened, son? I I, I got tricked into all those things. Chandler. You've been Ross's best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problem. And now you've taken on Monica as well. Well, I don't know what to say. You're a wonderful human being. Thank you. No. Thank you. Monica and Ross, I don't know what I'm gonna do about the 2 of you. I'll talk to them. You guys, it was bananas, cream, and beef. I I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad. Well, actually, I I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom. No. It isn't. I ain't that. And we left ours at Monica's bedroom. Nope. Got it, and got yours too. So, Chandler, are you gonna stick with that bird story? It was a big bird. Swooped right in there. Hi. Oh, Janine. I know. Oh, it's not over, is it? Yeah. We all got depressed. You know, the holidays and everything, we're alone. Yeah. Well, at least you have Joey, but Ross is really alone. Well, you're always welcome here. This is my mom and my dad. This is Janine. Hi. Nice to meet you. I think we've already met. Really? I live across the hall.

my bedroom, and my parents walked in and smelled it. And so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window. What? Why did you do that? I don't know.\n\nThis was the first name that that popped into my head. I'm I'm sorry. I didn't I didn't think it didn't matter. How How could it not matter? How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you you'd be living with my sister?\n\nWhat about all that friends forever stuff? I don't know. I I was all high. Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned. Your parents I caught Ross smoking pot in college, and he blamed it on me.\n\nRoss, I can't believe you'd do that. The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me. Okay? So will you fix this? Okay.\n\nOkay. I'll tell them it wasn't Chandler who got high. K. Now who should I say it was? You.\n\nIt's not like it's a big deal. You you don't still do it or anything. Alright. Alright. Now now who should I say tricked me into doing Nobody.\n\nYou're gonna go out there and tell them exactly what happened. Really? Yes. Okay. Good.\n\nOh, wait. Is there anything else I should know? No. Oh, yeah. You microwaved a bunch of my dad's records.\n\nWhy? Evidently, you you weren't very good at handling your high. Dad, Please don't pick your teeth out here. Alright? And and if you're gonna put your feet up, what did you say?\n\nLeave him alone. Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers? And that they're gonna be drinking a lot. No.\n\nI did, but tell me again because it's so romantic. You're whipping so slow. Can't you do it any faster? Joey, come Come on. I don't wanna make any mistakes.\n\nAlright? This is the only dessert. And if I screw it up, everybody's gonna be like, oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle? So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle, and you just worry about eating it. Alright?\n\nOh, I am. Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will. Okay. Fine. Ross, can I talk to you for a second?\n\nOh, Can it wait a second, Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No. It can't. Okay.\n\nOkay. Look. I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert. What? What is with everybody?\n\nIt's Thanksgiving, not Truth day? Look. When everyone eats that that banana meat thing, they're all gonna make fun of her. You don't want that? Okay.\n\nOkay. We'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That that way, no one makes fun of her, and we still get to go to sweet potato pie. Dude, they're not objects. Just kidding.\n\nI'll talk to them. You just back. Hey, Rach. Can I talk to you outside for a sec? Okay.\n\nWhat's up, bros? So, Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us. Yeah. And, you look nice today.\n\nOh, no. No, Ross. Don't do this. What? I just I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.\n\nI thought this might happen today. Ross, I know holidays can be rough. You know what? And it's probably really Hard for you to to be alone right now. You're alone.\n\nNo. I I live with Phoebe. I mean, you're alone. Alone. And I just it's just not the time for us.\n\nI'm sorry. Oh, well. Can't blame a guy for trying. Okay. And, if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned some things in acting class.\n\nTry, rubbing your stomach For, I was saying, and, oh, oh, smiling. Okay. Yeah. I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore. Rachel, there you are.\n\nCome on. Let's serve that dessert already. Joey, You're gonna have to stop rushing me. You know what? You don't get any dessert.\n\nReally? No. I'm just kidding. I would never I'll do that to you. Okay, everybody.\n\nIt's trifle time. So now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it? It sure is. Wow. So then did you make it with beef or eggplant?\n\nBeef. I can't have any. You know? I don't eat beef. Oh, wow.\n\nAlright, Monica. I want you to have the first taste. Really? Alright. You only got whipped cream in there.\n\nYou gotta take a bite with all the layers. Okay. Oh, You want you to drop to pee? Well? It's good.\n\nReally? How good? It's so good that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it. I think we should have everyone taste how good it is, Especially Ross. Mhmm.\n\nYeah. This is so good that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert. I've gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good This is from Monica's room. I'll help you dial. I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror As I eat it.\n\nOkay. Now what was that all about? Is it does it not taste good? Let me try it. Put no no.\n\nSo good. Maybe Jam will have some left. It tastes like Deet. I like it. Are you kidding?\n\nWhat's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good.\n\nMeat? Good. So a bird just grabbed it and then and then tried to fly away with it And then just dropped it on the street? Yes. But if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.\n\nRachel, come here. Okay. I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack. Phoebe, do I wanna hear this? I don't know.\n\nLet's see. So okay. I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left because he had to go fight a fire. And, so, okay, I went to a nightclub, and I saw him making out with a girl. Oh my god.\n\nHe dreamed cheated on you. Yeah. But then Jacques Cousteau came, and he kicked his ass for betraying me. So cool. Then He took me diving, and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me.\n\nAnd, please, that is not gonna happen. Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today. 5 minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. No. Nothing.\n\nWell, not nothing. I am still a woman. Ross? Let's go. Oh, yeah.\n\nAbout telling mom and dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter. Right. You know what? That's it. You've had your chance.\n\nWhat? Mom, dad, Ross smoked pot in college. What? You are such a tattletale. Mom, dad, you remember that that time you walked in my room and Smelled marijuana?\n\nYes. Well, I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot, but it was me. I'm sorry. It was you? Yeah.\n\nAnd, dad, Chandler didn't melt your records. Ross did. Is that true? And, dad, you know that mailman that you got fired? Didn't steal your Playboys.\n\nRoss did. Yeah. Well, hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing. Monica did. Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year.\n\nMonica and Chandler are living together. Boss married Rachel in Vegas and got divorced again. I love Jacques Cousteau. I wasn't supposed to put beef in a trifle. I wanna go.\n\nThat's a lot of information to get in 30 seconds. Alright. Joey, if you wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no. You weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle.\n\nIt did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, Why you felt you had to hide the fact that you're in an important relationship is beyond me. And we kind of figured about the porch When? Ross, drugs, divorced again.\n\nWhat happened, son? I I, I got tricked into all those things. Chandler. You've been Ross's best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problem. And now you've taken on Monica as well.\n\nWell, I don't know what to say. You're a wonderful human being. Thank you. No. Thank you.\n\nMonica and Ross, I don't know what I'm gonna do about the 2 of you. I'll talk to them. You guys, it was bananas, cream, and beef. I I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad. Well, actually, I I didn't eat mine.\n\nIt's still in the bathroom. No. It isn't. I ain't that. And we left ours at Monica's bedroom.\n\nNope. Got it, and got yours too. So, Chandler, are you gonna stick with that bird story? It was a big bird. Swooped right in there.\n\nHi. Oh, Janine. I know. Oh, it's not over, is it? Yeah.\n\nWe all got depressed. You know, the holidays and everything, we're alone. Yeah. Well, at least you have Joey, but Ross is really alone. Well, you're always welcome here.\n\nThis is my mom and my dad. This is Janine. Hi. Nice to meet you. I think we've already met.\n\nReally? I live across the hall.
