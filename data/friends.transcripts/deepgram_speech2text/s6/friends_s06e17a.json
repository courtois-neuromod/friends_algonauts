Remember when I had a monkey? Yeah. Yeah. What what was I thinking? Hey. So what's with the 20% tip? Did I do something wrong? 20% is a pretty generous tip, Joe. You know what's more generous than that? 50%. You know what's even more generous than that? I see where you're going. What's up with the greed, Joe? Alright. Look. I'm sorry, you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new headshots made, and they're really expensive. You know? I'm down to, like, 3. Actually, 2 because one of them, like, kind of blackened in some teeth. Why'd I do that? Isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here? Or, you know, I used to beg for money. Of course, it helps if you've got, you know, a little of this going on. Wow. Still have it. Yeah. Ago? Oh, wait. Wait. Don't you have an audition today? Yeah. Maybe you'll get that job. Oh, Oh, wait a minute. I used to get medical experiments done on me all the time. Finally, an explanation. Oh, no. I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff. Remember? Let's see. Well, I don't wanna donate sperm again. Really prefer doing that at the home history? Oh, oh, maybe they want, like, some of my blood or or spit or something. Joey. Yeah. What What'd I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working? Do it. That guy's been waiting for his coffee for 10 minutes. He's complained about you 3 times. Well, where was I? No one told you that was monk? In Hi. Hey. Hey. What have you guys been up to? Oh, We went to a self defense class today. Wow. Yeah. Kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of you. Takes it out of you. So now we can kick anybody's ass. After 1 class? I don't think so. What? You wanna see me self defend myself? Go over there and pretend you're a sexual predator. Go on. I dare you. Of course, you could defend yourself from an attack you know is coming. That's not enough. Look. I studied karate tag for a long time? And there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi. Isn't that a kind of sushi? No. It's a concept. Yeah. It Hey. As it is, it's freshwater heel. But maybe it means that too. Oh, I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now. You know? Fine? Get attacked. I don't even care. Come on, Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is. Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you? You mean in case someone's trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish? Ago? All I'm saying is it's one thing being prepared for an attack against, like, each other? Whole another story being prepared for an attack. I don't know. Like, surprise. Alright. You knew that was coming, but that doesn't mean you have Unagi. Oh, you know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half hour. Hey. Hey. Is Monica here? No. Oh, okay. Look. I need your help. I don't know where to get her for Valentine's Day. Well, Valentine's Day was 2 weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar. She was working on Valentine's Day, so we're celebrating it tonight. Oh, hey. Why Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas? Oh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea. Yeah. And, of course, crotchless panties. Well, as appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that. We promised we'd make each other gifts this year. Oh, ago? Nice. You can't make crotchless panties? You take you take a pair of scissors, and you just cut Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So Making things, that sounds so much fun. Yeah. I thought so too until I paper mache'd one of my eyes shut. I love paper mache. What did you make? I made a flar. Streak? What is that? Nothing. So what are you gonna do? Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I to take credit for? Oh, I have. I have. But, I started making these little sock bunnies. Oh, for crying out loud. Hey. Wait a minute. That That is my sock. Now it's your little bunny Okay. This this actually is a fly from popcorn. Hi. Hey, honey. Can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts? Oh, yeah.

That's too bad. Kinda been saving up. Are you sure there's no studies I could participate in? Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up. Thanks. But this one starts now. Oh, that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It's a twin study. That's $2,000. Sorry. And, well, how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionist. We already got the results back on that one, and they're not good. It was cut. Oh, yes. The last. The last tantrum. What the hell was that? A lesson in the importance of Oh, you're a freak. Perhaps. Now I'm curious. At what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass? Alright.

I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me? Hey. Chandler, I sensed it was you. What? Unagi. I'm always aware. K. Are you aware that unagi is an eel? What's up? I can't figure out what to make Monica. Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes? I'm going crazy. Okay? Do you have anything around here that looks homemade? Oh, you know what? She'd she'd love this. It's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the 6th grade. Yeah. I guess I could use that. I could say, your love sends me to the moon. Yeah. Except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you you could write, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. I mean, I can't give this to her. Why not?

I don't think so. What?\n\nYou wanna see me self defend myself? Go over there and pretend you're a sexual predator. Go on. I dare you. Of course, you could defend yourself from an attack you know is coming.\n\nThat's not enough. Look. I studied karate tag for a long time? And there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi.\n\nIsn't that a kind of sushi? No. It's a concept. Yeah. It Hey.\n\nAs it is, it's freshwater heel. But maybe it means that too. Oh, I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now. You know? Fine?\n\nGet attacked. I don't even care. Come on, Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is.\n\nUnagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you? You mean in case someone's trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish? Ago?\n\nAll I'm saying is it's one thing being prepared for an attack against, like, each other? Whole another story being prepared for an attack. I don't know. Like, surprise. Alright.\n\nYou knew that was coming, but that doesn't mean you have Unagi. Oh, you know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half hour. Hey. Hey.\n\nIs Monica here? No. Oh, okay. Look. I need your help.\n\nI don't know where to get her for Valentine's Day. Well, Valentine's Day was 2 weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar. She was working on Valentine's Day, so we're celebrating it tonight. Oh, hey. Why Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?\n\nOh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea. Yeah. And, of course, crotchless panties. Well, as appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that. We promised we'd make each other gifts this year.\n\nOh, ago? Nice. You can't make crotchless panties? You take you take a pair of scissors, and you just cut Yeah. Yeah.\n\nYeah. So Making things, that sounds so much fun. Yeah. I thought so too until I paper mache'd one of my eyes shut. I love paper mache.\n\nWhat did you make? I made a flar. Streak? What is that? Nothing.\n\nSo what are you gonna do? Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I to take credit for? Oh, I have. I have. But, I started making these little sock bunnies.\n\nOh, for crying out loud. Hey. Wait a minute. That That is my sock. Now it's your little bunny Okay.\n\nThis this actually is a fly from popcorn. Hi. Hey, honey. Can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts? Oh, yeah.\n\nDo we have to make the entire thing? Yes. Why? Did you did you forget to make yours? Of course of course not.\n\nI just have to, Go over to the place where I I made it and then and pick pick it up. Okay. Okay. I can't wait. It's gonna be the best Valentine's Day ever.\n\nThey would make the presents. Make the presents. What? I'm just so excited to make the presents. Hi.\n\nI'm Joe Oh, Tribbiani, and with all due respect, I'd like to donate some fluids. We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now? That's too bad. Kinda been saving up. Are you sure there's no studies I could participate in?\n\nWell, here's a schedule of what's coming up. Thanks. But this one starts now. Oh, that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It's a twin study.\n\nThat's $2,000. Sorry. And, well, how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionist. We already got the results back on that one, and they're not good.\n\nIt was cut. Oh, yes. The last. The last tantrum. What the hell was that?\n\nA lesson in the importance of Oh, you're a freak. Perhaps. Now I'm curious. At what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass? Alright.\n\nSo we weren't prepared. I'm sorry. I had to take such Drastic measures to make my point, but I look. I just want you guys to be safe. Danger.\n\nUh-huh. $2,000 is a lot of money. Wow. I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?\n\nHey. Chandler, I sensed it was you. What? Unagi. I'm always aware.\n\nK. Are you aware that unagi is an eel? What's up? I can't figure out what to make Monica. Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes?\n\nI'm going crazy. Okay? Do you have anything around here that looks homemade? Oh, you know what? She'd she'd love this.\n\nIt's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the 6th grade. Yeah. I guess I could use that. I could say, your love sends me to the moon.\n\nYeah. Except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you you could write, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. I mean, I can't give this to her. Why not?\n\nBecause it says captain Ross on the side, And it says I hate Monica on the bottom.", "paragraphs": [{"sentences": [{"text": "Hey.", "start": 6.08, "end": 6.3199997}, {"text": "Remember
