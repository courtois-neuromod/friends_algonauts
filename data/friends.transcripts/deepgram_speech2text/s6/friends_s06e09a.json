I'll make Thanksgiving dinner. You don't have to beg. I didn't beg. Hey. Hey. Just ask once. You could beg, you know. Monica said I could make dessert this year. You're gonna cook something? Hey. I cook. Offering people is not cooking. Are you sure Monica said you could make something this year? Because I remember her saying in 2 years. You said in 2 years. Right? No. I I promised her. But, Rach, are you sure you do wanna start out with something as big as Thanksgiving dinner? I mean, maybe you wanna try a little Thanksgiving breakfast, Maybe Thanksgiving snack. What? You guys, I can do this. Remember I made those peanut butter cookies? I don't know what you guys are so worried about. Cooking is easy. You just follow the recipe. If it says boil 2 cups of salt, you just boil 2 cups of salt. Okay. Great. Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner? Sydney Poache. Hi, miss Rachel. No. My parents. Oh, that's great. They haven't seen the place since I moved in. Yeah. And, you know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great. Was thinking we'd eat around 4. Why can't I tell them that we live together? Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? Why haven't you told them? Well, I was going to. I I I really was. But, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't. Why haven't you told them? Wouldn't they be happy? So dinner in the kitchen, around 4. I'll see you then. Why wouldn't they be Well, because mainly, they don't like you. I'm sorry. What? Why? Why? Maybe because you used to be aloof or or that you're really sarcastic or that, you know, you joke around all the time or that you take off your clothes and you throw them on the couch. Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me? Look. I know that I should've told them, and I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry. You know what? It'll be okay. It'll be okay because when they come over, I will be all charming. I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell them. You really think that'll work? Hey. I can be pretty charming, babe. Won you over, didn't I? I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk. Hey. Oh, good. Ross, your Parents like me. Right? Yes. Of course, they like you. Well, Monica just told me that they don't. Yeah. They don't like you. Do you know why? I don't know. Maybe it's because you're really sarcastic, or or, I don't know, maybe it's because you, Well, people don't know. They shouldn't just guess. This is great. Another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for. Maybe I give thanks for you shutting up, Maybe I can thanks by taking my PlayStation over to my new apartment. Well, maybe I love you. Hey, man. Hi. Hi. Hey, guys. No. I don't wanna play video games. Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving? Yeah. Yeah. Why? What's up? Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come. For real? No. Then you should go to Chalmers because none of us knows how to cook. We'll probably just end up drinking all day. No. No. We go to your lunch. Yeah. So we we we have to stop across the hall because it's my sister. But, you know, actually, growing up with a sister It was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah. You you should tell your friends that. Okay. How you got 3 women to marry you, I'll never know. Hey, Mon. Look. I'm melting butter. That's great, Rach. And now I have the cooking skills of a hot day. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Cheek it out. Yeah. For my dessert, I have chosen to make a traditional English trifle. Wow. That sounds great. And what are you making Monica, you know, in case Rachel's dessert is so good that I eat all of it. There's none left for anybody Hell, uh-huh. Nothing? Nothing? No, sweetie. I trust you. So if I if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert? You're not gonna mess it out. Wow. Monica, I love that. You really have faith in me. Thank Q. Technical question. How do you know when, the butter is done? Well, it's done about 2 minutes before it looks like that. Hey. Hey. Oh, look. The food smells great, man. Yeah. And the place looks so nice. And hey. Hey. Happy everybody. Thanksgiving. Well, this has been great. See you. Where are you going?

That is some of her friends. Yeah. Her dancer friends? Yes. Right? All of our hot dancer friends are gonna be there, and we we we we we we we we Dude, we were good. You're not gonna go anywhere. You said you're gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here. Yeah. And and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgiving y. But but it is. It's Just like the 1st Thanksgiving when the Indians and the pilgrims, sat down to dinner. Yeah. Yeah. And then the Indians taught the pilgrims what it meant to be hot In the new world. Fellas, I really think you should stay here. You're just jealous because you can't go. That is so not true. Hello, everybody. Hi. Hey. Mom. Hey. That's Look. Look who it is. It's Chandler. Hi, yes. Of course. Hello, Jennifer. Mister and missus Geller, you look wonderful. It is great to have you here. Let us take Top your coats. Woah. Is no one out there? No. Monica, all this food looks wonderful. You should think about doing this For a living. Okay. I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point. Dan, Chandler was just laughing at your joke. My joke wasn't funny. Well, Chandler laughs at everything. That that's one of the great things about him. Well Great. Great. I just remembered. I had a dream about mister Geller last night. Really? Yeah. I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building, and he was so brave and so strong. And it's making me look at him totally differently. You know? I mean, he used to be just, you know, Jack Eller, Monica and Ross's dad, and now he's He's Jack Geller, dream hug. I don't know. You know, to me, he'll always be Jack Geller walks in while you're changing. You know, dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends. Yes. I know. Now Ross sure is a great guy. You know, I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father. I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do? He's a headliner of a gay burlesque show. Rach, you're killing us here. Will you serve the dessert already? These drunken dancers are waiting. Look at it. Isn't it beautiful? Yeah. Yeah. What is it? It's a trifle. It's got all of these layers. 1st, there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, Which I make from scratch. Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, and then a little bit more Custer and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top. What what was the one right before bananas? The beef? Yeah. That was weird to me too. But then, you know, I I thought, well, there's minced meat pie. I mean, that's an English dessert. These people just Very strange things in their food. You know? Oh, by the way, can I borrow some rum from your place? Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Okay. And while I'm gone, don't you boys sneak a taste. Hey. Beef in a dessert that no. No. No. There is no way. I know. And only 1 layer of jam? What is up with that? Oh my god. The pages are stuck together. Chandler. Oh my god. She she made half an English trifle and Half a shepherd's pie. Man, now she's gonna start all over. We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world. No. No. We will. We'll we just won't tell her. She messed up. Just let her serve the beef custard thing? Yeah. It'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story. Vomiting stories are funny, I guess. Joey, god. Your apartment is like a 100 degrees. Did did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear? No. Still not hot enough. Rachel. Yeah. Okay. Look at him. Look at those strong hands.

You guys ever wonder why they call it Thanksgiving? Okay. Hey, Monica. You're you're doing Thanksgiving next week.\n\nRight? Because, Carol's taking Ben to her parents' place in Florida. Okay. Okay. I'll make Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nYou don't have to beg. I didn't beg. Hey. Hey. Just ask once.\n\nYou could beg, you know. Monica said I could make dessert this year. You're gonna cook something? Hey. I cook.\n\nOffering people is not cooking. Are you sure Monica said you could make something this year? Because I remember her saying in 2 years. You said in 2 years. Right?\n\nNo. I I promised her. But, Rach, are you sure you do wanna start out with something as big as Thanksgiving dinner? I mean, maybe you wanna try a little Thanksgiving breakfast, Maybe Thanksgiving snack. What?\n\nYou guys, I can do this. Remember I made those peanut butter cookies? I don't know what you guys are so worried about. Cooking is easy. You just follow the recipe.\n\nIf it says boil 2 cups of salt, you just boil 2 cups of salt. Okay. Great. Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?\n\nSydney Poache. Hi, miss Rachel. No. My parents. Oh, that's great.\n\nThey haven't seen the place since I moved in. Yeah. And, you know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great. Was thinking we'd eat around 4. Why can't I tell them that we live together?\n\nBecause they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? Why haven't you told them? Well, I was going to. I I I really was.\n\nBut, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't. Why haven't you told them? Wouldn't they be happy? So dinner in the kitchen, around 4. I'll see you then.\n\nWhy wouldn't they be Well, because mainly, they don't like you. I'm sorry. What? Why? Why?\n\nMaybe because you used to be aloof or or that you're really sarcastic or that, you know, you joke around all the time or that you take off your clothes and you throw them on the couch. Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me? Look. I know that I should've told them, and I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.\n\nYou know what? It'll be okay. It'll be okay because when they come over, I will be all charming. I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell them. You really think that'll work?\n\nHey. I can be pretty charming, babe. Won you over, didn't I? I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk. Hey.\n\nOh, good. Ross, your Parents like me. Right? Yes. Of course, they like you.\n\nWell, Monica just told me that they don't. Yeah. They don't like you. Do you know why? I don't know.\n\nMaybe it's because you're really sarcastic, or or, I don't know, maybe it's because you, Well, people don't know. They shouldn't just guess. This is great. Another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for. Maybe I give thanks for you shutting up, Maybe I can thanks by taking my PlayStation over to my new apartment.\n\nWell, maybe I love you. Hey, man. Hi. Hi. Hey, guys.\n\nNo. I don't wanna play video games. Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving? Yeah. Yeah.\n\nWhy? What's up? Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come. For real?\n\nNo. Then you should go to Chalmers because none of us knows how to cook. We'll probably just end up drinking all day. No. No.\n\nWe go to your lunch. Yeah. So we we we have to stop across the hall because it's my sister. But, you know, actually, growing up with a sister It was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah.\n\nYou you should tell your friends that. Okay. How you got 3 women to marry you, I'll never know. Hey, Mon. Look.\n\nI'm melting butter. That's great, Rach. And now I have the cooking skills of a hot day. Hey. Hey.\n\nHey. Hey. Cheek it out. Yeah. For my dessert, I have chosen to make a traditional English trifle.\n\nWow. That sounds great. And what are you making Monica, you know, in case Rachel's dessert is so good that I eat all of it. There's none left for anybody Hell, uh-huh. Nothing?\n\nNothing? No, sweetie. I trust you. So if I if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert? You're not gonna mess it out.\n\nWow. Monica, I love that. You really have faith in me. Thank Q. Technical question.\n\nHow do you know when, the butter is done? Well, it's done about 2 minutes before it looks like that. Hey. Hey. Oh, look.\n\nThe food smells great, man. Yeah. And the place looks so nice. And hey. Hey.\n\nHappy everybody. Thanksgiving. Well, this has been great. See you. Where are you going?\n\nOh, oh, we did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having. Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl? Some would say she's attractive. Yes. And who else is going to be there?\n\nThat is some of her friends. Yeah. Her dancer friends? Yes. Right?\n\nAll of our hot dancer friends are gonna be there, and we we we we we we we we Dude, we were good. You're not gonna go anywhere. You said you're gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here. Yeah. And and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgiving y.\n\nBut but it is. It's Just like the 1st Thanksgiving when the Indians and the pilgrims, sat down to dinner. Yeah. Yeah. And then the Indians taught the pilgrims what it meant to be hot In the new world.\n\nFellas, I really think you should stay here. You're just jealous because you can't go. That is so not true. Hello, everybody. Hi.\n\nHey. Mom. Hey. That's Look. Look who it is.\n\nIt's Chandler. Hi, yes. Of course. Hello, Jennifer. Mister and missus Geller, you look wonderful.\n\nIt is great to have you here. Let us take Top your coats. Woah. Is no one out there? No.\n\nMonica, all this food looks wonderful. You should think about doing this For a living. Okay. I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point.\n\nDan, Chandler was just laughing at your joke. My joke wasn't funny. Well, Chandler laughs at everything. That that's one of the great things about him. Well Great.\n\nGreat. I just remembered. I had a dream about mister Geller last night. Really? Yeah.\n\nI dreamt that he saved me from a burning building, and he was so brave and so strong. And it's making me look at him totally differently. You know? I mean, he used to be just, you know, Jack Eller, Monica and Ross's dad, and now he's He's Jack Geller, dream hug. I don't know.\n\nYou know, to me, he'll always be Jack Geller walks in while you're changing. You know, dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends. Yes. I know. Now Ross sure is a great guy.\n\nYou know, I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father. I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do? He's a headliner of a gay burlesque show. Rach, you're killing us here.\n\nWill you serve the dessert already? These drunken dancers are waiting. Look at it. Isn't it beautiful? Yeah.\n\nYeah. What is it? It's a trifle. It's got all of these layers. 1st, there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, Which I make from scratch.\n\nThen raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, and then a little bit more Custer and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top. What what was the one right before bananas? The beef? Yeah. That was weird to me too.\n\nBut then, you know, I I thought, well, there's minced meat pie. I mean, that's an English dessert. These people just Very strange things in their food. You know? Oh, by the way, can I borrow some rum from your place?\n\nYeah. Sure. Yeah. Okay. And while I'm gone, don't you boys sneak a taste.\n\nHey. Beef in a dessert that no. No. No. There is no way.\n\nI know. And only 1 layer of jam? What is up with that? Oh my god. The pages are stuck together.\n\nChandler. Oh my god. She she made half an English trifle and Half a shepherd's pie. Man, now she's gonna start all over. We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world.\n\nNo. No. We will. We'll we just won't tell her. She messed up.\n\nJust let her serve the beef custard thing? Yeah. It'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story. Vomiting stories are funny, I guess. Joey, god.\n\nYour apartment is like a 100 degrees. Did did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear? No. Still not hot enough. Rachel.\n\nYeah. Okay. Look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh, and I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.\n\nMom, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is. Oh, thank you, Chandler. I just bought it. Oh, yes. Well, it's very beautiful, and it's cream colored and tight and I don't mean tie.\n\nI mean, it's not too tight. Not that I was looking at What's the matter with him? I think he's stoned again. What? What?\n\nDude, I need to talk to you a sec. Okay. I think I might know why my parents don't like you. You do? Why?\n\nOkay. Remember, we were young. Hey.
