Yes. Okay. Well, that's good to know. The mister Hey, Monica. There's a customer who wants to compliment the chef. Shall I let him in? Sure. I love this part. Come on in. Hi. Richard. Actually, I'm not here to compliment the chef. Oh, well, that's okay. I hate when people come back to compliment the chef. Like, I have nothing better to do. So what's up? Well, it was great seeing you the other night. Oh, it's good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that? No. Came here to tell you something else. Came here to tell you I still love you. What, what did you what? I still love you, And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this. I mean, you're with Chandler, a guy I really like. And if you say he's straight, I'll believe you. After seeing you the other night, I knew if I didn't tell you, I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting it go was the stupidest thing I ever did. You know, you're really not supposed to be back here. Well, yeah, I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place, but I had to tell you. I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you. Oh my god. Why don't they put chairs back here? Look. I know this is crazy, but am I too late? Yes. You're too late. Where was all this 3 years ago? Yeah. I know. I was An idiot. And I tried to forget you. I I really did. You know? After we had lunch last year, I spent 6 months in Africa trying to get you out of my head. What were you doing in Africa? Working with blind kids. Oh, what are you doing to me? I'm like, I'm sorry, but, it's this is not gonna happen. Okay. It's fine. I'll walk away, and I'll never bother you again, but only If you tell me that Chandler's willing to give you everything I am. Well, he is. Yeah. I mean, marriage is all he talks a valid oh my goodness. In fact, I'm the one that's making him wait. You are? Yeah. Why? Why? Because of the government? Isn't it incredible? Yeah. Monica and Chandler are getting married. I know. They're gonna be so happy together. Oh. I mean, 2 best friends falling in love. How often that happen? Not that often. No. I'm so happy for them. Me too. So happy for them. I'm so happy and not at Jealous. Oh, no. Oh, god. Definitely not jealous. I mean, I'm probably 98% happy and maybe 2% jealous. And, I mean, what's 2% that's nothing? Totally. Like 90/10. Yeah. Me too. Hey. Have you guys seen Chandler? What? No. But, you know, who did stop in here looking for you? So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that, do you? Sure. I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean, look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Yeah. Pigs don't mate for life. I mean, a pig can have, like, a 100 sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig, not even a pig that's good at sports. Yeah. But that's pigs, not people. If marriage worked, I'd be all for it, but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%. Are you honestly telling me that that you may never wanna get married? Who's to say? You. You wanna say? Well, Well, never say never, but, you know, probably, yeah, never. Oh my god. Then then then what are we even doing? What is this? Woah. Woah. Woah. What is all this pressure? Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of the rules, It's man trap? You know what? I gotta go. It's okay. I got a plan. We're gonna find love. Definitely. Yeah. I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% for Monica and Chandler. It'd be nice to have a little guarantee, though. What do you mean? Well, you know, some people make deals with a friend. Like, if Neither of them are married. By the time they're 40, they marry each other. Mhmm. You mean a backup? Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I've got that. You do? Mhmm. Who? Joey. Joey? Yeah. Are you serious? Yeah. I locked him in years ago. Wait. So if neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey. Yeah. We shook on it. Yeah. But believe me, that is not how he wanted to seal the deal. Oh, Seriously? Ugh. Yeah. I think his exact words were Charming. The backup. Hey, Monica. Have you seen Rachel or Amir? Just for my boat, pretty cool. Yeah. It's great. Woah. Woah. What's the matter? Talk to the captain. I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead end relationship. Chandler giving you a hard time. It's not like I wanna get married tomorrow. It's just, I'd like to believe that I'm I'm in a relationship that's going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time. Oh, you know Chandler. No. I don't know Chandler. Not anymore. It's like it's like something's changed. Maybe you changed. I didn't change. Maybe that's the problem. What? Chandler is a complex fellow, Yes. 1 who was unlikely to take a one. Is that some kind of boat talk? I don't know. I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet. What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing? Monica, face it. Chandler is against marriage, and and always will be. Yeah. Well, there's some people who do wanna marry me. There are? Yeah. Richard. Richard said he wants to marry you, and and Chandler is telling you how much he hates marriage. That's right. Chandler loves marriage. You just told me that he hates marriage, that that he's a A complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife. That that he's against marriage and always will be. You got that from what I Yes. I said When the cretaceous period The period ended. The dinosaurs were gone. What happened to you guys? It's rage. Hey, you. Hey. Come on in. Oh, thank you. Hey. You know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth. Oh, thanks. Yeah. I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but, I guess it just wasn't meant to be. Yeah. Love, it's a tricky business, ain't it? I guess so. So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other. We like each other. We've already slept together, so, you know, there'll be no surprises there. You know what I mean? They'll, like, what that? Oh, you you want me to be your backup? Exactly. Oh, yeah. I already have one. What? Who? Phoebe. Phoebe? Wait a moment. But she but she just she said Joey is her backup. Oh, I don't think so. Yes. Ross, I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal. That's impossible. I mean, we have had a deal for years. We we we shook on it. Although, believe me, she wanted to do a lot more than that. Hey, Gunther. It's Joey. Is Chandler there? Alright. Listen. What kind of muffins do they serve at sea? Where the hell have you been? I was making a coconut phone with the professor. Richard told Monica he wants to marry her. What? Yeah. Yeah. I've been trying to find you to tell you stop messing with her. And maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off. Like oh my god. I know. They suck. He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him. I'm supposed to do that. I know. What what? You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there. I'm gonna kick his ass. Will you help me? Look, Chandler, I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. K? Just go and find Monica. You're right. Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna get the ring. I'm gonna get the ring. I'm gonna go find her, and I'm just I'm just gonna propose. Okay. Okay. Okay. Do do do let me know about that coconut phone. It might be good for the boat. Hi. Hi. I don't know why I'm here.

Yes. Okay. Well, that's good to know. The mister Hey, Monica.\n\nThere's a customer who wants to compliment the chef. Shall I let him in? Sure. I love this part. Come on in.\n\nHi. Richard. Actually, I'm not here to compliment the chef. Oh, well, that's okay. I hate when people come back to compliment the chef.\n\nLike, I have nothing better to do. So what's up? Well, it was great seeing you the other night. Oh, it's good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?\n\nNo. Came here to tell you something else. Came here to tell you I still love you. What, what did you what? I still love you, And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this.\n\nI mean, you're with Chandler, a guy I really like. And if you say he's straight, I'll believe you. After seeing you the other night, I knew if I didn't tell you, I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting it go was the stupidest thing I ever did. You know, you're really not supposed to be back here.\n\nWell, yeah, I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place, but I had to tell you. I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.\n\nOh my god. Why don't they put chairs back here? Look. I know this is crazy, but am I too late? Yes.\n\nYou're too late. Where was all this 3 years ago? Yeah. I know. I was An idiot.\n\nAnd I tried to forget you. I I really did. You know? After we had lunch last year, I spent 6 months in Africa trying to get you out of my head. What were you doing in Africa?\n\nWorking with blind kids. Oh, what are you doing to me? I'm like, I'm sorry, but, it's this is not gonna happen. Okay. It's fine.\n\nI'll walk away, and I'll never bother you again, but only If you tell me that Chandler's willing to give you everything I am. Well, he is. Yeah. I mean, marriage is all he talks a valid oh my goodness. In fact, I'm the one that's making him wait.\n\nYou are? Yeah. Why? Why? Because of the government?\n\nIsn't it incredible? Yeah. Monica and Chandler are getting married. I know. They're gonna be so happy together.\n\nOh. I mean, 2 best friends falling in love. How often that happen? Not that often. No.\n\nI'm so happy for them. Me too. So happy for them. I'm so happy and not at Jealous. Oh, no.\n\nOh, god. Definitely not jealous. I mean, I'm probably 98% happy and maybe 2% jealous. And, I mean, what's 2% that's nothing? Totally.\n\nLike 90/10. Yeah. Me too. Hey. Have you guys seen Chandler?\n\nWhat? No. But, you know, who did stop in here looking for you? So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that, do you? Sure.\n\nI do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean, look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Yeah.\n\nPigs don't mate for life. I mean, a pig can have, like, a 100 sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig, not even a pig that's good at sports. Yeah. But that's pigs, not people. If marriage worked, I'd be all for it, but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is?\n\n97%. Are you honestly telling me that that you may never wanna get married? Who's to say? You. You wanna say?\n\nWell, Well, never say never, but, you know, probably, yeah, never. Oh my god. Then then then what are we even doing? What is this? Woah.\n\nWoah. Woah. What is all this pressure? Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of the rules, It's man trap?\n\nYou know what? I gotta go. It's okay. I got a plan. We're gonna find love.\n\nDefinitely. Yeah. I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% for Monica and Chandler. It'd be nice to have a little guarantee, though.\n\nWhat do you mean? Well, you know, some people make deals with a friend. Like, if Neither of them are married. By the time they're 40, they marry each other. Mhmm.\n\nYou mean a backup? Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nI've got that. You do? Mhmm. Who? Joey.\n\nJoey? Yeah. Are you serious? Yeah. I locked him in years ago.\n\nWait. So if neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey. Yeah. We shook on it. Yeah.\n\nBut believe me, that is not how he wanted to seal the deal. Oh, Seriously? Ugh. Yeah. I think his exact words were Charming.\n\nThe backup. Hey, Monica. Have you seen Rachel or Amir? Just for my boat, pretty cool. Yeah.\n\nIt's great. Woah. Woah. What's the matter? Talk to the captain.\n\nI'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead end relationship. Chandler giving you a hard time. It's not like I wanna get married tomorrow. It's just, I'd like to believe that I'm I'm in a relationship that's going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time. Oh, you know Chandler.\n\nNo. I don't know Chandler. Not anymore. It's like it's like something's changed. Maybe you changed.\n\nI didn't change. Maybe that's the problem. What? Chandler is a complex fellow, Yes. 1 who was unlikely to take a one.\n\nIs that some kind of boat talk? I don't know. I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet. What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?\n\nMonica, face it. Chandler is against marriage, and and always will be. Yeah. Well, there's some people who do wanna marry me. There are?\n\nYeah. Richard. Richard said he wants to marry you, and and Chandler is telling you how much he hates marriage. That's right. Chandler loves marriage.\n\nYou just told me that he hates marriage, that that he's a A complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife. That that he's against marriage and always will be. You got that from what I Yes. I said When the cretaceous period The period ended. The dinosaurs were gone.\n\nWhat happened to you guys? It's rage. Hey, you. Hey. Come on in.\n\nOh, thank you. Hey. You know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth. Oh, thanks. Yeah.\n\nI really thought we'd be able to make it work, but, I guess it just wasn't meant to be. Yeah. Love, it's a tricky business, ain't it? I guess so. So what do you say we make a pact?\n\nIf you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other. We like each other. We've already slept together, so, you know, there'll be no surprises there. You know what I mean?\n\nThey'll, like, what that? Oh, you you want me to be your backup? Exactly. Oh, yeah. I already have one.\n\nWhat? Who? Phoebe. Phoebe? Wait a moment.\n\nBut she but she just she said Joey is her backup. Oh, I don't think so. Yes. Ross, I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal. That's impossible.\n\nI mean, we have had a deal for years. We we we shook on it. Although, believe me, she wanted to do a lot more than that. Hey, Gunther. It's Joey.\n\nIs Chandler there? Alright. Listen. What kind of muffins do they serve at sea? Where the hell have you been?\n\nI was making a coconut phone with the professor. Richard told Monica he wants to marry her. What? Yeah. Yeah.\n\nI've been trying to find you to tell you stop messing with her. And maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off. Like oh my god. I know. They suck.\n\nHe's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him. I'm supposed to do that. I know. What what? You know what I'm gonna do?\n\nI'm gonna go over there. I'm gonna kick his ass. Will you help me? Look, Chandler, I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. K?\n\nJust go and find Monica. You're right. Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna get the ring.\n\nI'm gonna get the ring. I'm gonna go find her, and I'm just I'm just gonna propose. Okay. Okay. Okay.\n\nDo do do let me know about that coconut phone. It might be good for the boat. Hi. Hi. I don't know why I'm here.\n\nI didn't ask.", "paragraphs": [{"sentences": [{"text": "To solidify your commitment, to declare your love for one another to the world?", "start": 0.39999998, "end":
