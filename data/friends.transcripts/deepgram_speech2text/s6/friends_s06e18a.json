Mind blowing lectures.\n\nDoctor Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department. Hotties of the paleontology department. There's a big selling calendar. Who wrote it? Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.\n\nHey. Do you still have the final exams? Yeah. Oh, because you could just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer. A hot girl's at stake, and all of a sudden, he's Rain Man.\n\nWait a minute. Wait a minute. Why are we so sure that this is a girl? It's a girl. Anyway, it wouldn't matter.\n\nOkay? Because I'm I'm a teacher. She's a student. Oh, is that against the rules? No.\n\nBut it is frowned upon. I see. Besides, there's a big age difference. Well, think of it like this. When you're 90 I know.\n\nWhen I'm 90, she'll be, like, 80, and it won't seem like such a big difference. No. That's not what I was gonna say at all. No. What I was gonna say is when you're 90, You still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20 year old.\n\nMonica? I don't know. Okay. Hey, Chandler. You know that girl you went to college with who who became a movie director?\n\nOh, yeah. Dana Keystone. She was in my movement class. What's a movement class?

Coming through. Oh, okay.\n\nWell, it's not so bad. Yeah. Most of the damage is pretty much contained to the bedrooms. Oh my god. Hey, buddy.\n\nDo you think I could borrow your uniform this Thursday? Excuse me. Joey, he's working. You would look good in that. Oh, how bad is it?\n\nOh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing there that isn't burned is an ax, Which I do not remember buying. How's your room, Rach? Everything's ruined.\n\nMy bed, my clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater. Isn't that mine? Fine. I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nSo, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while. You I I am not in the mood to be hit on right now. But if you give me your number, I will call you some other time. Yes. They can stay with us.\n\nHave you figured out what started the fire, mister fireman? Well, do either of you smoke? Oh, not usually, but, yeah, I could use 1 right now. Thank you. Do you like candles, burn incense?\n\nYes. I do all the time. I love them. Oh my god. I did it.\n\nIt's me. It's me.

God, it's great to catch Chop, I can't believe how long it's been.\n\nHey, Chandler. Is that Oh, that's great. Good for you. Okay. So, yeah, maybe we can get together.\n\nCan you hold on for one second, please? What? When you're off the phone, you wanna get a pizza? Hi. I'm back.\n\nYeah. That sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay.\n\nBye. Hey. Listen. So when when's my audition? I mean, I know it's Thursday, but what time?\n\nHi. Hey. We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee, and then we'll do it then. Uh-huh.\n\nWow. So now you're going on a date with this girl? Honey, it is not a date. I haven't talked to her in 10 years. You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in 10 years and ask them for a favor.\n\nThere are rules. You know? You gotta you gotta put in some time. Right. I'm sorry.\n\nIt's not like you're, you know, going out with an ex girlfriend. No. We only went out once. You dated her? Not once.\n\nGreat. Well, why don't I just go out with an ex boyfriend, you know, and, you know, do Joey a favor. Hey. Wanna do Joey a favor? Maybe you go out with Joey.\n\nThat's great. My friend Joey's in the movie business. Oh. You know who I ran into from school? Howie.\n\nMy friend's name is Joey. Apparently, Howie's editing now. Yeah.

Oh my god. Yeah.\n\nShouldn't it look this way when I lived here? I know. Now look. There's only 1 problem, though. There's only room for 1, so I guess 1 of you will have to stay at Joey's.\n\nWell, since the fire was kind of my fault, I guess you should get to stay here. Hey. Hey. Hey. No.\n\nThis was no one's fault, Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident. Well, no. It was my fault, so you should get the nice room.\n\nOkay. So, Rach, You're the 1st guest at Hotel Monica. Come on. Yeah.
