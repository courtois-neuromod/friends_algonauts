Take your time. Off. You know, just so you know, I was a freshman and she was a senior, so it wasn't as bad as as Look. I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs, and off.

I'm sorry you're talking about Emily. Off. Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffee house at 6. We said 7. We said 6. Off. The only way that I said 6 would be if I said the sentence, let's meet at 7, not at 6. Yeah. And if I had said 7, maybe I would have said something like this. Wow. My boyfriend is such a wise ass. 7. Hi. Off of. My good boy. I know what time you said. What? Well, actually, I know what time Chester and Marsha said. Off What time? Quite an interesting turn of events. Suddenly, it's my book to the rescue. Off. Oh, very interesting. Yeah. Well, this certainly clears things up. What does it say? Off. I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book. Thank you for writing your book. It's it's a great book, off. And you are the queen of everything. Thanks. So are you. Off Told you I should not wear this color. Off Monica Marsha and Chester are planning on seeing a movie Sunday night. Marsha thinks they're supposed to meet at 6. Off. Chester thinks it's at 7. So you knew we were gonna miss the movie?

I have to admit that after all the wonderful things Lizzie has told me and the many, many, off. Many stories that Rachel has told me that well, you're not off. All bad? Not all bad.\n\nAnd and, you know, I'm I'm sorry I was so harsh off. Before, but you have to understand, I still look at Lizzie like she's a 12 year old girl. Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean.\n\nI do that too. Off. I beg your pardon? No. No.\n\nI'm not. I don't mean I I see her as a 12 year old girl. I mean, I I have a son off.

I'm sorry you're talking about Emily.\n\nOff. Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffee house at 6. We said 7. We said 6. Off.\n\nThe only way that I said 6 would be if I said the sentence, let's meet at 7, not at 6. Yeah. And if I had said 7, maybe I would have said something like this. Wow. My boyfriend is such a wise ass.\n\n7. Hi. Off of. My good boy. I know what time you said.\n\nWhat? Well, actually, I know what time Chester and Marsha said. Off What time? Quite an interesting turn of events. Suddenly, it's my book to the rescue.\n\nOff. Oh, very interesting. Yeah. Well, this certainly clears things up. What does it say?\n\nOff. I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book. Thank you for writing your book. It's it's a great book, off. And you are the queen of everything.\n\nThanks. So are you.

So, Ross, did Did you kill any of these wives?\n\nI I have had enough of this. You know? I I I care a great deal about your daughter, and I have treated her with nothing off thing, but respect.
