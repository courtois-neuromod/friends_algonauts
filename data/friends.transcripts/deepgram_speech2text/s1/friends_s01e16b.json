See, after I let her go, I got a call from her psychiatrist, doctor Flane, and and doctor Flane and doctor Flane.\n\nAnd, He informed me that, she took the news rather badly. In fact, he, he mentioned the word frenzy. Yeah. You're kidding. She seems so Oh, no.\n\nNo. Nina? She is woo woo woo woo woo woo. In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection They're being fired at all. Not at all.\n\nThat's unbelievable. And yet believable. So I've decided not To fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself or others. I see. I guess you never really know what's going on inside a person's head.\n\nWell, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir. The sound mom and dad will never forget. For this, after all, is the miracle of birth. Lights, please. Annette's having a baby.\n\nNext week is her final clash. Susan, go deep. It's impossible. It's just just impossible. What is, honey?\n\nWhat that woman Dude, I am not doing that. It's just gonna have to stay in. That's all. Everything will be the same. It'll just stay in.\n\nVery funny. Shh. Everything's gonna be alright. What do you know? No one's going up to you and saying, hi.\n\nIs that your nostril mind if we push this pot roast through it? Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath. I know it's frightening, but big picture, the birth part is just one day. And when it's over, We're all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.\n\nI mean, that's what this is all about. Right, Ross? Ross. I'm gonna be a father. Is it just occurring to you?\n\nI always knew I was having a baby. I just never realized the baby was having me. Oh, you're gonna be great. Oh, How could you say that? I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat.\n\nHow am I gonna raise a kid? You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that that monkeys and babies are actually different. You might wanna look into it. Where are you going? To With?\n\nYes. Alright. Can I just ask you 1 question? Have you 2, you know, like, you know you know Yet. Well, not that it's any of your business, but, no, we haven't.\n\nK? You meant sex. Right? Do you have a sec? Sure, Nina.\n\nWhat's up? I don't know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks. Oh, well, maybe that's because they're, jealous of us. Maybe.\n\nThat doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors. Well, Maybe that's, because you're getting a big raise. I am? Sure. Why not?\n\nOh my god. You're amazing. Oh, You don't know. Hell, can we make sure we put through the paperwork on miss Bookbinder's raise? So you still want me to send her Ecological profile to personnel?\n\nWhat? Helen Drinks. Will you marry me? So after the proposal, I kind of unraveled. Right.\n\nBecause you were really in control up until then. Yeah. Well, I ended up telling her everything. Oh, how'd she take it? Pretty well, except for the stapler thing.\n\nLittle tip. If you're ever in a similar situation, never ever Leave your hand on the desk. Okay. I think I get how to do this. Alright.\n\nSo can we turn this off? Can we just make it make them go away? Because I can't I can't. Okay, Phoebe. They're gone.\n\nOkay. Are you alright? Yeah. It's just you know, it's this whole stupid Ursula thing. It's okay, Phoebe.\n\nCan I ask? So he's going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible? Yeah. Look, I mean, I'm not saying she's, like, evil or anything.\n\nShe just you know, she's always breaking my stuff. When I was 8, and I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson Thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then when I was 12 and she broke my collarbone. Alright. I mean, shouldn't mean to do it, but I think it still counts.\n\nAnd then oh, and then there's Randy Brown who's like have you ever had a friend who was like your best friend? No. No. Well but that's what it was for me. And she, you know, kinda stole him away and then broke his heart.\n\nAnd then he wouldn't even Talk to me anymore because he said he didn't wanna be around anything that looked like either one of us. Pheebs. I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend or my thermos. No. Or anything.\n\nBut You're not gonna lose him. You gotta talk to Joey. Yeah. No. Come on.\n\nHe doesn't know this stuff. He knew how you felt. Yeah. But he's falling in love her. Oh, please.\n\nThey've been going out a week. They haven't even slept together yet. I mean, that's not serious. Okay. Okay.\n\nOh, okay. Oh. Yeah. May we help you? Rachel, what are you doing?\n\nIt's freezing out here. Would you come back inside? No. No. No.\n\nNo. No. You wanted me to take him down, So I'm taking him down. Okay?
