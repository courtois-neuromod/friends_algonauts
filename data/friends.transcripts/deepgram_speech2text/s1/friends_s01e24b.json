You know how you always think you're great in bed? The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.\n\nWell, it's like, last night, a I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great, so I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got, man, oh, man, Was like a tick a tape parade. Yes. I know. As it happens, my room is very, very close to the parade route.\n\nThat. It was amazing, and not just for her. For me too. That It's like all of a sudden, I'm blind, but all my other senses are heightened. You know?\n\nIt's like that I was able to appreciate it on another level. That. I didn't know you had another level. I know. Neither did I.\n\nHey. Was something going on with Poche? That. Allowed. Hey.\n\nGreat skirt. Birthday present? Yeah. From who?

Man, hell of a 2 weeks. You know what, though?\n\nI really feel like I learned something. That. Really? So you're gonna stick with this it's all for her thing? What are you?\n\nCrazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? I'm just saying. A If I see one more picture of Ed Begley junior in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself. I mean, don't get me wrong.\n\nThat. I'm not against environmental issues per se. It's just that guy. I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me. Would you excuse me, please?\n\nI'm trying to have a date here. Fine. Just stop thinking about me. Can't do it, can you? So I'm thinking about you.\n\nSo what? That. I don't get it.
