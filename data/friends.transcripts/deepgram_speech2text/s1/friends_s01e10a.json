That would be Marcel. You wanna say hi? No. No. I don't. Oh, he is Precious, where did you get him? My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab. That is so cruel. Why? Why would a parent name Their child Bethel. Hey. That monkey's got a Ross on his ass. Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment? Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left. So Why don't you just get a roommate? I don't know. I think you reach a certain age. Having a roommate is just Kind of pathetic. Sorry. That's that's pathet, which is Sanskrit for really cool way to live. Tonight. I have 12 new songs about my mother's suicide and one about a snowman. Might wanna open with a snowman. Hi, Joey. Hey, Joey. How are you? Hey, Joe. So how'd it go? I didn't get the job. Oh. How can you not get it? You were Santa last year. I don't know. Some fat guy sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly. It's all political. So what are you gonna be? I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face. You know? Hey. Do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Oh, no. We have a Shay, what what is wrong with New Giers. Well, nothing for you. You have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday. Desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have somebody to kiss when the ball Drops. Man, I'm talking loud. Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. If you wish. I've got an idea. Dinner. It's perfect. We'll put it between lunch and breakfast. Just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates. We make a pact. Just The 6 of us, dinner. Oh, sure. Hope you have a wine. You know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. Phoebe, you're on. Oh oh, good. Oh. Okay. Hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, miss Phoebe Buffet. Hi. Thanks. Hi. The song that means a lot to me this time of year. Snow. How was I supposed to know that my mom was dead in the kitchen? My mother's ashes, even her Her eyelashes are resting in a little yellow jar. And sometimes when it's breezy Yeah. I feel a little sneezy. And now excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Yeah. Noisy boys. Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group? No. No. That's that's okay. Well, come on. If it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, Then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear. That guy's going home with a note. Enough. I was I was just saying like Could you speak, please? Sorry. I I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in in my life. And then he said that you you said you thought Darryl Anne Hannah. Was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life. And I said, yeah. I liked her in splash a lot, but not so much in in Wall Street. I thought you had a hard bar quality. Quality in that. And, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are, luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, that that that's when you started yelling. Okay. We're gonna take a short break. I think that guy's going home with more than a note. Come here, Marcel. Sit here. Babes, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean, god, by my 6th date with Paolo, I mean, he had already named both my breasts. Oh, did did I just share too much? Just a smidge. David's like, you know, a scientist guy. He's very methodical. I think it's romantic. Me 2. Did you ever see an officer and a gentleman? Yeah. Yes. Well, he's kind of like the guy I went to see that with. Except except he's smarter and gentler and sweeter. I just I just wanna be with him all the time, you know, day and night and night and day And special occasions. Wait a minute. Wait. I see where this is going. You're gonna coming to New Year's, aren't you? You're gonna break the pack. She's gonna break the pack. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Yeah. Could I just Yeah. Because I already asked Janice. Oh, come on. This was a pact. This was your pact. I snapped. Okay? I couldn't handle the pressure, and I snapped. Yep. But, Janice, that that was, like, the worst breakup in history. I'm not saying it was a good idea. I'm saying I snapped. Hi. Hey. Hi, Sam Lee. Too many jokes. Mush mock Joey. Nice shoes. God, you're killing me. Oh, Ross. What? Not he's playing with my spatulas again. Well, Keith, it's not gonna hurt them. Right? Do you always have to bring him here? Look. I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We we had our 1st fight this morning. I think it Has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he threw some feces. You know, if you're gonna work late, I can look in on him for you. Oh, that'd be great. Okay. But if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him. Okay? And you're not, like, doing it as a favor to me. Okay. But if he asks, because I'm not going to lie. But you can't actually test this theory because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions. Okay. Alright. I have a question then. Yeah. Were you planning on kissing me ever? That's definitely a valid question, and, the answer would Yes. Yes. I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment because, well, because it's it's you. Sure. Yeah. Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be. And now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one things where I just, like, sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it, and, I'm not really a, sweeping Sorta fella. Oh, okay. I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper trapped inside a Physicist's body. Really? Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it. Just sweep and throw me. Now? Now?

You guys, it's starting to snow. Oh. Oh, and look. Ugly naked guys hanging candy canes.\n\nMhmm. Where? Oh, Well, that's festive. Guys, there's, somebody I'd like you to meet. Wait.\n\nWait. What is that? That would be Marcel. You wanna say hi? No.\n\nNo. I don't. Oh, he is Precious, where did you get him? My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab. That is so cruel.\n\nWhy? Why would a parent name Their child Bethel. Hey. That monkey's got a Ross on his ass. Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?\n\nYeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left. So Why don't you just get a roommate? I don't know. I think you reach a certain age.\n\nHaving a roommate is just Kind of pathetic. Sorry. That's that's pathet, which is Sanskrit for really cool way to live. Tonight. I have 12 new songs about my mother's suicide and one about a snowman.\n\nMight wanna open with a snowman. Hi, Joey. Hey, Joey. How are you? Hey, Joe.\n\nSo how'd it go? I didn't get the job. Oh. How can you not get it? You were Santa last year.\n\nI don't know. Some fat guy sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly. It's all political. So what are you gonna be?\n\nI'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face. You know? Hey. Do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's?\n\nOh, no. We have a Shay, what what is wrong with New Giers. Well, nothing for you. You have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday.\n\nDesperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have somebody to kiss when the ball Drops. Man, I'm talking loud. Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. If you wish. I've got an idea.\n\nDinner. It's perfect. We'll put it between lunch and breakfast. Just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates.\n\nWe make a pact. Just The 6 of us, dinner. Oh, sure. Hope you have a wine. You know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.\n\nPhoebe, you're on. Oh oh, good. Oh. Okay. Hi.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, miss Phoebe Buffet. Hi. Thanks. Hi. The song that means a lot to me this time of year.\n\nSnow. How was I supposed to know that my mom was dead in the kitchen? My mother's ashes, even her Her eyelashes are resting in a little yellow jar. And sometimes when it's breezy Yeah. I feel a little sneezy.\n\nAnd now excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Yeah. Noisy boys.\n\nIs it something that you would like to share with the entire group? No. No. That's that's okay. Well, come on.\n\nIf it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, Then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear. That guy's going home with a note. Enough. I was I was just saying like Could you speak, please? Sorry.\n\nI I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in in my life. And then he said that you you said you thought Darryl Anne Hannah. Was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life. And I said, yeah. I liked her in splash a lot, but not so much in in Wall Street.\n\nI thought you had a hard bar quality. Quality in that. And, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are, luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, that that that's when you started yelling. Okay.\n\nWe're gonna take a short break. I think that guy's going home with more than a note. Come here, Marcel. Sit here. Babes, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet.\n\nI mean, god, by my 6th date with Paolo, I mean, he had already named both my breasts. Oh, did did I just share too much? Just a smidge. David's like, you know, a scientist guy. He's very methodical.\n\nI think it's romantic. Me 2. Did you ever see an officer and a gentleman? Yeah. Yes.\n\nWell, he's kind of like the guy I went to see that with. Except except he's smarter and gentler and sweeter. I just I just wanna be with him all the time, you know, day and night and night and day And special occasions. Wait a minute. Wait.\n\nI see where this is going. You're gonna coming to New Year's, aren't you? You're gonna break the pack. She's gonna break the pack. No.\n\nNo. No. No. No. No.\n\nNo. Yeah. Could I just Yeah. Because I already asked Janice. Oh, come on.\n\nThis was a pact. This was your pact. I snapped. Okay? I couldn't handle the pressure, and I snapped.\n\nYep. But, Janice, that that was, like, the worst breakup in history. I'm not saying it was a good idea. I'm saying I snapped. Hi.\n\nHey. Hi, Sam Lee. Too many jokes. Mush mock Joey. Nice shoes.\n\nGod, you're killing me. Oh, Ross. What? Not he's playing with my spatulas again. Well, Keith, it's not gonna hurt them.\n\nRight? Do you always have to bring him here? Look. I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright?\n\nWe we had our 1st fight this morning. I think it Has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he threw some feces. You know, if you're gonna work late, I can look in on him for you. Oh, that'd be great.\n\nOkay. But if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him. Okay? And you're not, like, doing it as a favor to me. Okay.\n\nBut if he asks, because I'm not going to lie. But you can't actually test this theory because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions. Okay. Alright. I have a question then.\n\nYeah. Were you planning on kissing me ever? That's definitely a valid question, and, the answer would Yes. Yes. I was.\n\nBut, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment because, well, because it's it's you. Sure. Yeah. Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.\n\nAnd now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one things where I just, like, sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it, and, I'm not really a, sweeping Sorta fella. Oh, okay. I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper trapped inside a Physicist's body. Really?\n\nOh, yeah. Oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it. Just sweep and throw me. Now?\n\nNow? Oh, yeah. Right now. Just Okay. Okay.\n\nOkay. You know what? This is just really expensive. Okay. And I'll take it.\n\nThis was a gift. So now you're just kinda tidy. Okay. Okay. What what now?\n\nYou want me to actually throw you? You want you wanna just hop? I can hop. Tell me something. What does the phrase no date Pat, mean to you.\n\nLook. I'm sorry. Okay? It's just that Chandler has somebody and Phoebe has somebody. I thought I'd ask fun Bobby.\n\nFun Bobby? Your ex boyfriend Fun Bobby? Yeah. You know more than 1 Fun Bobby? I happen to know a Fun Okay.\n\nHere we go. Oh, oh, oh, there's no room for milk. There. Yeah. There it is.\n\nOkay. So on our no date Evening. 3 of you now are gonna have dates. 4. 4.\n\n5. 5. Sorry. I thought the cow was Catch you in earlier flight. Yeah.\n\nAnd I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do? Okay. So I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops? Oh, come on.\n\nWe'll have we'll have a big party, and then no one will know who's with who. Yeah. We'll all know. Hey. No.\n\nThis is so not what I needed right now. What's the matter? Oh, it's it's Marcel. He's angry with me again. I have no idea why.\n\nIt just keeps shutting me out. You know? He's walking around all the Time dragging his hands. That's so weird. I had such a blast with him the other night.\n\nReally? Yeah. We played. We watched TV, that juggling thing is amazing. What, what juggling thing?\n\nWith the Balled up socks? I figured you taught him that. No. You know, it wasn't that big a deal. I mean, just balled up socks And a melon.\n\nPhoebe. Hi. Hi, Vance.
