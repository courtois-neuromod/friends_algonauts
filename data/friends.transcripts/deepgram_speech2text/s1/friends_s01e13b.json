Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way. You're not see, that's why you're So great. Actually, it's it's quite, you know, typical behavior when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. You know, this Kind of codependent, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big Cups, which I'm sorry. Might as well have nipples on them. And you're all like, oh, define me. Define Find me. Love me. I need love. So you talked to your dad. Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted. My ma's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina see your husband anymore because he got a restraining order, which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today. Things sure have changed here on Walton's Mountain. Sir Joe, are you okay? Yeah. I guess. It's just, You know, they're parents. After a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you gotta let them make their own mistakes. And just think, in a couple of years, we get to turn into them. Oh, Jesus. If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blonde chasing a 20 year old boy's or I'll end up like my mom. Hey. Hey, Dave. Hey, Dave. How's it going? Okay. Except I broke up with Roger. Oh. Yeah. Right. Then go right away. What happened? I don't know. I mean, He's a good person, and he can be really sweet. And in some ways, I think he is so right for me. It's just I hate that guy.

You You know what I mean about how I'm always going out with all these women. Because I always figured when the right one comes along, I'll be able to be a stand up guy and go the distance. You know? I'm looking at my dad thinking, hey.\n\nYou're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe fitting business, did you cave?

I came to give you this and this. Big ring.\n\nWhy did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were Fine. The way they were. There's chicken in there. Put it away.\n\nFor god's sake, Joey. For real. Hold on. You you knew? Of course, I knew.\n\nWhat do you think? Your father is no James Bond. You shoulda heard some of his cover stories. I'm sleeping over at my accountants. I mean, what is that?\n\nPlease.

And what about you?\n\nMe? I'm fine. Look, honey. In an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else.\n\nEver since that poodle stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself he's been more attentive. He's been more loving. It's like every day is our anniversary. I'm happy for you. Well, don't be.\n\nI mean, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was. I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want. I know you did, Cookie.\n\nOh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her? Yeah. You're 10 times prettier than she is.\n\nThat's sweet. Can I take her?

What's what's wrong, sweetie? Nothing. Thanks.\n\nNothing. Oh, yeah. No. No. What's wrong?\n\nCome Okay. It's I mean, it's nothing. I'm fine. It's just, it's my friends. They they have a liking problem with you in that, they don't.\n\nOh, they don't? But, you know, They don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. You know? They don't see all the all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just you know, they think you're a little, What?\n\nIntense and creepy. Oh. But I don't. Me, Phoebe. Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.\n\nYou're not see, that's why you're So great. Actually, it's it's quite, you know, typical behavior when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. You know, this Kind of codependent, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big Cups, which I'm sorry. Might as well have nipples on them. And you're all like, oh, define me.\n\nDefine Find me. Love me. I need love. So you talked to your dad. Yeah.\n\nHe's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted. My ma's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina see your husband anymore because he got a restraining order, which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today. Things sure have changed here on Walton's Mountain. Sir Joe, are you okay? Yeah.\n\nI guess. It's just, You know, they're parents. After a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you gotta let them make their own mistakes. And just think, in a couple of years, we get to turn into them.\n\nOh, Jesus. If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blonde chasing a 20 year old boy's or I'll end up like my mom. Hey. Hey, Dave. Hey, Dave.\n\nHow's it going? Okay. Except I broke up with Roger. Oh. Yeah.\n\nRight. Then go right away. What happened? I don't know. I mean, He's a good person, and he can be really sweet.\n\nAnd in some ways, I think he is so right for me. It's just I hate that guy. Hey, Joey. What's going on? Clear the tracks for the Booby Payback Press.\n\nNext stop, Rachel Green. Hey there. Joey, what the hell were you doing? Sorry.
