I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. Oh, by the way, tomorrow, we're auditioning for a Broadway show. Excuse me? There's an open call for cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing memories and make complete fools of ourselves. What do you say? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Remember who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I I can't even stand in front of a tap class. Well, that's just probably because of your Amish background. What? Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch. Right? Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was Junt. I I used to be just like you. And then one day, I saw a movie that changed my life. Do you ever see dead poet society? Uh-huh. I thought that movie was so incredibly boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that? It's like, kid, wait a year. Leave home. Do some community theater. I walked out of there, and I thought, now that's 2 hours of my life that I'm never getting back, and that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do. Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend missus Doubtfire. Oh, god. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take, like, dogs and cows. See, I don't know who this is harder on, me or him. Let's say that Tara's taking the brunt of it. Marcel? Marcel? Marcel? No. Good boy. Say, how can nobody want him? Well, somebody will.

You know, you'd think I would've Hey. How about Joey Heatherton? Come on. Seriously. I told you. I don't wanna go back to Joey. Phoebe, what do you think a good stage name for me would be? Flame boy. Where exactly is your zoo? Well, it's, technically not a zoo per se. It's a more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you, some questions about is it, Marcel? Yes. Yes. Does he, fight with other animals? No. No. He's he's very docile. Even if he were Conrad? Why? I don't know. Why? How is he handling small objects? He can hold a banana, if that's what you mean. What about a hammer or a small blade? Why why why why would he need a blade? If he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you got to give the little guy something. Otherwise, it's just cruel. He got he got out of San Diego. What? Yeah. We'll we'll come back from our walk in, and the phone was was ringing. He's in. He's in. Did you hear that, Marcel? Oh, San Diego. San Diego. Yeah. You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all very well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start them off against a blind rabbit and give you 20% of the gates. Where the hell have you been? Monica and I just crash an embassy party? I think I'd kiss an archbishop. But, of course, it could have been a chef. Are you drunk? No. Why? I am so I dropped Oh, right, Monica. You know what? You could've called. I've been up here. I've been worrying Monica. What are the rules? Yes. Yes. It does. Okay. Look. The restaurant called again today.

Hold on a second, please. Monana. It's for you. The credit card people. Hello? Yes? Oh my god. Thanks. What? They've arrested Monica. Hi. Hey. How are you? Not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my color. How did you know I was here? Because I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using. That I was not expecting. I want you to know it wasn't me who turned you in. Oh, thanks. No. Thank you that you have given me so much. I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the Stage at the Winter Garden theater. Well, actually, you only got to sing Memoir. I just can't believe you're in here. And what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus? Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of 25 other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the big apple circus? Well, not worried. You know? Just wondering. There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were because that's who you are. Not necessarily. Yes, necessarily. I mean, I don't know what it is. Maybe it's the Amish thing. I'm not actually Amish. Really? Then why do you like that? You by the door. In or out. In. You in the back. You're getting it all wrong.

I don't know what to say, Ross. It's a monkey. Just just say what you feel, shall we? Marcel, I'm hungry. That was good. Marcel, this is for you. It's, just, you know, something to, do on the plane. If you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment. Just me and him. Oh, sure. Go ahead. Absolutely. Marcel, come here. Come here. Come here. Well, buddy, This is it. There's just a couple of things I wanted to say. I'm really gonna miss you. I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me. You've been it's more like a dickens game. Marcel, would you Marcel, would you would you leave my leg alone? Would you just stop pumping me for 2 Seconds? Marsa, would okay. Would you just take him away. Just take him.

I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. Oh, by the way, tomorrow, we're auditioning for a Broadway show. Excuse me?\n\nThere's an open call for cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing memories and make complete fools of ourselves. What do you say? No. No.\n\nNo. No. No. No. No.\n\nRemember who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I I can't even stand in front of a tap class. Well, that's just probably because of your Amish background. What?\n\nWell, you're Pennsylvania Dutch. Right? Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was Junt. I I used to be just like you.\n\nAnd then one day, I saw a movie that changed my life. Do you ever see dead poet society? Uh-huh. I thought that movie was so incredibly boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play?\n\nWhat was that? It's like, kid, wait a year. Leave home. Do some community theater. I walked out of there, and I thought, now that's 2 hours of my life that I'm never getting back, and that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.\n\nWow. Then I would definitely not recommend missus Doubtfire. Oh, god. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo.\n\nThey take, like, dogs and cows. See, I don't know who this is harder on, me or him. Let's say that Tara's taking the brunt of it. Marcel? Marcel?\n\nMarcel? No. Good boy. Say, how can nobody want him? Well, somebody will.\n\nYou know, there already is a Joseph Stalin. You're kidding. Apparently, he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've on that. You know, you'd think I would've Hey.\n\nHow about Joey Heatherton? Come on. Seriously. I told you. I don't wanna go back to Joey.\n\nPhoebe, what do you think a good stage name for me would be? Flame boy. Where exactly is your zoo? Well, it's, technically not a zoo per se. It's a more of an interactive wildlife experience.\n\nLet me ask you, some questions about is it, Marcel? Yes. Yes. Does he, fight with other animals? No.\n\nNo. He's he's very docile. Even if he were Conrad? Why? I don't know.\n\nWhy? How is he handling small objects? He can hold a banana, if that's what you mean. What about a hammer or a small blade? Why why why why would he need a blade?\n\nIf he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you got to give the little guy something. Otherwise, it's just cruel. He got he got out of San Diego. What? Yeah.\n\nWe'll we'll come back from our walk in, and the phone was was ringing. He's in. He's in. Did you hear that, Marcel? Oh, San Diego.\n\nSan Diego. Yeah. You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all very well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start them off against a blind rabbit and give you 20% of the gates. Where the hell have you been?\n\nMonica and I just crash an embassy party? I think I'd kiss an archbishop. But, of course, it could have been a chef. Are you drunk? No.\n\nWhy? I am so I dropped Oh, right, Monica. You know what? You could've called. I've been up here.\n\nI've been worrying Monica. What are the rules? Yes. Yes. It does.\n\nOkay. Look. The restaurant called again today. They wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work. Nope.\n\nCalled a big apple circus today. Okay. Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job. This is not you.\n\nNo. It is me. You know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in. Yeah. Well, I'm with her.\n\nI am so much more than that. I'm a nana. Hello. Yes. She is.\n\nHold on a second, please. Monana. It's for you. The credit card people. Hello?\n\nYes? Oh my god. Thanks. What? They've arrested Monica.\n\nHi. Hey. How are you? Not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my color.\n\nHow did you know I was here? Because I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using. That I was not expecting. I want you to know it wasn't me who turned you in.\n\nOh, thanks. No. Thank you that you have given me so much. I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the Stage at the Winter Garden theater. Well, actually, you only got to sing Memoir.\n\nI just can't believe you're in here. And what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus? Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of 25 other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the big apple circus?\n\nWell, not worried. You know? Just wondering. There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were because that's who you are.\n\nNot necessarily. Yes, necessarily. I mean, I don't know what it is. Maybe it's the Amish thing. I'm not actually Amish.\n\nReally? Then why do you like that? You by the door. In or out. In.\n\nYou in the back. You're getting it all wrong. At least I'm doing it. This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at eight 42 a. Okay.\n\nGoodbye, little monkey guy. I I wrote you this poem. Oh. Okay. But don't eat it till you get on the plane.\n\nThank you, miss Phoebe. Aw. Okay. Bye, champ. Now I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.\n\nI don't know what to say, Ross. It's a monkey. Just just say what you feel, shall we? Marcel, I'm hungry. That was good.\n\nMarcel, this is for you. It's, just, you know, something to, do on the plane. If you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment. Just me and him. Oh, sure.\n\nGo ahead. Absolutely. Marcel, come here. Come here. Come here.\n\nWell, buddy, This is it. There's just a couple of things I wanted to say. I'm really gonna miss you. I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me.\n\nYou've been it's more like a dickens game. Marcel, would you Marcel, would you would you leave my leg alone? Would you just stop pumping me for 2 Seconds? Marsa, would okay. Would you just take him away.\n\nJust take him. Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand that I might Touch thy cheek. That's fine.
