Yeah. Right. Serious? Oh, yeah. Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. Absolutely. Yeah. I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act. You know? I mean, it's like the stand up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes Yeah. And and it's not that we don't like the comedian. It's just that that's That's not why we bought the ticket. You see, the problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, You girls are always looking for the comedian again. You know? And they weren't in the car. We're fighting traffic. Basically, just trying to stay awake. Yeah. Well, word of advice. Bring back the comedian. Otherwise, next time, you're gonna find yourself sitting at home listening to that album alone. Are we still talking about sex? No. It's good. It it is good. It's just that, mhmm, doesn't she seem a little angry? Well, she has issues. Does she? It's easy trying to live with mister Hey. I'm evolving. She's out and banging other women over the head with a club while she sits at home trying to get the Mastodon smell out of the carpet. Marsha, see, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like, Gee, that glacier is getting kinda close. See? Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex wife? My no. No? Yes. It is. Carol, hi. Okay. Yes. Yes. It is. How how about I'll, catch up with you in the ice age? Can I stay? That would be no. Hi. Is this a bad time? No. No. It's it's it's the stone age. You look great. I, I hate that. I'm sorry. Thanks. You look good too. Well, you know, in here, anyone who stands erect. So what's new? Still, a lesbian? Well, you never know. How's, How's the family? Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and that's Girl, why why are you here, Carol? I'm pregnant. Pregnant. Looks like she didn't leave in such a hurry after all. Oh, I think this is the episode of 3's company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. Then I've already seen this one. Are you through with that? Yeah. Sorry. The swallowing slowed me down. Whose little ball of paper is this? Oh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realized I didn't need the note. So I balled it up, and now I wish I was dead. She already fluffed that pillow. Monica, you know, you already fluffed, but it's fine. Look. I'm sorry, guys. I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. Yes. And we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. Would you relax? You do this every time they come. The place looks great. You got a Beautiful lasagna here that looks good enough to avoid touching. Monica. Hi. Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like you're like all chaotic Twirly. You know? Not not in a good way. Yeah. Calm down. You don't see Ross getting all Chaotic and twirly every time they come. That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. You see, he's the prince. Apparently, they had some big ceremony before I was born. What? Ugly naked guy got a Thighmaster. Oh. Has anybody seen my engagement ring? Yeah. It's beautiful. Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god. Don't touch Stop. Oh, like I wasn't threading tomorrow enough having to give it back to him. Hi, Barry. Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil that stomped on your heart in front of your entire family. Oh, god. And now I'm gonna have to return the ring without the ring, which makes So much harder. It's easy, Rachel. We'll find it. Won't wait. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Look. It's gonna be okay. You're give it back to him. It'll all be over, and we'll eat a lot of ice cream. Okay. Okay. It's a little pear shaped diamond. I'll tell you what. Any diamond ring we find, we'll run it by you. Alright. When did you have it on last? Go away. Probably right before she lost it. You don't get a lot of doy these days. No. I had it this morning. I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with Dinah. Oh, don't be mad. You didn't. Oh, I'm sorry. I gave you one job. Oh, but look how straight those noodles are. Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in lasagna. I just can't do it. Boys, we're going in. That is not a happy high. Carol's pregnant. Oh, I found it. What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah. Do that for another 2 hours. You might be where I am right about now. Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, Man? Well, now how how do you fit into this whole thing? Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved. Basically, it's totally up to me. She is so great. I miss her. What does she mean by involved? I mean, presumably, the biggest part of your job is done and the most enjoyable. Phoebe, say something. Anyway, they want me to go down to this sonogram thing with them tomorrow. Wow. Yeah. Remember back when life was simpler and she was just a lesbian? God, those were the days. Well, so what are you gonna do? I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. Well, this is still ruined. Right? Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. What's that curry taste? Curry. I I think they're great. I I I really do. I You remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she? They all had a thing for him. I'm sorry. Why is this girl going to call me? Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in Cooking or food or I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant. No, mom. I don't have a restaurant. I work in a restaurant. Well, they don't have to know that. Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? Yes. Oh, we're having spaghetti. That's easy. Actually, we were going to have lasagna. Oh, I love lasagna. Well, we're not having it. And why'd you bring it up? You know how he latches on. I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish on my part, but were you planning on bringing up the whole baby lesbian thing? Because I I think it might take some of the hate off me. What that Rachel did to her life, we ran into our parents at the club. They were not Playing very well. I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding, but $40,000 is a lot of money. Well, at least she has a chance to leave a van at the altar. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. It's an expression. No. It's not. Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been. Even when you were a kid and you were chubby and you had no friends, you were just fine. And you would read alone in your room and your puzzles. Look. There are people like Ross who need to Shoot for the stars with his museum and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are. I'm telling you. These are the people who never get cancer. They're happy with what they have. They're basically content like Cows. I think cows, dad? She knows how much I love cows. And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank god our little harmonica doesn't seem to have that. I'm telling you, sweetheart, you're gonna be fine. Thank you, daddy. Oh, So this does work. So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news? No little anecdotes to share with the folks? Look. I, I realize you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and so, well, Here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.", "confidence": 0.99845576, "words": [{"word": "what", "start": 1.92, "end": 2.1599998, "confidence": 0.98912257,

understand is for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. Yeah. Right. Serious? Oh, yeah.\n\nEverything you need to know is in that first kiss. Absolutely. Yeah. I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act. You know?\n\nI mean, it's like the stand up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes Yeah. And and it's not that we don't like the comedian. It's just that that's That's not why we bought the ticket. You see, the problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, You girls are always looking for the comedian again. You know?\n\nAnd they weren't in the car. We're fighting traffic. Basically, just trying to stay awake. Yeah. Well, word of advice.\n\nBring back the comedian. Otherwise, next time, you're gonna find yourself sitting at home listening to that album alone. Are we still talking about sex? No. It's good.\n\nIt it is good. It's just that, mhmm, doesn't she seem a little angry? Well, she has issues. Does she? It's easy trying to live with mister Hey.\n\nI'm evolving. She's out and banging other women over the head with a club while she sits at home trying to get the Mastodon smell out of the carpet. Marsha, see, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like, Gee, that glacier is getting kinda close.\n\nSee? Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex wife? My no. No? Yes.\n\nIt is. Carol, hi. Okay. Yes. Yes.\n\nIt is. How how about I'll, catch up with you in the ice age? Can I stay? That would be no. Hi.\n\nIs this a bad time? No. No. It's it's it's the stone age. You look great.\n\nI, I hate that. I'm sorry. Thanks. You look good too. Well, you know, in here, anyone who stands erect.\n\nSo what's new? Still, a lesbian? Well, you never know. How's, How's the family? Marty's still totally paranoid.\n\nOh, and that's Girl, why why are you here, Carol? I'm pregnant. Pregnant. Looks like she didn't leave in such a hurry after all. Oh, I think this is the episode of 3's company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.\n\nThen I've already seen this one. Are you through with that? Yeah. Sorry. The swallowing slowed me down.\n\nWhose little ball of paper is this? Oh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realized I didn't need the note. So I balled it up, and now I wish I was dead. She already fluffed that pillow.\n\nMonica, you know, you already fluffed, but it's fine. Look. I'm sorry, guys. I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. Yes.\n\nAnd we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. Would you relax? You do this every time they come. The place looks great. You got a Beautiful lasagna here that looks good enough to avoid touching.\n\nMonica. Hi. Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like you're like all chaotic Twirly. You know?\n\nNot not in a good way. Yeah. Calm down. You don't see Ross getting all Chaotic and twirly every time they come. That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong.\n\nYou see, he's the prince. Apparently, they had some big ceremony before I was born. What? Ugly naked guy got a Thighmaster. Oh.\n\nHas anybody seen my engagement ring? Yeah. It's beautiful. Oh, god. Oh, god.\n\nOh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god.\n\nOh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god. Don't touch Stop. Oh, like I wasn't threading tomorrow enough having to give it back to him.\n\nHi, Barry. Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil that stomped on your heart in front of your entire family. Oh, god. And now I'm gonna have to return the ring without the ring, which makes So much harder.\n\nIt's easy, Rachel. We'll find it. Won't wait. Oh, yeah. Yeah.\n\nOkay. Look. It's gonna be okay. You're give it back to him. It'll all be over, and we'll eat a lot of ice cream.\n\nOkay. Okay. It's a little pear shaped diamond. I'll tell you what. Any diamond ring we find, we'll run it by you.\n\nAlright. When did you have it on last? Go away. Probably right before she lost it. You don't get a lot of doy these days.\n\nNo. I had it this morning. I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with Dinah. Oh, don't be mad. You didn't.\n\nOh, I'm sorry. I gave you one job. Oh, but look how straight those noodles are. Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in lasagna. I just can't do it.\n\nBoys, we're going in. That is not a happy high. Carol's pregnant. Oh, I found it. What?\n\nWhat? What? What? What? What?\n\nYeah. Do that for another 2 hours. You might be where I am right about now. Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, Man? Well, now how how do you fit into this whole thing?\n\nWell, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved. Basically, it's totally up to me. She is so great. I miss her. What does she mean by involved?\n\nI mean, presumably, the biggest part of your job is done and the most enjoyable. Phoebe, say something. Anyway, they want me to go down to this sonogram thing with them tomorrow. Wow. Yeah.\n\nRemember back when life was simpler and she was just a lesbian? God, those were the days. Well, so what are you gonna do? I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.\n\nWell, this is still ruined. Right? Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. What's that curry taste? Curry.\n\nI I think they're great. I I I really do. I You remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she? They all had a thing for him.\n\nI'm sorry. Why is this girl going to call me? Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in Cooking or food or I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant. No, mom.\n\nI don't have a restaurant. I work in a restaurant. Well, they don't have to know that. Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? Yes.\n\nOh, we're having spaghetti. That's easy. Actually, we were going to have lasagna. Oh, I love lasagna. Well, we're not having it.\n\nAnd why'd you bring it up? You know how he latches on. I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish on my part, but were you planning on bringing up the whole baby lesbian thing? Because I I think it might take some of the hate off me. What that Rachel did to her life, we ran into our parents at the club.\n\nThey were not Playing very well. I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding, but $40,000 is a lot of money. Well, at least she has a chance to leave a van at the altar. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing.\n\nIt's an expression. No. It's not. Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been.\n\nEven when you were a kid and you were chubby and you had no friends, you were just fine. And you would read alone in your room and your puzzles. Look. There are people like Ross who need to Shoot for the stars with his museum and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are.\n\nI'm telling you. These are the people who never get cancer. They're happy with what they have. They're basically content like Cows. I think cows, dad?\n\nShe knows how much I love cows. And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank god our little harmonica doesn't seem to have that. I'm telling you, sweetheart, you're gonna be fine. Thank you, daddy. Oh, So this does work.\n\nSo, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news? No little anecdotes to share with the folks? Look.\n\nI, I realize you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and so, well, Here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.", "paragraphs": [{"sentences": [{"text": "What you guys don't understand is for us, kissing is as important as any part of
