It is unbelievable.\n\nI've I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life. She was in the Israeli army. Luckily, none of the bullets hit the engine block, so we made it to the border. But just barely, and I I'd I've been talking about myself all night long.\n\nI'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories. Once once I got on the subway. Right?\n\nAnd it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn Just for the hell of it. We talked to, like, 2.

What kind of relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend? I suppose mainly sexual. I'm sorry it didn't work out. What not work out?\n\nI'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story? Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted. How could you get involved with a woman like this?\n\nWell, you know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is I get all the good stuff, all the fun, All the talking, all the sex, and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy. Yeah. That is not True. Ross, is this your fantasy?\n\nNo. Of course not. Yeah. Yeah. So you guys don't mind going out Someone else who's going out with someone else?\n\nI couldn't do it. Good for you, Joey. When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people that she is. You know, one time, I went out with a guy who had just gotten divorced, and it was really hard. His kids like me better than him.\n\nStevie, what does this have to do with Chandler's thing? Oh, nothing. But I didn't have anything on that topic, Let's talk about another way.

I haven't used all those attachments on the vacuum except for that little round one with the bristles. I don't know what that's for. Oh, yeah. Nobody knows, and we're not supposed to ask.\n\nOh, I think. Very clean. It's gray. Really? It looks gray.\n\nOh, I I I see you move the green ottoman. Uh-oh. How did that happen? I don't know. I I thought it looked better there.\n\nThen I and, also, it's an extra cedar on the coffee table. Well Yeah. It's It's interesting. But you know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot.\n\nI just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while. Can't wait for trying to move the green ottoman.\n\nThank god you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your That's right out. Guys, I am not that bad. Yeah. You are, Monica.\n\nRemember I lived with you? You were like a little, you know, Reek. Reek. Reek. Reek.\n\nReek. Reek. That is so unfair. Oh, come on.
